ABSTRACT ligase is the second enzyme in the branch of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan assembly, and recognized as an attractive antimicrobial target. In this work, the D-Ala-D-Ala ligase of Helicobacter pylori strain SS1 (HpDdl) was kinetically and structurally characterized. The determined apparent Km of ATP (0.87 lM), the Km1 (1.89 mM) and Km2 of D-Ala (627 mM), and the kcat (115 min21) at pH 8.0 indicated its relatively weak binding affinity and poor catalytic activity against the substrate D-Ala in vitro. However, by complementary assay of expressing HpDdl in Escherichia coli Dddl mutant, HpDdl was confirmed to be capable of D-Ala-D-Ala ligating in vivo. Through sequence alignment with other members of the D-Ala-D-X ligase superfamily, HpDdl keeps two conservatively substituted residues (Ile16 and Leu241) and two nonconserved residues (Leu308 and Tyr311) broadly located in the active region of the enzyme. Kinetic analyses against the corresponding HpDdl mutants (I16V, L241Y, L241F, L308T, and Y311S) suggested that these residues, especially Leu308 and Tyr311, might partly contribute to the unique catalytic properties of the enzyme. This was fairly proved by the crystal structure of HpDdl, which revealed that there is a 310-helix (including residues from Gly306 to Leu312) near the D-Ala binding region in the C-terminal domain, where HpDdl has two sequence deletions compared with other homologs. Such 310-helix may participate in D-Ala binding and conformational change of the enzyme. Our present work hopefully provides useful information for understanding the D-Ala-D-Ala ligase of Helicobacter pylori.

INTRODUCTION The initial isolation of Helicobacter pylori in 1982 by Marshall and Warren, the Nobel Prize laureates in physiology and medicine 2005, heralded a new era in gastric microbiology.1 H. pylori has been known as a human pathogen associated with many diseases involving gastroduodenal tissue, e.g. gastritis, peptic ulceration, and gastric cancer.2 Unfortunately, the rate of H. pylori resistance against antimicrobial agents has much increased just as that of other pathogens worldwide,3 thus emphasizing an urgent need for developing new antibacterial agents. Since the last decade, the availability of complete microbial genome sequences has facilitated target-based screening for novel antibiotic development.4 As indispensable for bacteria metabolism and absent in human, the D-alanine-D-alanine ligase (Ddl, EC 6.3.2.4) has been considered as a putative antimicrobial drug target5 and a lot of inhibitor screening efforts have been made.6­9 Ddl, following the alanine racemase (Alr), serves as the second enzyme of the D-Ala branch in the assembly of peptidoglycan precursors in cytoplasm.10 It is an ATP-dependent enzyme, and its catalytic mechanism is supposed to proceed via the following steps: first, the initial D-Ala (N-terminal) is bound and phosphorylated, and subsequently, the peptide bond is formed by the second D-Ala (C-terminal) in a nucleophilic reaction with loss of inorganic phosphate.11 The prodGrant sponsor: State Key Program of Basic Research of China; Grant numbers: 2004CB58905, 2007CB914304, 2006AA09Z447; Grant sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China; Grant numbers: 30525024, 90713046, 20721003; Grant sponsor: Shanghai Science and Technology Commission; Grant numbers: 06JC14080, 03DZ19228; Grant sponsor: Foundation of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Grant number: KSCX1-YWR-18. *Correspondence to: Xu Shen, Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.

uct D-Ala-D-Ala is then incorporated into the cell wall precursor UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-Ala-g-D-Glu-m-DAPD-Ala-D-Ala by the action of UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide synthetase (MurF). Since the initial research on purification and enzymatic kinetics characterization of the Streptococcus faecalis Ddl was presented by Neuhaus in 1960s,12 Ddls from different bacteria species, e.g. Salmonella typhimurium,13 Escherichia coli,11 Leuconostoc mesenteroides,14 Streptomyces lavendulae,15 and some Ddl homologs, e.g. VanA,16,17 VanB,18 and VanC,19 from vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VREs), have been extensively characterized. The crystal structures of E. coli DdlB (EcDdlB, PDB code 2DLN),20 L. mesenteroides Ddl (LmeDdl, PDB code 1EHI)21 and VanA (PDB code 1E4E)22 coupled with ADP and a reaction intermediate analog have revealed the detailed structure information on the interactions between the substrates and residues in the active site of Ddl. Lately, the crystal structure of the apo form of Ddl from Thermus caldophilus (ThcDdl, PDB code 2FB9)23 was solved, which supplied some data of the substrate-induced conformational changes. In addition, an allosteric inhibitor was discovered and co-crystallized with the Ddl from Staphylococcus aureus (StaDdl, PDB code 2I80).24 In this work, we identified a new ddl gene (GenBank accession number DQ009011) encoding Ddl from H. pylori strain SS1 (HpDdl) and reported the enzymatic and structural characterization of this enzyme. Compared with EcDdlB, HpDdl showed much lower affinity to the substrate D-Ala at both binding subsites, and lower turnover number in vitro. Considering the four residues (Ile16, Leu241,Leu308 and Tyr311) that are not fully conserved within the active region of HpDdl as compared with other Ddl homologs15 [Fig. 1(A)], five single-point HpDdl mutants were thus constructed and analyzed kinetically to explore the possible effects of these residues on the enzymatic activity. The crystal structure of HpDdl revealed a unique short 310-helix in the C-terminal domain, which may influence the substrate binding and conformational change of the enzyme. Furthermore, this low efficiency ligase was validated to possess in vivo activity of D-Ala-D-Ala ligation as indicated by the complementary assay with an E. coli Dddl mutant. METHODS
Materials

NC_000915 and NC_000921), two PCR primers (forward: 50 -AGCCGGATTGAGCACGTTATTAGTC-30 and reverse: 50 -AGGGCTATGGTGGTCTATAAAAGTG-30 ) were designed to amplify the corresponding region including ddl gene from the genome of H. pylori strain SS1. According to the sequencing result of the amplified DNA segment, another pair of primers (sense: 50 -GGGAGT TTGCATATGGAGTTTTGC-30 and anti-sense: 50 -GCGT TCTCGAGTTACTTATTCTTTTGG-30 ) were synthesized to amplify ddl gene from the genome again. The PCR products were cloned into a prokaryotic expression vector pET-28b (Novagen) to produce a recombinant protein with an N-terminal His-tag.
Site-directed mutagenesis

Five HpDdl single point mutants I16V, L241Y, L241F, L308T, and Y311S were constructed with Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the instruction manual and verified by sequencing. The PCR primers containing the desired single mutations (in boldface) are as follows (sense only): 50 -GTTTTGAGCAT GAAGTCAGTATTGTGAGTGCG-30 (I16V), 50 -GCCTAA CAAACAGGAATTTTACGATTTCAAACAAAAATATTTGG30 (L214Y), 50 -GCCTAACAAACAGGAATTTTTCGATTT CAAACAAAAATATTTGG-30 (L241F), 50 -CCCCATTCCT GGCAGTACGGCCAATTATTTGTTTGATG-30 (L308T) and 50 -CCTGGCAGTTTGGCCAATTCTTTGTTTGATGATTTT AAAAC-30 (Y311S).
Cloning of ddlB gene from E. coli

Similar to the cloning procedure of pET28b-HpDdl, the ddlB gene of E. coli was cloned from the genome of JM109 based on the sequence of E. coli strain K12 (GenBank accession number NC_000913). The DNA fragment containing ddlB was amplified by PCR with the primers (sense: 50 -TTTGGCATATGACTGATAAAATCGC-30 and antisense: 50 -AACCAAGCTTTTAGTCCGCCAGTTC-30 ), and cloned into pET28b. The resulting plasmid pET28bEcDdlB was sequenced and the deduced protein sequence was identical to that of EcDdlB (GenBank No.AAC73203) except for one mutation G194D.
Expression and purification of HpDdl and EcDdlB

H. pylori strain SS1 was obtained from Shanghai Institute of Digestive Disease. E. coli strains BL21 (DE3) and JM109 were purchased from Stratagene. All chemicals were of reagent grade or ultra-pure quality, and commercially available.

The recombinant plasmid pET28b-HpDdl was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) for expression. After purification by HisBind resin (Novagen), HpDdl was dialyzed against buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA) to remove imidazole. The purification of the five HpDdl mutants and EcDdlB were handled in the same way as for the wild-type HpDdl. To obtain untagged HpDdl, a new fusion protein GSTHpDdl was expressed with vector pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and digested by thrombin protease

The dimerization feature of HpDdl was investigated by size-exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column through an AKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The protein samples (26 lM) were loaded on the column and eluted with running buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, and the absorbance at 280 nm was monitored.
Glutaraldehyde crosslinking SDS-PAGE

Also using the PK/LDH-coupled assay method,13 the initial catalytic velocity of HpDdl in the reaction mixture containing 500 lM ATP and 10 mM D-Ala was set as a control. Different substrates, D-Ala, Gly, D-Ser, and D-lactate of 200 mM, were added into the reaction mixture, respectively, and the catalytic velocities were calculated and compared with the control.
Functional complementary assay of HpDdl in E. coli Dddl mutant

Briefly, after dialysis against buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl), HpDdl was mixed with different concentrations of glutaraldehyde to a total volume of 30 lL and incubated at 48C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 lL of loading buffer and heated at 998C for 5 min before SDS-PAGE with 10% gels.
Enzymatic activity assay

The enzymatic activities of wild-type and five mutated HpDdl and EcDdlB were evaluated by using pyruvate kinase (PK)/lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-coupled spectrophotometric assay system.13 All assays were conducted in a 96-well plate system (Tecan GENios reader) at 308C. The assay solution contained 100 mM Tris, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM PEP, 0.3­0.7 mM b-NADH, 5­ 20 lL/mL PK/LDH solution (Sigma), ATP and D-Ala at desired concentrations. The reaction was initiated by the addition of Ddl enzymes into the assay solution, and the kinetic parameters were determined by double-reciprocal plots as reported elsewhere.15,17,26,27 The basic equation for Ddl [Eq. (1)] was derived from the steady-state kinetics for two identical substrate molecules of D-Ala. In the case of [S] ) Km1, Eq. (2) was used instead of Eq. (1) to determine the kcat and Km2 values. With the resultant Vmax value, a subsequent plot of [S](1/v 2 1/Vmax) against 1/[S] [Eq. (3)] provided the Km1 value. Since HpDdl was very difficult to saturate with D-Ala, Km1 was calculated from activities measured at low concentrations of D-Ala (0.5­3 mM) with Eq. (4).17 1 1 Km2 1 Km1 Km2 1 ¼ þ þ v Vmax Vmax ½S Vmax ½S2 1 1 Km2 1 ¼ þ v Vmax Vmax ½S  ½S 1 1 À v Vmax  ¼ Km2 Km1 Km2 1 þ Vmax Vmax ½S ð1Þ

Another recombinant plasmid pET15b-HpDdl with ampicillin resistance was constructed to avoid the resistance confliction of kanamycin between vector pET28b and ATM718 (DddlA DddlB::kan).29 After electro-transformation, ATM718 containing pET15b-HpDdl was selected on M9 minimal agar medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 lg/mL), kanamycin (50 lg/mL) and D-Ala-D-Ala (400 lg/mL). ATM718 strain with or without pET15bHpDdl was cultured in M9 liquid medium complemented with D-Ala-D-Ala at 378C before adjusted to certain concentration in new medium without D-Ala-D-Ala. To thoroughly remove the remaining D-Ala-D-Ala, ATM718 cells were centrifuged and washed by fresh medium for several times. Then IPTG (0.2 mM) or D-Ala-D-Ala was added into the culture, which was monitored by OD600 per hour.
Protein crystallization and diffraction

HpDdl was dialyzed against buffer D (20 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2), concentrated to 4­8 mg/mL, and then crystallized at 48C in hanging drops equilibrated versus the reservoir solution (0.1M HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% PEG6000, 5% MPD), with crystals reaching dimensions of 0.05 3 0.05 3 0.4 mm3 in about 4 months. Crystals were soaked in mother liquor containing a glycerol concentration of 15% as cryoprotectant before flash freezing. A set of native data was collected at beam line BL-17A at the Photon Factory, Japan using the ° X-ray beam at a single wavelength (1.0000A) and dif° . The data set was indexed and procfracted up to 2.4 A essed using HKL2000.30 Summary of the diffraction data statistics is given in Table I.

26,695 and J99 genomes are 97.1% and 96.5%, respectively. Although distributed into the DdlB group of DAla-D-X ligase superfamily,17 HpDdl has only 24.2% identity to E. coli DdlB, a little higher than the identity to DdlA (23.9%), whereas lower than that to VanA (26.5%), VanC (26.1%), and the Ddl from L. mesenteroides (24.4%), a lactic acid bacterium.14 However, most of the residues involved in substrate binding15 are conserved in HpDdl [Fig. 1(A)]. For example, the three residues Glu13, Ser177, and Tyr247 can be nicely aligned with the EcDdlB residues Glu15-Ser150-Tyr216, which were proposed to assist D-Ala binding and the deprotonation steps in concert as the catalytic triad.20 On the other hand, four HpDdl resides are not fully conserved in the active region through the alignment. In detail, residues Ile16, Leu308 and Tyr311 in HpDdl replace Val18, Thr278, and Ser281 in EcDdlB, while Leu241 of HpDdl has two counterparts at the same position. One is Phe in VanA, VanC2, and the Ddl from S. lavendulae; the other is Tyr in the rest of Ddl homologs.
Dimerization feature of HpDdl

To investigate the assembly feature of HpDdl, sizeexclusion chromatography and chemical cross-linking assays were performed. The results of the both experiments (data not shown) suggested that HpDdl probably exists only as a dimer in solution, similar to EcDdlB.11 Further evidence of this conclusion could be found from the crystal structure of HpDdl in this work. Calculated by CNS,31 the buried area at the dimer interface is about ° 2911 A2, which is a significantly larger value than biologically relevant buried area, suggesting that HpDdl is dimeric.

cross-rotation and translation steps, which resulted in an obviously higher score for the best solution. Subsequent structure refinement was carried out with CNS using standard protocols (energy minimization, simulated annealing, water picking, and B-factor refinement) including bulk-solvent correction and anisotropic B-scaling, and model building was facilitated by using the program Coot.32 The final structure refinement was performed using the maximum likelihood algorithm implemented in the program REFMAC5.33 The stereochemical quality of the structure models during the course of refinement and model building was evaluated with the program PROCHECK.34 The statistics of structure refinement is summarized in Table I. The structure of HpDdl has been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank under accession code 2PVP. RESULTS

The sequence identities of HpDdl from H. pylori strain SS1 to the protein sequences presumed from ddl genes in

As shown in Figure 2(A), HpDdl exhibited only negligible activity in a pH range of 5.5­7.0, and showed maximum activity at pH 9.0 (or above), similar to the case for the Ddl from S. faecalis.12 Since the enzyme activities of the two coupled enzymes (PK and LDH) used in the assay are quite low at pH above 9.0, measurement of HpDdl activity at higher pH values could not be performed. For the temperature profile in Figure 2(B), the relative activity of HpDdl increased gradually between 25 and 508C, and dropped rapidly from 50 to 708C, with an optimum around 508C. The kinetic parameters of HpDdl were determined with respect to substrates D-Ala and ATP at two different pH values. As shown in Table II, different from the previously reported S. typhimurium DdlA, E. coli DdlA and DdlB,11 HpDdl was very difficult to saturate with D-Ala. As a result, the Km1 and Km2 values for D-Ala were very high. At pH 8.0, the Km1 and Km2 of HpDdl were about

The effects of pH (A) and temperature (B) on HpDdl activity. For pH profile analysis, the activity of HpDdl was measured in different buffers (100 mM MES-NaOH for pH 5.5-7.0 and 100 mM Tris-HCl for pH 7.5-9.0) at 308C. Saturated amounts of PK and LDH were determined and included in each pH conditions. For evaluating the influence of temperature on HpDdl activity, the enzymatic activity assays were processed from 25 to 708C at pH 7.5.

200-fold and 500-fold higher than the Km1 and Km2 of EcDdlB, respectively. However, the apparent ATP Km of HpDdl was about 40-fold lower than that of EcDdlB. In addition, the kcat of HpDdl had a nearly 10-fold drop compared with that of EcDdlB, and was close to the kcat (100 min21) of Ddl from S. lavendulae.15 Therefore, the kcat/Km2 of HpDdl was 5000-fold lower than that of EcDdlB, suggesting that HpDdl has a far lower catalytic efficiency than EcDdlB. As the pH value increasing from 8.0 to 9.0, the apparent Km of HpDdl against ATP increased by twofold, while the Km2 of D-Ala decreased by threefold (Table II). In the meantime, the Km1 of DAla and kcat varied in a relatively small range and the kcat/Km2 was elevated by nearly fourfold, thereby indicating an obvious increase of HpDdl catalytic efficiency. In addition, the kinetic parameters of HpDdl without N-terminal His-tag were comparatively close to those of the

tagged HpDdl at pH 8.0 (Table II), indicating that the small His-tag rendered no influence on the catalytic activity of the ligase. Since the enzymatic activity of HpDdl against D-Ala was discovered to be quite low, we performed a substrate preference assay to determine the HpDdl activities against different amino acid substrates. As an alternative substrate for S. typhimurium DdlA, E. coli DdlA and DdlB, Gly was revealed to show the maximal reaction velocities similar to the substrate D-Ala, but higher Km values.11 As shown in Figure 3, after adding 200 mM Gly into the reaction mixture containing 10 mM D-Ala, the activity of HpDdl slightly increased as compared with the background activity against 10 mM D-Ala, indicating that HpDdl could only catalyze the D-Ala-Gly (maybe also Gly­Gly) ligation at a very low efficiency. This result was somewhat coincident with the published work,35 which identified the components of H. pylori murein and revealed that the C-terminal of N-acetylglucosaminyl-Nacetylmuramyl-pentapeptide is partially composed of Gly. Furthermore, following addition of D-lactate and D-Ser into the reaction mixture respectively, VanA17 and VanC19 were reported to exhibit much higher activities than the background activity against D-Ala (0.8­10 mM). However, HpDdl showed negligible increase in activity when 200 mM D-Ser was added into the reaction mixture (see Fig. 3). For D-lactate, the activity of HpDdl even dropped compared with the background value, suggesting that D-lactate might act as an ``inhibitor'' against the DAla-D-Ala ligation catalyzed by HpDdl. In contrast, the relative activity of HpDdl against 200 mM D-Ala was much higher than those against Gly, D-Ser and D-lactate at the same concentration. All these results convincingly proved that the most suitable substrate for HpDdl, especially at the second binding subsite (C-terminal), is still D-Ala in vitro. To investigate whether the low binding affinity of D-Ala to HpDdl has some connection with the conservatively substituted residues (Ile16 and Leu241) and nonconserved residues (Leu308 and Tyr311) in the active region, we replaced these residues with their conserved counterparts and carried out enzymatic kinetics characterization of these mutants. In this case, five HpDdl mutants (I16V, L241Y, L241F, L308T, and Y311S) were constructed [Fig. 1(A)]. As indicated in Table II, the apparent ATP Km and DAla Km1 of mutant I16V were comparable to those of the wild type HpDdl, and the increase of Km2 especially at pH 9.0 (151­274 mM) and slight decrease of kcat suggested that I16V exhibited a weaker binding affinity to the second D-Ala and a little lower catalytic efficiency. For mutant L241Y, both the D-Ala Km1 and Km2 increased, and the apparent ATP Km decreased, which implied that the binding affinity of mutant L241Y to DAla at both subsites decreased, while to the substrate ATP increased; and the obvious drop of kcat demonstrated its lower catalytic activity than that of the wildPROTEINS

For mutant L241F, in comparison with the wild-type HpDdl, its apparent ATP Km, D-Ala Km1 and kcat only slightly increased, whereas the D-Ala Km2 was similar. As a result, the kcat/ Km2 for mutant L241F showed a modest elevation, indicating a little higher activity of mutant L241F than that of the wild-type enzyme. As far as the mutant L308T is concerned, all its kinetic parameters were somewhat different from those of the wild-type HpDdl. The fact that the apparent ATP Km and D-Ala Km2 increased by nearly 18 and 4-fold, respectively, and the D-Ala Km1 decreased by threefold suggested that mutant L308T exhibited much lower binding affinity against ATP and the second D-Ala (C-terminal), while displayed a higher binding affinity to D-Ala at the first position (N-terminal). In addition, according to the kcat/Km2 value in Table II, mutant L308T is about onefold less efficient than the wild-type enzyme. As for mutant Y311S, compared with the wildtype HpDdl, the decreased D-Ala Km2, and the similar Km1 and kcat values showed its best binding affinity to the second D-Ala and the highest catalytic efficiency, particularly at pH 9.0 (Table II).

continuously to 1.7, while that of the blank medium dropped to about 0.1. This result validated the dependency of ATM718 on D-Ala-D-Ala and the reliability of this culturing condition. Subsequently ATM718 was transformed with pET15b-HpDdl and incubated overnight before diluted to OD600 of 0.5. The transformed ATM718 in medium containing D-Ala-D-Ala grew constantly till OD600 of 2.1 after 5 h, as that of the untransformed. The slight increase of OD600 in blank medium at the first hour might be due to the D-Ala-D-Ala stored within bacteria during overnight incubation. After this storage consumed, the OD600 started to decrease and reached below 0.4 at last. As for the transformed ATM718 induced by IPTG, which we most concerned, the OD600 also increased steadily, although slower than

Complementary assay

As indicated above, the in vitro enzymatic activity assay of HpDdl has revealed its quite low activity. To further evaluate the in vivo catalytic efficiency of HpDdl, we carried out a complementary assay with a conditional lethal mutant of E. coli.29 As shown in Figure 4, the mutant ATM718 (DddlA DddlB::kan) was first transferred into fresh M9 medium with or without D-Ala-D-Ala and adjusted to OD600 at about 0.3. From then on till 4 h later, the OD600 of the supplementary medium increased

Overall structure of HpDdl

To better elucidate the enzymatic character of HpDdl, we also solved its crystal structure by X-ray diffraction. There are two HpDdl monomers forming a dimer in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Except for some disordered residues at the C-terminal, the structure is well defined, with the electron density maps continuous from residues 0 (an additional histidine from the N-terminal His-tag) to 328 for monomer A, and 0­331 for monomer B. In addition, residues 239­255 in the catalytic xloop20­22 are also disordered with no visible electron density in monomer B. However, this loop is well defined in monomer A and extends away from the structure, similar to the ThcDdl,23 which was also crystallized as apo form. Besides this loop, there are some regions (residues 78­81, 156­164, and 211­212) exposed to the solvent containing Ca movement of root-mean-square ° deviation (RMSD) over 2 A on superimposition of the two monomers. Like other members of the D-Ala-D-X ligase superfamily,20­24 the HpDdl monomer can be divided into three domains [Fig. 5(A)]. The N-terminal domain runs from the N terminus to Arg120 and is composed of three ahelices and eight b-strands, one a-helix [a2, as labeled in Fig. 1(B), residues 54­58] more than that of the searching model VanA.22 The central domain includes residues Ile121 to Val213, consisting of four a-helices and four b-strands. Compared with the corresponding

domain of VanA,22 residues 158­161 form an additional short a-helix [a6 in Fig. 1(B)]. The C-terminal domain (Lys214 to C terminus) comprises two a-helices and five b-strands. The second b-strand [b14 in Fig. 1(B), residues 226­234] in this domain is relatively longer than its counterpart in VanA,22 and the significant difference is the nearly opposite direction of the x-loop, which may determine the enzyme conformation as ``open'' or ``closed.''23 Another interesting finding is that between the last b-strand and the last a-helix [b17 and a9 in Fig. 1(B)], there are only 13 residues (303­315), in which a 310-helix of seven residues was formed [residues 306­312, Fig. 5(B)] as calculated with the program DSSP.37 However, all the other reported Ddl homologs20­24 possess 21 residues at this region and contain an a-helix of eight residues [Fig. 1(B), alignments not shown for LmeDdl, ThcDdl and StaDdl]. As indicated in Figure 1(B), the structure-based sequence alignment using DALI-server28 revealed that HpDdl has two deletions (each including four residues) in this region, inconsistent with the alignment using program ClustalX25 shown in Figure 1(A). By superimposition of the structure of HpDdl with other homologs [Fig. 5(C)], we found that in Ddls the N-terminal domain shows the most structural diversity, especially the portion apart from the active region. By forming the ATP binding site together with the C-terminal domain, the central domain seems to be much conserved in structure. The C-terminal domain possesses a flexible x-loop and is comparatively conserved in the structure. Surprisingly, unlike the apo ThcDdl, whose central domain shows rotational movement between the ``open'' and ``closed'' forms with a total rotation of 178,23 HpDdl exhibits very similar major conformations of the three domains as compared with those of the ligand-bound EcDdlB,20 except for the x-loop and 310helix regions [Fig. 5(C)].
Ligand-binding site

For the conformational likeness between HpDdl and EcDdlB, the ligands ADP and phosphinophosphate inhibitor can be approximately modeled in the active region of HpDdl by superimposition [Fig. 6(A)]. Since in HpDdl most of the residues involved in substrates binding are conserved and the main construction of active site is similar to that of EcDdlB, here we only show some residues supposed to interact with D-Ala in the 310-helix (see Fig. 1) and the mutated residues plus their counterparts in EcDdlB.20 Like Val18 of EcDdlB, Ile16 located in the first round of the first a-helix in the N-terminal domain of HpDdl, with its side chain pointing to the active region. Since the x-loop extends out of the apo HpDdl, the residue ° Leu241 is 18 A (Ca distance) apart from its coordinate EcDdlB Tyr210. Also as shown in Figure 6(A), four residues (Gly276, Thr278, Ser281, and Leu282) in EcDdlB

have interactions with the ligand phosphinate [standing for D-Ala, Fig. 1(A)]. However, only one of their counterparts Gly306 in HpDdl holds similar position close enough to the phosphinate. Leu308 takes a reverse movement from the ligands and its coordinate Thr278 of EcDdlB. Interestingly, the residue Tyr311, whose main chain is farther than EcDdlB Ser281 from the inhibitor, possesses a side chain also facing to the a-carboxylic acid group of the phosphinate, making the hydroxyl group of

its side chain close enough to the ligand. Similarly, the main chain of neighboring Leu312 is too far to interact with the phosphinate as its counterpart EcDdlB Leu282. So finally, it seems that the interaction between substrate D-Ala and the C-terminal of HpDdl is much weaker than that of EcDdlB, coincident with the lower binding affinity of HpDdl to D-Ala in the enzymatic assay. In addition, this superimposition-revealed weak interaction between HpDdl and the phosphinate inhibitor could be

partly proved by the inhibitory assay result that even at a concentration of 1 mM, phosphinate could only exhibit an inhibition rate of about 10% against HpDdl activity.

DISCUSSION Compared with other Ddls by kinetic parameters,11 HpDdl showed much poorer binding affinity to the DAla substrate and lower catalytic efficiency. The reliability of the enzymatic activity assay system used in this work was verified by EcDdlB as a positive control (Table II), whose kinetic parameters were similar to those previously published.11 Moreover, the untagged HpDdl had similar catalytic ability as the tagged HpDdl (Table II), thus excluding the possible influence of the N-terminal His-tag on the activity of the enzyme. Although HpDdl has higher sequence identities with VanA and VanC than E. coli DdlA and DdlB, the most

favorite substrate at the second binding position (C-terminal) of HpDdl was still D-Ala (see Fig. 3). On the other hand, an exploration to the murein structure of H. pylori confirmed that N-acetylglucosaminyl-N-acetylmuramyl-L-Ala-D-Glu-(g)-mDap-D-Ala-D-Ala is the basic monomeric subunit of the murein,35 the same as in E. coli. In addition, the complementary assay with E. coli Dddl mutant proved that HpDdl could catalyze D-Ala-DAla ligation when expressed in vivo (see Fig. 4). Furthermore, only one ddl gene exists in the genome of H. pylori38 and an essential gene analysis of H. pylori by global transposon mutagenesis showed that ddl is among the essential genes without transposon insertion.39 All the evidences mentioned above thus indicated that the main physiological function of HpDdl in vivo might also be related to the synthesis of D-Ala-D-Ala, identical with EcDdlB. Interestingly, a recent study shows that the alanine racemase (Alr) from H. pylori exclusively catalyses the conversion of L-Ala to D-isomer with Km value of

100 mM.40 Considering that Alr and Ddl are conterminous enzymes in the peptidoglycan assembly pathway, the low binding affinity to their substrates might be possibly in correlation with the inner environment and relatively slow growing speed of H. pylori. According to the result of sequence alignment, HpDdl Ile16 is presented instead of EcDdlB Val18 [Fig. 1(A)], which is the residue supposed to determine the chirality of the first D-Ala as substrate.20 However, the Km1 of I16V mutant was close to that of the wild-type enzyme, while the Km2 somewhat increased (Table II). As shown in Figure 6(A), since Ile16 lies at the edge of the active region with its side chain extending upon the ligand binding pocket, the length reduction of the side chain of Ile16 by Val substitution might slightly impair the entrance and binding of the second D-Ala substrate to the enzyme. Also as indicated in Fig. 1A, Leu241 of HpDdl corresponds to either Tyr210 of EcDdlB or Phe250 of VanC2. These two residues are supposed to involve in the substrate recognition (D-Ala or D-serine).19 Compared with the wild-type HpDdl, L241Y displayed increased binding affinity to ATP but decreased affinity to both of the two D-Ala substrates with a threefold dropped kcat value (Table II). Although the proper role of Leu241 is unclear since the x-loop of apo HpDdl extends out of the structure, it is feasible to take its counterpart Tyr210 as a reference. EcDdlB Tyr210 locates in the central region of the active site with its side chain close to not only the substrates ATP and D-Ala but also the key catalytic residues Lys215 and Tyr216 on the x-loop [Fig. 6(A)]. Therefore, the replacement of Leu241 by Tyr might disrupt the packing and interactions in the central active region of HpDdl, resulting in a reduction of enzymatic activity as observed. On the contrary, the kinetic parameters of mutant L241F just slightly changed as compared with those of the wild-type enzyme (Table II). The possible reason for this might be that both Leu and Phe have hydrophobic side chains and mutation of Leu to Phe might not strongly impact the environment of the active region in HpDdl. As for the mutant L308T, it is a little surprising that all its kinetic parameters changed to varying extents (Table II). In the crystal structure of EcDdlB-ADP-phosphinophosphate complex, the corresponding Thr278 can assist the spatial orientation of Ser281 by hydrogen bonds and interact with the second D-Ala substrate (C-terminal) via a water molecule.20 Therefore, mutation of Thr to Ile in Enterococcus faecalis Ddl caused complete inactivation of the enzyme.41 However, in our work, the binding affinity of L308T to the second D-Ala dropped obviously rather than increased (Table II). As shown in Figure 6(A), the side chain of Leu308 takes a nearly opposite direction compared with that of its counterpart EcDdlB Thr278. In the crystal structure of HpDdl, we found that ° around the side chain of Leu308 at distance of 3­7 A,

there are 10 nonpolar residues (Leu24, Leu28, Ile92, Leu94, Ile117, Ile284, Ile304, Pro305, Phe316, and Leu320) forming a totally hydrophobic environment [Fig. 6(B)]. Locating in the unique 310-helix [Figs. 5(B) and 1(B)] that may take part in D-Ala binding and conformational change of the enzyme, Leu308 probably acts as an anchor to fasten this 310-helix in catalytic process. Thus when Leu308 was mutated to Thr, whose side chain could not be incorporated into the hydrophobic hole, the 310-helix might be dislocated from the proper position, disrupting the interactions between residues (Gly306 and Tyr311) and the substrate [Fig. 6(B)], so the enzymatic activity changed a lot. In addition, a previous study reported that the EcDdlB mutant S281A displays a 500-fold increased Km2 compared with the wild-type enzyme,42 indicating residue S281 is indispensable for recognition of the second D-Ala substrate. In HpDdl, residue Tyr311 represents as the counterpart for EcDdlB Ser281 [Fig. 1(A)], whose hydroxyl group can form a hydrogen bond with a-carboxylic acid group of the second D-Ala substrate as revealed by the crystal structure of EcDdlB.20 The mutant Y311S showed improved binding affinity to the second D-Ala and increased catalytic activity, especially at pH 9.0 (Table II). As shown in Figure 6(A), due to the smaller side chain of Ser compared with Tyr, Y311S mutation might make the 310-helix move little closer to the second D-Ala substrate. Thus the packing of active region might be tighter and the interaction between enzyme and D-Ala could be facilitated (e.g. the side chain of mutated Ser311 and the main chain of neighboring Leu312 might be close enough to form hydrogen bonds with substrate D-Ala as Ser 281 and Leu282 in EcDdlB). However, since HpDdl has two deletions near the 310-helix region compared with other homologs [Fig. 1(B)], and the nearby Leu308 may be fastened in the hydrophobic region, the shift of main chain by mutation might be restricted. On the other hand, surrounding Tyr311 it seems that no proper residue can act as EcDdlB Thr278 to help in substrate binding by forming hydrogen bonds. Therefore, the elevation of enzymatic activity by this single point mutation for HpDdl was limited. Conclusively, the four HpDdl residues (Ile16, Leu241, Leu308, and Tyr311) not fully conserved among the active region, especially Leu308 and Tyr311, might be partially responsible for the distinctive enzymatic activity from other Ddl enzymes. Interestingly, these two residues are both found in the 310-helix, which is the most particular structural property for the active region of HpDdl. However, studies on some spontaneous inactive Ddl mutants from E. faecalis41 and Enterococcus faecium43 indicate that several residues beyond the substrate binding site are also critical for enzymatic activity, due to their contributions to the geometry maintenance of the catalytic pocket conformation in Ddl. On the other hand, when we tried to substitute the 13 residues between the

last b-strand and the last a-helix of HpDdl by the corresponding 21 residues in EcDdlB [Fig. 1(B)], the substituted protein only expressed as insoluble form, suggesting its incorrect folding. This result implied that other portions of the enzyme might also have some compatible structures to fit the 310-helix, e.g. the hydrophobic hole around Leu308. So it is complicated to give complete explanation for the low catalytic activity of HpDdl, although the unique 310-helix is believed to be one choice as suggested by both the kinetic and structural evidences. Unlike the apo ThcDdl,23 whose central domain showed a rotation from the ``closed'' form, HpDdl keeps a central domain without such a rotation rather in similar conformation to those of ligand-bound EcDdlB20 [Fig. 5(C)], VanA22 and apo StaDdl24 (PDB code 2I87). Therefore, the substrate-induced conformational changes for HpDdl might follow the presumption by Liu et al.24 that the central domain moves closer to the C-terminal domain to interact with both substrates, and concomitantly the x-loop covers the substrate-binding cleft and is then stabilized by interactions with both substrates. However, to get more exact procedures still needs the direct comparison of the same Ddl in both apo and ligand-bound forms. CONCLUSIONS Here we characterized the Ddl from H. pylori, which exhibited low catalytic efficiency in vitro while could still function as D-Ala-D-Ala ligase in vivo. By kinetic characterization of several mutants in the active region and crystal structure analysis of the enzyme, the structurally unique 310-helix was discovered to be probably partially responsible for this unusual low activity. Our current work on HpDdl is expected to provide useful information for the rational inhibitor design against this attractive antimicrobial drug target.
