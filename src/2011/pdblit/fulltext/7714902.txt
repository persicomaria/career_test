Human progastricsin, a zymogen of one of the gastric aspartic proteinases, was isolated and crystalolized. The crystals belong to the tetragonal space group P422t2, and have unit cell dimensions a = b -- 105.5 + 0.1 A, c -- 70.6 ~,. The native crystals of progastricsin diffract X-rays at least to 2.5 ~, and are suitable for a high-resolution X-ray analysis.

Progastricsin or pepsinogen C is a zymogen of gastricsin (EC 3.4.23.3) - one of the gastric aspartic proteinases found in stomachs of several species [1]. Progastricsin is also present in blood serum and seminal fluid [2,3]. Under acidic conditions progastricsin is converted autocatalytically into gastricsin. The zymogen has one polypeptide chain with molecular weight of 38000, stable in neutral solutions ( p H 6 - 8 ) [4]. The primary structures of both progastricsin c D N A [5] and the gene [6] have been established. The problem of the activation mechanism of this zymogen has been the subject of several publications [4,7,8]. In view of the growing interest in the activation of aspartic proteinases and their physiological role we have undertaken studies of the three-dimensional structure of progastricsin. A structural model of this zymogen has been built on the basis of the three-dimensional structure of pig pepsinogen with the use of computer graphics (Bank, R.A., personal communication). In this paper we describe purification, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic data of human progastricsin. High purity progastricsin was isolated from human stomachs by the following procedure. Stomachs were obtained during dissection no later than 3 h after death certification and kept at - 7 0 ° C before use. To initiate the purification the stomachs were thawed at room temperature. Mucosa was separated with scissors, homogenized with 4 vol. of 0.02 M Tris-HCl buffer ( p H 7.2) and centrifuged at 50 000 × g

309 and 4 ° C for 30 min. 1500 ml of supernatant were mixed with 200 ml of DEAE-cellulose DE-23 (Whatman) which had been pre-cycled according to the instructions of manufacturer and equilibrated with the homogenization buffer. The mixture was shaken for 1 h and then the ion-exchanger was washed on a glass filter with 0.02 M Tris-HC1 buffer (pH 7.0). The adsorbent was packed in a column and progastricsin was eluted together with pepsinogen and cathepsin E in 0.5 M NaCI. After dialysis against 0.02 M Tris-HC1 (pH 7.0) the zymogen peak was applied on a DEAE-cellulose DE-52 column (2.5 × 25 cm) and progastricsin was eluted with a gradient of 0-0.5 M NaCl in Tris-HC1 buffer (pH 7.0). Fractions containing the zymogen were identified in fused-rocket immunoelectrophoresis [9] with rabbit antiserum against human progastricsin. The main contaminant of the preparation, which was difficult to remove completely during the subsequent purl-

fication, was identified as serum albumin. In order to separate from the albumin the zymogen fractions were passed through Cibacron Blue F3GA-agarose (2.5 × 30 cm). Serum albumin was absorbed on the dye column while progastricsin passed through. After dialysis the final purification was achieved by FPLC on a Mono Q column in 0.02 M His-HC1 buffer (pH 5.7). Progastricsin was eluted in 0.2-0.25 M salt in 0-0.5 M NaC1 gradient. The zymogen was at least 98% pure in SDSPAGE (Fig. 1) as judged by scanning the gel in a Shimadzu scanning densitometer CS9000 at 650 nm, and immunologically homogeneous in crossed immunoelectrophoresis with antiserum to crude stomach extract. The preparation was used for raising antibodies in rabbits. The resulting antiserum was absolutely monospecific both in Western blot and crossed immunoelectrophoresis, thus confirming the high degree of protein purity. Crystallization of progastricsin was performed by vapour diffusion using a conventional hanging drop method. 30 mg per ml solution of freeze-dried protein in water was used for screening a variety of crystallization conditions. 10 #1 hanging drops containing 2 parts of protein solution and 1 part of reservoir solution were equilibrated against 1 ml of the trial reservoir solution at room temperature. The precipitants used in the initial crystallization trials were ammonium sulfate, lithium sulfate, sodium-potassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, poly(ethylene glycol) 6000 buffered over a range of pH stability of pro-

310 gastricsin (pH 6.0-8.0). Several tests were done in the presence of small amounts (3-5%) of additives such as ethanol, isopropanol, dioxane. Single crystals were first obtained at p H 6.5 with 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. They grew rapidly in one dimension up to 1.2 mm, but were very thin. Small needles and spherolytes appeared at p H 6.0-6.5 with lithium sulfate as precipitant. The best crystals suitable for X-ray structure analysis were obtained from sodium-potassium phosphate solutions. The optimal precipitating solution was found to be 1 M sodiumpotassium phosphate p H 6.0-6.5. Crystals appeared after 3 days and were parallelepiped-shaped with maxim u m dimensions: 0.5 × 0.5 x 0.5 m m (Fig. 2). Preliminary crystallographic data were obtained by precession photography using C u K radiation from a GX-13 rotating-anode generator. The space group and cell parameters were determined from 12 ° precession photographs (Fig. 3). It was found that the progastricsin crystals were tetragonal, space ~roup P422~,2, unit cell dimensions a = b = 105.5 + 0.1 A, c = 70.6 A. They appeared to be quite stable under X-rays (for at least 72 h) and diffracted beyond 2.5 ,A resolution. The volume of the unit cell was determined to be 786 087 ,~a. The space group contains eight asymmetric units in the cell. Assuming one 38 000 molecular weight molecule per asymmetric unit, the ratio of volume to molecular mass (V) was calculated to be 2.46 ,A3/dalton. This value lies within the normal range found for solvent contents of crystalline proteins [10].
