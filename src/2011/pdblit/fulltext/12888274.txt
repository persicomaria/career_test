The crystal structure of the Ca-loaded form of pike 410 parvalbumin (minor component from pike muscle belonging to the /3 phylogenetic series), with both its primary sites CD and EF occupied by Ca'+ ions and its third site occupied by an ammonium ion, as previously determined at 1.93 A resolution, has now been refined to a resolution of 1.65 A. The crystallization of this parvalbumin in different ionic environments has allowed three novel non-isomorphous crystalline forms to be obtained: (1) a first form, crystallized in the presence of a mixture of ammonium sulphate and manganese sulphate, for which all the cation binding sites in the protein are occupied by Mn*+; (2) a second form crystallized in the presence of MgSO* as the precipitating agent, only differs from the Ca/NH, form by the occupation of the third site by Mg*+, whereas the primary sites remain occupied by Ca*+; (3) a third form, also crystallized in the presence of MgSO,, corresponds to a well-defined molecular species with both the primary EF site and the third site occupied by Mg*+, whereas the primary CD site remains occupied by Ca * + . The corresponding molecular structures reported here have been determined at resolutions between 1.8 and 2.4 A. The crystal structures allows the structural modifications comparison of the different accompanying the substitution of the primary sites by cations differing significantly in their ionic radii (Ca *+ Mn*+, Mg*+) to be investigated in detail, and it also leads to a precise description of the third site in a typical /I parvalbumin. The substitution of Ca*+ by Mg*+ within the primary site EF is characterized by a "contraction" of the co-ordination sphere, with a decrease of the mean oxygen-metal distance by a value of 0.25 A and a decrease of the co-ordination number from 7 to 6, as a consequence of the loss of a bidentate ligand (GlulOl), which becomes a monodentate one. Such an adaptation of the co-ordination sphere around a cation of smaller size involves, among others, the transformation of the GlulOl side-chain from the stable gauche( +) form to the less stable gauche( -) form. The third site is clearly described as a satellite of the CD primary site, since both sites possess common protein ligands, such as Asp53 and Glu59. Furthermore, Asp61 appears as a specific ligand of the third site in the different environments investigated in this work. We finally discuss the relevance of the third site to parvalbumin phylogeny.

1. Introduction
Parvalbumins are acidic Ca*+ and Mg*+ binding proteins of low molecular weight (M, z 11,500), which are ubiquitous in vertebrates (Pechere, 1977). Initially recognized as a family of homologous proteins in the muscles of lower vertebrates (Pechere, 1968), where they are found in relatively high quantities, they were subsequently found, although in lesser amounts, in the muscles of higher vertebrates (Lehky et al., 1974), as well as in a variety of nonmuscle tissues (Berchtold et al., 1984; Kagi et aE., 1987) including endocrine glands (Endo et al., 1985), skin cells (MacManus et al., 1985) and specific neurons (Celio, 1986; Pfyffer et al., 1987; Kosaka et al., 1987). Although the function of parvalbumins in muscle is not yet understood, their concentration apparently correlates with relaxation speed in mammalian muscles, and it has been proposed that parvalbumin is directly involved in the relaxation process of fast muscles (Heizmann et al., 1982; Stuhlfauth et al., 1984; for a review, see Heizmann, parvalbumins might be 1984). Interestingly, involved in calcium homeostasis in normal and tumour cells (for a review, see Heizmann & Berchtold, 1987). On the basis of amino acid sequence data, parvalbumins have been recognized as a subfamily of the large superfamily of calcium-binding proteins, which includes, among others, troponin-C and calmodulin (Goodman & Pechere, 1977; Goodman et 1980; MacManus et al., al., 1979; Kretsinger, 1983a,b). The homologies observed at the level of the amino acid sequences are clearly apparent at the level of the tertiary structures. The crystal structure of the carp parvalbumin, isoform pZ = 4.25, was the first to afford a detailed description of the folding of a typical calciprotein, as well as of the interactions between the protein and the calcium ions bound to it (Kretsinger & Nockolds, 1973; Moews & Kretsinger, 1975). Other structural studies of parvalbumins from different species in the crystal form by X-ray diffraction (Wery et al., 1985; Declercq et al., 1988; Swain et al., 1989; Kumar et al., 1990) or by two-dimensional `H n.m.r. in solution (Padilla et al., 1988) clearly confirm the generality of the-folding of the polypeptide chain into six helical segments, labelled A to F, with the four latter adopting the characteristic "EF hand" conformation, i.e. a helix-loop-helix motif with both helices nearly perpendicular, as initially described by Kretsinger & Nockolds (1973), in contrast to both helices A and B, which adopt an antiparallel orientation. The primary cation binding sites are localized in the CD and EF loops. Recently, the determination of the tertiary structures of ealmodulin (Babu et al., 1988), troponin-C (Herzberg & James, 1985; Satyshur et al., 1988), intestinal calcium-binding protein (Szebenyi & Moffat, 1986) and oncomodulin (Ahmed et al., 1990) by X-ray crystallography has afforded a unified picture at the level of the tertiary folding of the socalled EF-hand calciproteins (Strynadka & James,

1989). Specifically, all of these proteins possess a double EF-hand motif, which appears to be a basic unit with a self-organization capacity structural (Shaw et al., 1990). Parvalbumins display a high affinity for Ca* + and a lesser one for Mg* + , the athnity constant for Ca*+ ions being three to four orders of magnitude larger than that for Mg *+ ions (Lehky et al., 1977; Pechere, 1977; Wnuk et al., 1982). Under physiological conditions, parvalbumins are experiencing a complex ionic environment with, among others, a Mg*+ concentration in the millimolar range, the Ca*+ coneentration varying between 10e7 and 10e5 M depending on the state of the muscle fibre (for a review, see Riiegg, 1989). Such a situation suggests that parvalbumins are likely to alternate between a Ca-loaded form and a Mg-loaded one during the contraction relaxation cycle, following an early proposal by Pechere et al. (1977). Studies with isolated parvalbumins in solution have clearly established that the protein undergoes conformational changes upon Ca*+/Mg*+ exchange (Cox et al., 1979; Haiech et al., 1979; Ribeiro et al., 1984), in line with the general dependence of the protein conformation upon ionic interactions as initially reported by Pare110 et al. (1974). However, as recently emphasized (Hutnik et al., 1990 and references quoted herein), our underchanges upon ion standing of such conformational binding is rather limited if one considers several contradictions that exist in the literature. Although the tertiary structure of parvalbumin has been investigated in the crystal with different cationic species besides Ca*+, i.e. Tb3+, Cd*+, occupying one or both of the CD and EF sites (Sowadski et al., 1978; Wery et al., 1985; Swain et al., 1989), no has crystal structure of Mg-loaded parvalbumin been described so far. It has been established on the basis of sequence data that the parvalbumin subfamily is further subdivided into two evolutionary distinct lineages, the u-lineage and the more acidic P-lineage (Goodman t Pechere, 1977; Goodman et al., 1979). Such a classification has been subsequently substantiated on a structural basis through the observation that /3 parvalbumins possess a third cation binding site (also named the secondary site to distinguish it from the 2 high-affinity primary sites CD and EF) with low affinity for and no selectivity among divalent cations, including Ca*+ and Mg*+ (Drakenberg et al., 1985 and references therein). It is only recently that the exact position of the third site of a j? parvalbumin has been clarified through the crystallographic study of pike 4.10 parvalbumin (Declercq et al., 1988), despite extensive investigations in solution by several physico-chemical approaches (Rhee et al., 1981; Cave et al., 1982; Drakenberg et al., 1985). However, the occupation of the third site by an ammonium ion, as previously reported (Declercq et al., 1988), prompted us to investigate the possibility of preparing crystals with the third site occupied by a cation with a higher electron density. We give here the description of four different

Ionic Interactions
crystal forms of pike pl 410 parvalbumin (minor component from pike muscle belonging to the fi lineage). The determination of these four crystal structures at high resolution allows a detailed comparison of the polypeptide chain organization, as sites, well as of the geometry of their cation-binding in different ionic environments. In order to label the four compounds unambiguously, we shall use throughout this paper the following nomenclature "PaXY.Z"t, in which X represents the cation present in the CD site, Y in the EF site and Z in the third site. The four structures investigated here correspond to the molecular species PaCa,.NH,, PaMn,.Mn. PaCa,.Mg and PaCaMg.Mg, respectively. It must be noted that the determination of the PaCa,.NH, crystal structure, which was previously reported at a resolution of 1.93 A (Declercq et al., 1988), has now been improved to a resolution of 1.65 A (1 A = 61 nm). Although parvalbumins appear to be only ancillary proteins in muscle contraction, as defined by Riiegg (1989), they offer the attraction of being suitable prototypes for our understanding of the structural and functional features associated with calcium binding, as well as Ca/Mg exchange, by the different EF-hand proteins.

and a RIGAKU RU-200 rotating anode X-ray generator, with monochromated CuKu radiation graphite (1= 1.54178 A). In the case of PaCaMg.Mg, a part of the data was collected using the synchrotron radiation at Laboratoire d'utilisation du (A= 1.427 A) Rayonnement Electromagnetique (L.U.R.E. Orsay, France) and film technique. Each cassette containing 3 films was exposed for a rotation of 2", at speeds between 250 and 750 s/deg. (c) Data reduction, &+ucture solution and refinement The diffractometer data were empirically corrected for absorption and crystal decay. In the case of film data, the oscillation photographs were evaluated by the programme OSC (Rossman, 1979; Schmid et al., 1981). The collected data were merged into unique sets of reflections by the programme PROTEIN (Steigeman, 1974). The refinements were carried out by alternating between visual examinations and restrained refinements, increasing gradually the resolution. The following programmes were used: ROTLSQ (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980) for rigid body refinements; PROLSQ (Hendrickson bz Konnert, 1980) and EREF (Jack BELevitt, 1978; Deisenhofer, 1981) for energy restrained refinements; FRODO (Jones, 1978) for visual examinations of 2FO- F, and F,- F, Fourier maps. The ion-ligand distances were not restrained during the refinements performed with PROLSQ. In EREF. all the ions were introduced as a "metal", using in all cases the same parameters for the metal--oxygen nonbonded energy term (En,, = 74,000 r- l2 - 1000 re6) so that the differences in ion-ligand distances are not due to different external constraints. As concerns the form factors. during the initial steps of refinement the Ca". Mn2+ and Mg `+ ions were all considered as Ca*+. The correct species was specified during the very last steps of refinement when it was possible to determine the nature of the ions on the basis of their co-ordination figure and co-ordination number, of the mean value of the ionligand distance, of their temperature factors, of their electron density and of the conditions of crystallization. The programme PLUTO (Motherwell dt Clegg, 1978) was used for illustrations. A summary of the crystal data, and of the collection and refinement conditions. is given in Table 1.

2. Materials and Methods
Both parvalbumin components from pike muscle, the major one (p1 = 5.0) and the minor one (pl = 4.10) were purified following the procedure of Pechere et al. (1971). Following the last step of the purification, the excess of piperazine buffer was removed by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-25 column and the minor component was recovered as a calcium loaded form in the absence of any other ionic species (exhaustive dialysis against deionized water). Bs previously described (Declercq et aE., 1988), the purity of the protein was assessed by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Contamination of pike 410 parvalbumin by the major component never exceeded 95% in our preparations. The calcium content of the protein was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry, thus affording a Calprotein molar ratio of about 23 to 25 (protein concentration measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometry assuming cz5a = 2300). The lyophilized powder was finally dissolved in deionized water at a given concentration (usually 10 mg/ml), thus affording a solution referred to in the text as the protein solution. (a) CrystalZization All the crystallization experiments used the hanging drop technique and were performed at 20 "C. The reservoir was filled with 5 ml of a 3 mM-sodium azide solution containing the appropriate precipitating agent. Unless otherwise noted, the hanging drop was formed by mixing 6 ~1 of the protein solution and 2 ~1 from the reservoir. (b) Data collection Most of the X-ray diffraction room temperature on a HUBER data were collected at 4-circle diffractometer

Diffractometer data have now been completed up to a resolution of 1.65 A. The previous results at 1.93 A resolution were used as a starting model for the refinement. The improvement of the electron density of the C-terminal residues allowed us to include the side-chain of LyslO7, which was missing in the previous model.

Ionic Interactions ion was described. To confirm this proposal, attempts were made to replace the ammonium ion of the secondary site by a manganese ion, which has been described as a specific probe of the secondary site (Cave et al., 1979a). Another advantage of this ion is that it could be easily displayed by the computation of a difference Fourier synthesis between the two data sets. Unfortunately, all the trials to transfer crystals of PaCa,.NH, (crystallized from ammonium sulphate) in solutions of ammonium sulphate containing small quantities of manganese sulphate were unsuccessful. The result was always a dislocation of the crystal, even in the presence of relatively low concentrations of Mn2+. On the other hand, a new crystal form (PaMn,.Mn) has been produced using as the precipitating agent 2 M-ammonium sulphate, 625 Mmanganese sulphate and ammonium hydroxide for adjusting pH to 7. After five days at room temperature, the concentration in the reservoir was increased to 2.2 M-(NH,),SO, and 9275 M-MnSC,. About five more days later, nice needles appeared in a number of preparations, with dimensions of around O-2 mm x O-3 mm x l*Omm. It is worth noting that compared to PaCa,.NH,, only the b axis has been substantially shortened by -2 A, causing a decrease of the volume of more than 4 %. This probably explains the instability of the crystals of PaCa,.NH, during the soaking experiments in the presence of manganese sulphate. Large differences also appeared between the intensities of the two compounds, suggesting a lack of isomorphism between the two structures. A complete data set of PaMn,.Mn was collected on the diffractometer. To check the lack of isomorphism, structure factors were computed for data between 10 and 4 A, using the co-ordinates of PaCa,.NH,. A value of R = O-60 confirmed that the exact location of Mn2+ could not be deduced from a simple difference Fourier map. Considering the similarities of the space groups and of the unit-cell dimensions, it was supposed that the disposition of the protein molecule should not be very different from that observed in PaCa,.NH,. This model was tentatively introduced in the refinement of the six rigid body parameters, limiting the data to 4 and later to 3 A. The final values according to the notations used in ROTLSQ are 0, = -3.3", 0, = 2.7", 0, = 2G3", TX = -0.16 A, T,, = -0.34 A, T, = -674 A and R = O-30. After this transformation, the co-ordinates corresponding to the ammonium ion in the starting model are so close to the 2-fold axis that it clearly becomes an impossible position, unless it is located exactly on this axis (60, 0.0; 24.6). At that stage, a difference Fourier synthesis between observed and calculated structure factors showed only one large electron density peak in the special position (00, @O,243), where the manganese ion has replaced the ammonium ion. This result in itself confirms the proposed location of the secondary site. At the same time it implies that a kind of dimer of protein molecules is constituted around the manganese ion in a special position. This could be related to the shortening of the b

axis, and for a complete understanding of this new feature, the refinement of PaMn,.Mn was undertaken. At the end of the refinement, the relatively high B value of the Mn2+ ion in the third site indicates that this site could be only partially occupied. Because of the high correlations between B and occupancy, the latter was not refined.

(c) Occupation of the primary PaMn,.Mn

sites by Mn2+ in

A proton relaxation enhancement (PRE) n.m.r. experiment was carried out with pike 4.10 parvalbumin with the aim of confirming that the primary sites of the protein are, indeed, occupied by Mn2+ ions under the conditions used for crystallizing the protein in the presence of MnSO,. As shown in Figure 1, the enhancement factor (a) observed with a solution of pike 410 PaCa, (protein concentration 91 mM) in the presence of three equivalents of Mn2+ progressively diminishes on addition of either Ca2+ or Mg'+, two cations which are known to compete with Mn2+ for the third site of fi parvalbumins (Cad et al., 1979a). However, both diamagnetic cations differ markedly by their effects on the T, relaxation properties of the solution. When Ca2 + is added, the enhancement factor diminishes according to an apparently monophasic curve

J.-P. Declercq et al. A second form of a Mg-loaded parvalbumin (PaCaMg.Mg) was obtained after exchanging in solution as much as possible of the Ca2+ present in the protein (solution diluted to 7.5 mg/ml) by Mg2+ using successive dialyses against 1.5 M-MgSO,, 3 m&r-NaN, and 65 M-MgSO,, 3 m&r-NaN,. At the end, the residual Ca2+ was checked by atomic absorption spectrometry: a concentration corresponding to 0.53 Ca atom per protein molecule was determined. A volume of 8 ~1 of this dialysed solution formed the hanging drop for crystallization experiments. The precipitating agent was initially 2 M-MgSO, and later raised to 2.4 M. Crystals appeared about one week later. They were characterized by the same tetragonal space group, but with slightly different cell dimensions as compared to those of PaCa,.Mg. By use of the diffractometer. data were collected to 2.3 A resolution (8051 measurements). Considering that this crystal structure could allow investigation of the structural modifications involved in the Ca-Mg exchange, it seemed desirable to achieve the highest possible resolution. For this reason, the data were completed to 18 A, using the synchrotron radiation and film technique. A rotation of 16" was collected from each of the five crystals used. The oscillation photographs provided 56,618 additional measurements. The two data sets'(PaCa,.Mg and PaCaMg.Mg) seemed to be more or less isomorphous, so only one of them (PaCa,.Mg) had to be submitted to the molecular replacement method. PaCa,NH, was used as a model and structure factors were computed in a large Pl unit cell (60, 50,50 A) to a resolution of 4 A. The fast rotation function of Crowther (1972) gave only one very large peak corresponding to c1= 85", /I = 28" and y = 80". At that stage the ambiguity between the space groups P4,2,2 and P4,2,2 was not yet solved and both possibilities had to be taken into account for the translation problem. To overcome this difficulty, only the symmetry elements common to both space groups were included in the first steps: three perpendicular non-intersecting 2-fold screw axes (in fact, P212,2, with origin translated). Limiting the data to 4 A, the T formula of Crowther & Blow (1967) maps correallowed us to compute translation sponding to the three planes perpendicular to the three 2-fold axes. A three-dimensional translation grid was then constructed: each grid point, representing a possible three-dimensional translation, was computed by summing the contribution of each map to that translation. At the end, the resulting values were sorted according to their magnitudes and the first one (which also appeared to be the correct one) was 1.44 times larger than the next one. The use of a 2-fold axis instead of a 4-fold axis dictates that points that were possible equivalent origins (0, 0,O and 3, 0,O) in the orthorhombic space group used up to now are no longer equivalent when coming back to the tetragonal system. The four possible combinations (2 space groups and 2 origins) were tested by applying to each of them 3 cycles of rigid body refinement against data between 8 and

until E = 1, when all MnZf ions are free in solution. In contrast, addition of Mg2+ is characterized by a biphasic curve. It appears that during Mg addition, a first competition occurs between Mn2+ and Mg2+ for the third site, whereas at higher Mg2+ concentration, a second competition process takes place between the added Mg2+ ions and the Mn2+ ions bound to the primary sites CD and/or EF. It must be noted that the intrinsic enhancement factors of the third site and the primary sites differ markedly, i.e. about 17 and 2.5, respectively, as previously under established with /I carp 4.25 parvalbumin similar conditions (Cave et al., 1979a). This explains why the first step during Mg addition in Figure 1 is characterized by the strongest E decrease, whereas the second step, which specifically involves the primary sites, does not represent more than 25% of the observed enhancement factor. As previously established by Lehky et ~2. (1977), displacement of calcium from a rabbit parvalbumin (with no 3rd site) is rather efficient in the presence of Mn'+, although the affinity of parvalbumin for the latter is, however, significantly lower than is found for Ca2+ ions. If one takes into account the fact that the affinity constant (primary sites) for Mg2+ is 35 orders of magnitude lower than that for Ca2+ (Lehky et al., 1977), it is expected that upon Ca addition, all the Mn2+ ions bound to pike 4.10 parvalbumin (primary and secondary sites) will be released concomitantly as a consequence of the high affinity of parvalbumin for Ca2+ ions, in agreement with the results of Figure 1 (see curve A). In contrast, upon Mg addition, it is the Mn2+ ions, bound to the lower affinity third site, that are first released, until the Mg concentration is sufficiently high for competition with the Mn2+ ions strongly bound to the primary sites of the protein, in agreement with the biphasic behaviour observed in Figure 1 (see curve B). The fact that E does not reach unity (free Mn'+), even at 1 M-Mg'+, simply translates the fact that the affinity constants of Mn2 + and Mg `+ for the primary sites of parvalbumin differ by as much as three orders of magnitude (as expected, when a small amount of the high-affinity cation La3 + was added at the end of the Mg titration, the E value reached unity: see Fig. 1).

(d) Structures of PaCa,.Mg

and PaCaMg.Mg

Since calciproteins are likely to vary from a Caloaded form to a Mg-loaded form under physiological conditions, we tried to crystallize our parvalbumin at different levels of Mg loading. A first form, which was later identified as PaCa,.Mg (Mg in the 3rd site only) was produced using 2&r-MgSO, as precipitant. No pH adjustment was necessary in this case. Three days later, the concentration of MgS04 in the reservoir was raised to 2.2 M and large crystals (0.5 to 1.0 mm) appeared within one day. Diffractometer data up to 2.4 A were collected.

A summary of the results of the refinements is given in Table 1. They include the agreement among observed and calculated structure factors as a function of resolution. The deviations of the stereochemical parameters from ideality are indicated, and in the case of refinement by PROLSQ, the corresponding input standard deviations are given. The average co-ordinate error has been estimated by means of a Luzzati (1952) plot. Since this technique assumes that the disagreement between F, and F, is essentially due to errors in co-ordinates, the result can be considered as an upper limit and the actual values of the mean co-ordinate errors should be less than indicated. As discussed in the next section, the folding of the parvalbumin molecule in the four structures is very similar. As a consequence, the Ramachandran plots are also similar so that only one of them (PaCaMg.Mg), presented in Figure 2, illustrates the quality of the refined structures. The distribution of x1 torsion angles of the side-chains in the four molecules together are shown by the histogram in Figure 3. The expected trimodal distribution with the largest peak at -60" and two other peaks at 180" and 60" is observed. The variation of the temperature factors along the polypeptide chain of parvalbumin is shown in Figure 4 for the four structures. The highest values appear for the

terminal residues and the lowest ones in the regions of the cation binding loops. As indicated in Table 1, a few atoms that could not be localized in the electron density were not included in the refinement. (f) Chemical
nature of the bound ions

The assignment of the chemical nature of the bounds ions is the result of a number of concordant indications. None of these indications constitutes a positive proof in itself, but all of them concur to a coherent conclusion. These different arguments are discussed in the appropriate sections and are summarized here: (1) the relative salt concentrations during the crystallization; (2) the atomic absorption and PRE data; (3) the co-ordination numbers and polyhedra; (4) the cation-oxygen distances compared to the mean values observed in

small molecules; (5) the previous n.m.r. results on Mn and Mg-loaded parvalbumins (Cave et al., 1979a,b, 1982); (6) for the third site of PaMn,.Mn, the difference Fourier synthesis indicating one large electron density peak; (7) the B values of the cations (Table 1). The co-ordinates of the four structures have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977). The identification codes are 1PAL for PaCa, .NH, , 2PAL for PaMn,.Mn, 3PAL for PaCa,.Mg and 4PAL for PaCaMg.Mg. 4. Discussion

Results of the least-squares fit of the c" atoms of residues 6 to 106 in the 4 determinations of pike 410 Pa and a high resolution study of carp 425 Pa (Swain et al., 1989). The upper part of the Table gives the r.m.s. deviation (A) between C" atoms. The lower part gives the largest deviation (A) and the residue number where it occurs. From the estimated errors on the atomic positions (Table l), one can estimate that the errors associated with these deviations are lying between 025 and 0.30 11.

least-squares tit of the co-ordinates of the a carbon atoms of residues 6 to 106 was computed for all the couples of available structures, as presented in Table 2. The comparison was limited to this range of residues because in pike 4.10 Pa, a deletion occurs at position 5; in addition, as explained above in Results, the C-terminal residues of some of our structures are not well defined in the electron density. For carp 4.25 PaCa,, the co-ordinates were kindly provided by R. H. Kretsinger. The observed differences are generally small and two conclusions can be drawn from this comparison. (1) The ionic substitution does not involve large modifications in the general folding of the protein, but only local changes as will be explained below. (2) The main characteristics of carp 425 Pa described by Kretsinger & Nockolds (1973) are conserved: the six helices labelled A to F and ion binding in the CD and EF loops, as well as a characteristic contact between both loops through hydrogen bonding within a short antiparallel b-sheet unit. A list of intra-main-chain hydrogen bonds is given in Table 3. Whereas the cation in the CD site (Ca'+, Mn2+ ) is fully dehydrated, this is not the case for the cation bound to the EF site 1 (Ca 2+ Mn2+, Mg2+), which is l'g anded by a water moleclle. A more detailed description of the protein hydration is given below. The bending of helix D at (4, cc/) values of (-97, 18), residue 65, with (-90, 25), (-111, 18), (-104, 15) in the four structures, respectively, instead of ( -64, -4O), is usually accepted as a regular c1helix. These values should be compared to those observed in carp PaCa,: (-92, 12) (Swain et aE., 1989) and (-96, 14) (Kumar et al., 1990). The salt bridge between Arg75 and Glu81 and the short P-sheet between two residues, Ile58 and Ile97, belong to each of the primary cation binding sites. These four residues are conserved in parvalbumins. The geometries of both these elements in the four structures are described in Table 4. The hydrophobic internal core is also conserved. In our four structures, the phenylalanine residue in

position 2 is clearly orientated towards the internal part of the molecule: the distance from the centre of mass of the molecule is about 12.5 L%for PheS-C', while it is only 9 A for the centre of the aromatic ring. As was explained earlier, the absence of residue 5 in pike 410 Pa does not allow a direct comparison of this part of the molecule with carp 4.25 Pa, but it is worth noting that in carp 4.25 PaCa,, Phe2 was described as being internal by Swain et al. (1989) and as lying on the surface by Kumar et al. (1990). Among the amino acid substitutions between pike 4.10 Pa and carp 4.25 Pa, Ala72 (carp) is Pro72 in pike 410 (Gerday, 1976). The occurrence of a proline residue is rather unique among parvalbumins of the fi phylogenetic series (Goodman & PechBre, 1977). However, Ala72 in carp has been described with a @ angle of -53", which is not too different from the value usually observed in a proline residue, about -6O", imposed by the closure of the five-membered ring. In our four structures of pike 4.10 Pa, Q, angle values of - 48", -47", -53" and - 61" are obtained for Pro72 and explain the similitude of the molecules in that region. About 20% of the residues correspond to a local as found in P-sheet extended conformation However, as mentioned secondary structures. above, only a very restricted number of residues, i.e. residues at positions 57 and 96, are involved in the formation of a P-sheet structure in parvalbumins. The case of the conformationally extended residue 25 is interesting in the sense that it lies at the boundary of the AB loop and the B helix. It' is observed in the crystal structures investigated here that the amide NH at position 25 comes in close proximity to the Phe24 aromatic ring. In agreement with such a mutual positioning of both structural elements, it was observed that the NH25 in pike 5-O PaCa, in solution displays an unusually high-field shifted NH resonance in the `H n.m.r. spectrum (Padilla et aZ., 1988). This is a unique resonance to be displaced to such a high-field position and is accounted for by the proximity between NH25 and the aromatic ring of Phe24 in the solution structure

of this a parvalbumin. Since Phe24 is an invariant residue in the primary structures of parvalbumins (Protein sequence data bank, 1990), it is likely that the turn preceding the entry to the B helix involves such an NH/Phe (aromatic) contact, as a structural element in parvalbumin folding, owing to the fact that such a proximity is observed in solution and in the crystal for a and /? parvalbumins. (kj) The third cation binding site

One important result of the comparison of the four crystal structures is the unambiguous identificabion of the third cation binding site as a satellite of the CD site. In the past, the occurrence of a third

site was first inferred by Nelson et al. (1977) from measurements on terbium-loaded fluorescence parvalbumin. However, from the crystallographic study of the replacement of calcium by terbium in carp parvalbumin, Sowadski et al. (1978) had suspicions about the existence of this site. It was then demonstrated to be present only in /l parvalbumins by n.m.r. studies (Cave et al., 1979a, 1982). These authors concluded that the third site should be a satellite of the primary EF site, with a high degree of hydration. Using laser excitation spectroscopy, Rhee et al. (1981) also recognized the occurrence of this third binding site, but described it in the proximity of the CD site, sharing the carboxylic groups of residues 53, 59 and 62 with the CD site (one oxygen

of each carboxylate binds the primary site and the other one the secondary site). In addition, one oxygen atom of the side-chain of Asp61 not involved in the co-ordination of the primary site was bound to the secondary site. Their interpretation was partly based on the inspection of the three-dimensional structure revealing a favourable position for the co-ordination of a Ln3+ ion. After a reassignment of the il%d n.m.r. signals of carp 425 PaCd,, Drakenberg et al. (1985) agreed with the proximity to the CD site. In the present studies, the third binding site is occupied either by an ammonium ion (PaCa,.NH,), by a manganese ion (PaMn,.Mn) or by a magnesium ion (PaCa,.Mg and PaCaMg.Mg). The geometries of the third site in these different structures are summarized in Table 5. In the first case (PaCa,.NH,), the ammonium ion forms bonds with the carboxylates of Asp53, Glu59 and Asp61. Contrary to the model of Rhee et al. (1981), Glu62 is not at all involved, Glu59 shares the same oxygen atom as the CD site and both oxygen atoms of Asp61 are bound. The co-ordination is completed by three water molecules. All the distances are in a range acceptable for hydrogen bonds. In PaMnz.Mn, the manganese ion is located on a crystallographic 2-fold axis. Its direct neighbourhood is constituted by four (2 independent) water molecules in a nearly tetrahedral arrangement. These water molecules form, in turn, hydrogen bonds with exactly the same protein ligands as in PaCa2.NH,. Through this hydrated ion, a dimer of parvalbumin molecules is formed. Figure 5 shows the co-ordination of the CD site, the manganese ion and a part of the symmetry-related CD site. A comparable view of the CD site of PaCa,.NH, in the same orientation was given by Declercq et al. (1988). A tetrahedral co-ordination is rather unusual around Mn2+ , but exists for example in MnSO, (Pistorius, 1960). In both Mg' + -loaded derivatives, the third site is occupied by a Mg2+ ion in a nearly perfect octahedral arrangement. One apex is occupied by Asp53 0". while 0" of the same residue is, as usual.

Glu62 and some symmetryrelated atoms are also involved in the surrounding of these water molecules, but such features are not common to our four examples of co-ordination of the third site.

Figure 6. The octahedral co-ordination of the 3rd binding site in PaCaMg.Mg and the corresponding density (map coefficients are 2F,,- F, and contouring level is @5e A3). satellite site is observed, one must remember that the cation primary binding sites (CD and EF) of parvalbumins have been described as EF hands with very similar conformations (Kretsinger & 1973; Moews & Kretsinger, 1975), Nockolds, including a loop of 12 amino acids. In this loop, the residues in the relative positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12 are directly involved in the binding of the cation (position 9 is replaced by a water molecule in the EF site). Tt seems very probable that three characteristics present in the surrounding of the CD site of j? parvalbumins are essential to create the existence of the third binding site as a satellite of this CD site: (1) Asp in position 3 (Asp53) contributes by one of its carboxylate oxygens, while the other one is bound to the CD site. (2) Glu in position 9 (Glu59) sharing one carboxylate oxygen between the two binding sites (with eventually an intermediate water molecule between this oxygen and the 3rd site). (3) Asp in position 11, not at all involved in the binding of the primary site. When the third cation binding site is present, the side-chain of Asp in relative position 11 is very clearly oriented to the interior of the loop formed by residues 1 to 12. On the other hand, in the EF site of pike 410 parvalbumin, (1) is satisfied, (2) is completely unsatisfied (relative position 9 is Gly) and (3) could be satisfied, the relative position 11 being Asp. As can be expected, the satellite site does not exist and it is worth noting that the side-chain of Asp100 (relative position 11) is oriented to the outside of the loop in our four structures. Figure 7 compares the CD and the EF sites in PaCaMg.Mg. The difference of conformation between Asp61 and Asp100 is mainly due to a modification of the angle x1 from gauche( - ) to gauche( + ): the four individual values are 65", 77", 74", 68' and -59", -62", -72", - 72", respectively. The values of all the other conformational angles of these two residues are quite comparable. The absence of any carboxylate group at position 9 of the EF site (instead, a water molecule co-ordinates the protein-bound cation) is likely to be the main reason why no EF satellite site is observed in the parvalbumins investigated so far. Since the occurrence or the absence of the third site has been used as a criterion for distinguishing j3 from c1 parvalbumins, respectively, by n.m.r. methods in solution (Cave et al., 1979a, 1981, 1982), it is interesting to discuss the relevance of such a criterion in the light of the structural features established here by X-ray crystallography. All /l parvalbumins examined at that time in solution by n.m.r. possessed an Asp residue at position 61, whereas a Glu residue was present in all the a parvalbumins. Since Asp61 appears to be a crucial residue in the organization of the third site (relative position 11 within the CD loop), it is necessary to understand why the substitution at position 61 of Asp by Glu, two closely related residues, is apparently responsible for the disappearance of the third site, as initially concluded with typical a parvalbumins (Cave et al., 1982). One answer would be that the distance between both cations, bound to the primary CD site and to the third site, respectively, is highly constrained as a consequence of the fact that both sites share common ligands, and these (Asp53, Glu59) are invariant in all structures a or fl. As shown in Table 5, the distance between both cations lies between 50 and 5% A when the divalent cations Mg2+ and Mn2+ bind to the third site. A similar value of 5 A was measured in solution by r13Cd n.m.r. for the Mn-Cd distance in carp 4.25 PaCd,.Mn (Cave et aE., 1982). It therefore appears

In the first case, the side-chain of Asp61 points to the inside of the loop to accommodate the 3rd cation. In the latter case, Asp100 is oriented towards the outside.

that it is the ligand at position 61 that is forced to adapt its conformation (i.e. the less stable gauche( -) rotamer) in order to co-ordinate the cation in the third site. In this respect, one can speculate that Glu, with its longer side-chain, would be less adapted. Since the publication of the work by Goodman et al. (1979), about ten additional amino acid sequences have now been reported (Protein sequence data bank, 1990), and it appears that parvalbumins classified in the a series can display Asp61 instead of Glu61, and some /? parvalbumins can display Glu61 instead of Asp61. Obviously, the distinction between a and fl .parvalbumins on the basis of the occurrence or the absence of the satellite CD site might no longer be of general validity. However, caution must be exerted since the amino acid sequences of parvalbumins are not devoid of mistakes as recently reported (Padilla et al., 1990; M. Chiadmi, personal communication). It was hypothesized that the third site, being a satellite site of a primary site (Cave et al., 1979a), could act as a relay for translocating a fully hydrated cation (aquocation) to the highly dehydrated primary site via an intermediate site with partial dehydration of the aquocation. As suggested by the co-ordination features of the third site in the crystal structures PaCa,.Mg and PaCaMg.Mg (see Table 5), it is likely that in solution Mg2+ will lose at least one water molecule upon binding to the third site in comparison with the corresponding aquo-cation with its six surrounding water molecules. Whatever the validity of the hypothesis mentioned above, it is likely that hybrid species,

among others, such as PaCa,.Mg and PaCaMg.Mg exist, at least for parvalbumins containing Asp61, under physiological conditions where Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions are present at different concentrations (see Riiegg, 1989). Interestingly, in all amino acid sequences of parvalbumins known so far, the position 61 corresponds without exception to the presence of an acidic residue, i.e. Asp or Glu, and this might be related to a general mechanism of cation capture and/or release by the CD sites of parvalbumins. The structural interdependence between the CD primary site and its satellite or third site is well illustrated in solution by the observation that the position of the `13Cd2+ (CD) resonance (i.e. the resonance representing the Cd'+ ion bound to the CD site according to Drakenberg et al., 1985) on the `13Cd n.m.r. spectrum of a cadmium-loaded parvalbumin PaCd, is selectively shifted upon binding of an additional cation to the third site. It is interesting to emphasize here that monovalent cations, in&din NH:, have an effect (downfield shift) on the l1 8Cd'+(CD) resonance opposite to that of divalent cations (upfield shift) (Cav8 et al., 1982). In relation to this observation in solution, the co-ordinations of NH: and Mg2+ in the third site are different in the crystal structures (Table 5). (c) The primary binding sites (CD and EF)

The co-ordination of the two primary cation binding sites is described in Table 6. Of the eight coordination spheres described, five present seven

neighbours at distances less than 3.0 L%and three of them present only six neighbours. Although the first description of Carp 4'25 P&a, (Kretsinger & Nockolds, 1973; Moews & Kretsinger, 1975) described six and eight oxygen atoms in the coordination of the calcium ions, it is actually well established that Ca2+ ions are normally surrounded by seven atoms in parvalbumins and other Ca-binding proteins (Declercq et al., 1988; Strynadka & James, 1989; Swain et al., 1989; &mar et aZ., 1990). In the case of seven neighbours, the two oxygen atoms of the carboxylates belonging to Gluf32 or GlulOl (relative position 12), act as bidentate ligands and such an arrangement is best described as a pentagonal bipyramid (Strynadka & James, 1989). The co-ordination figure of the sixco-ordinated ions more closely resembles a regular octahedron. It is also noteworthy that the mean values of the distances around the sevenco-ordinated ions are substantially longer ( 2 2.33 A) than those around the six-co-ordinated ions (12.22 A). The decrease of the co-ordination number seems to be coherent with a smaller ionic radius. For comparison, the mean values of the Ca2+. . . 0, Mn2+ . . 0 and Mg2+. . , 0 distances in the crystal structures of small organic molecules and were searched by means of the complexes Cambridge Crystallographic Data Base (Allen et ab., 1983). We obtain 2.34(2) Bi, 2+21(l) A and 2*07(l) 8, respectively. These values suggest that the sevenco-ordinated sites in parvalbumins are all occupied by Ca2+ ions, while the other ones have been substituted by smaller ions. Therefore, in PaMn2.Mn,

both the CD and the EF sites should be occupied by Mn2+ ions, while in PaCaMg.Mg, only the EF site has been loaded by a Mg2+ ion. Under the conditions used for crystallizing pike 4.10 parvalbumin in the presence of MnSOL, the molar ratio Mn/Ca was kept as high as 40, so that occupation of both the primary sites CD and EF, as well as of the third site, by Mn2+ would be nearly complete, in agreement with our PRE n.m.r. results (see Fig. 1). In the case of Ca2+/Mg2+ substitution, a much smaller ion must be accommodated and this seems to be more difficult to realize: [Mg'+]/[Ca'+] ratios were about 300 and 1500 during the crystallization of PaCa2.Mg and PaCaMg.Mg, respectively, and only the EF site was substituted using the highest concentration ratio. It is not surprising that the substitution of the Ca'+ ion of the EF site occurs before that of the CD site since their affinities for calcium differ by two orders of magnitude in pike 410 parvalbumin (Eberspach et al., 1988). During the transformation from a sevenfold co-ordination to a sixfold co-ordination, the carboxylate of Glu at relative position 12 is mainly involved since it becomes a monodentate ligand instead of a bidentate one. The conformational angles of these residues are compared in Table 7. Again, it appears that Mn2+ ions can replace Ca2+ ions with only a minimum of modifications: the largest difference is about 50" for x3 of GlulOl. On the other hand, Mg2+ ions can only be accommodated in the EF site after a complete rearrangement of the side-chain of GlulOl from gauche( +) to gauche( -): x1 is now

+62" instead of about -70" in all the other cases. the occupancy of both sites CD and EF by Mn2+ ions preserve the gauche( + ) conformation of GlulOl as well as Glu62 with minimum adaptation (see Table 7) in agreement with the fact that the ionic radius of Mn2+ has a value intermediate between those of Ca2 + and Mg2 + . Figure 8 compares the EF sites in PaCa,.NH, and PaCaMg.Mg. It shows clearly the different orientations of the sidechain of GlulOl.

In contrast,

Ca2+/Mg2+ substitution, Strynadka & James (1989) correctly predicted the change from seven- to sixco-ordination, accomplished by modifications in the side-chain torsion angles of the glutamate at position 12, that change it from a bidentate to a monodentate ligand. They expected changes principally in the torsional angles x2 and x3, while in the present study, x1 appears to be the most affected. The compactness of the whole molecule is also affected by the ionic contents of the CD and EF sites. This compactness can be evaluated by the distance between the cations present in the two sites. In PaCa,.NH, and PaCa,.Mg, both sites are

J.-P. Declercq et al. parvalbumin (carp 425 with 2 primary sites and a secondary site), Cave et al. (19796) observed that the signal of 2sMg2 + experiences a moderate broadening upon binding to the primary sites of parvalbumin, whereas a larger broadening is observed in the case of the secondary site. As shown in Tables 5 and 6, both types of Mg sites, i.e. the primary EF site of PaCaMg.Mg and the secondary site of PaCa,.Mg and PaCaMg.Mg, differ markedly by the number of their charged oxygen atoms. In the primary EF site, four of the six oxygen atoms in the octahedral coordination sphere (along the X, Y, Z and -Z directions) belong to charged carboxylate groups, whereas the remaining two oxygen atoms belong to dipolar groups (along the -X and - Y directions). In contrast, the secondary site (or 3rd site) has only one of the directions of the octahedron occupied by a charged oxygen (from Asp53), whereas the other five directions are occupied by dipolar oxygens (water molecules). In agreement with the experimental observations by 2sMg n.m.r. (CavB et al., 19796), the electric field gradient at the level of the bound Mg2+ cation is expected to be larger in the third site than in the primary site where mutual compensations between electric dipoles and monopoles will occur. Obviously, such a qualitative statement needs to be substantiated by further experimental studies (2sMg n.m.r., EXAFS using the Mn-loaded parvalbumin), as well as theoretical studies, with the aim of having a better understanding of the electronic properties of the cationbinding sites in parvalbumin. Clearly, our highresolution crystallographic results reported here with four distinct ionic forms of the same parvalbumin molecule afford the appropriate geometrical framework for an investigation to be carried out. (d) Solvent structure The solvent structure in the asymmetric part of the unit cell includes a total of 64 (PaCa,NH,), 62 (PaMn,.Mn), 95 (PaCa,.Mg) and 88 (PaCaMg.Mg) water molecules. All these water molecules are

PaMn,.Mn and PaCaMg.Mg (the error in the radius of gyration can be estimated to be less than 0.01 A from the mean atomic co-ordinate error). Although our initial plans were to prepare the fully Mg-loaded form PaMg,.Mg, the partially Mgloaded form PaCaMg.Mg is likely to be relevant to the situation encountered under physiological conditions, if one considers that both primary sites CD and EF in pike 410 parvalbumin differ significantly (by about 2 orders of magnitude) in their respective affinities for Ca2+ ions (Eberspach et al., 1988). Our work therefore affords the first comparison between the fully Ca-loaded form and a half Mg-loaded form of a typical EF-hand protein at the atomic level. Interestingly, the Mn-loaded form, PaMn,.Mn, which was initially planned to have the third site occupied with a high-electron-density element, has also both its primary sites CD and EF occupied by Mn2+ ions, a situation that affords the possibility of evaluating the effects on parvalbumin conformation of the binding of a divalent cation with an ionic radius intermediary between the ionic radii of Ca2+ and Mg2+ At this point of the discussion it appears appropriate to consider the differences in the coordination of Mg2+ in the EF primary site (PaCaMg.Mg form) and in the secondary site (PaCa,.Mg and PaCaMg.Mg forms) in relation to previous observations concerning the binding of Mg 2+ to parvalbumin in solution, as monitored by *`Mg n.m.r. (Cav6 et al., 19793). It is well established that a quadrupolar nucleus, such as "Mg (spin Z = 5/2), is highly sensitive to any variation of its electrical environment (for a comprehensive review of the relaxation properties of a quadrupolar nucleus in the presence of an electric field gradient, see Lindman & For&n, 1976). Upon binding to parvalbumin, Mg2 + goes from the highly symmetrical environment (very low field gradient) encountered in the aquo-cation (octahedral coordination by 6 water molecules) .to a less symmetrical environment in the protein-bound state (higher field gradients). In the case of a typical /?

ordered, being either involved in a number of hydrogen bonds or being co-ordinated to a Ca' +, a Mg2+ or a Mn2+ cation. Although the number of molecules inferred from our crystallographic studies differs from one molecular species to the other, it is likely that the hydration features of all four species remain essentially the same. However, local changes in hydration are not unexpected, especially around the cation binding sites, when a given cation is replaced by another one. The hydration around the EF site markedly differs upon its occupation by Ca or Mn or Mg. Whereas in PaCa,.NH,, PaMn,.Mn and PaCa,.Mg, the EF site essentially includes a single water molecule (H,0(246), see Table 6) as a direct ligand of the bound cation, this is not the case of the EF site in PaCaMg.Mg, for which several water molecules participate in the organization of the site (see Fig. 10). An interesting observation is related to the immediate hydration of the polar head of the GlulOl side-chain in PaCaMg.Mg. A water molecule, H,0(281), is at hydrogen bonding distance to GlulOl OE2 and this is not apparently the case in the other structures. Furthermore, this water molecule is part of a network of hydrogen bonds including H,0(242), which bridges intramolecularly Asp92 0". Among the hydrating water molecules, two seem

particularly interesting in the sense that they lie somewhat inside the protein: H,O(217) and H,O(241); both are very well defined in the electron density maps in all the four structures and their hydrogen bonding pattern is conserved. H,0(217) is bonded to Ile50 0, Gln52 OE1, Glu62 0 and Asn69 OJ1, while H,0(241) is bonded to Lys64 0, Phe66 N, Leu67 N and Arg75 0. The latter appears particularly relevant to the folding of the protein in the sense that it links through a network of H bonds the D helix to the DE loop, which includes the Arg75Glu81 salt bridge (see Fig. 11). Since H,O(241) bridges elements on each side of residue 65 (see above), it might be that this water molecule is involved in the kinking of helix D, as recently proposed for carp 4.25 parvalbumin in the crystal state (Swain et al., 1989). The occurrence of the salt bridge between both invariant residues Arg75-Glu81 is a remarkable feature of the folding of all parvalbumins for which detailed tridimensional structures have been determined so far. Our study with pike 4.10 parvalbumin confirms such a conclusion. The stability of this bridge is likely to be related to the presence of a highly structured network of hydrogen bonds originating from separate parts of the polypeptide chain (i.e. the AB and the CD loops). Tt is remarkable to

note that apparently no water molecule is involved in any of the hydrogen bonds observed around the salt bridge, as shown in Figure 12 and Table 4. (e) Packing in the four structures The four structures range between two packing modes. The structures of PaCa,.NH, and PaMn,.Mn forms are both P2,2,2 with the same general features of their packing arrangement. The two Mg-loaded forms PaCa,.Mg and PaCaMg.Mg are both tetragonal P4,2,2 and they both present a less tight packing. The volumes per asymmetric unit of PaCa,.NH, and PaMn,.Mn are similar to that observed for the other known parvalbumin structures, i.e. between 22,200 and 24,500 A3 (Table 8). Unexpectedly, the crystal organization in the two Mg-loaded forms results in very loose packed structures with a volume per asymmetric unit of -36,500 A3 and volume to mass ratio of 3.19 and 306 A3/Da, respectively. In the two orthorhombic crystal structures (PaCa,.NH, and PaMn,.Mn) the protein molecules are arranged as sheets extending in the XZ plane. As the c axis length is of the same order as the molecule dimension (26 A), the molecules are simply translated in the Z direction. The secondary site is located at the edge of the molecule in front of the solvent region between the sheets. It is thus very accessible for all cations. A symmetry-related secondary site of the next leaf is located just over the first one, In the case of PaMn,.Mn, the manganese ion occupies a special position on a crystallographic 2-fold axis. This is the reason for the observed contraction by 4% of the b axis perpendicular to the sheets as compared to PaCa,.NH,. Through this hydrated Mn2+ ion, a dimeric assembly of parvalbumin molecules is formed. No such molecular aggregation has been reported so far for the proteins of the EF-hand family. However, in the structure of oncomodulin, which belongs to this family, a Ca2+ ion interlinks several protein molecules into zigzag layers, resulting also in an extensive molecular aggregation (Ahmed et al., 1990). Concerning the contacts within the sheets, the hydroxyl of residue Tyr48 is hydrogen-bonded to two water molecules, H,0(204) and H,0(240), which in turn are relays, directly or by one of two other water molecules, to the A helix (contacts with

Ala12, LeulS), the AB loop (Cysl8, SerlS), and the salt bridge region (Ser71, Ser73, Arg75) of a symmetry-translated molecule. Moreover, there are three other direct contacts between these two related symmetry molecules: Asp100 06'-Ser73 07; Ser73 0-Lys44 N' and Ala1 3 N-Ser55 0. In the two Mg-loaded structures PaCa,.Mg and PaCaMg.Mg, the molecules are arranged so that large solvent channels are observed; this results in a very loose packing. The intermolecular contacts differ from the two preceding structures essentially in the secondary site region. Now the secondary CD satellite site is close to a symmetry-related EF site. The distances between the Mg2+ of the secondary site and the cation bound to the EF site on a symmetry-related molecule are, respectively: Mg2+...Ca2+=8*76A * PaCa, .Mg and Mg'+. . .Mg `+ = 8.99 A in I&JaMg.Mg. It should be observed that residue Tyr48 is involved in exactly the same contacts as in the two orthorhombic structures, i.e. two water molecules connected to the A helix, the AB loop and the salt bridge region. Also, the direct contacts between AsplOO-Ser73 and Lys44-Ser73 are conserved.

5. Conclusion
The present crystallographic analysis of four distinct molecular species of pike 410 parvalbumin provides a clear description of the exact nature and extent of the conformational events associated with ion exchange in a typical EF-hand calciprotein. The substitution of Ca2+ by Mg2+ within the primary site EF is characterized by a contraction of the co-ordination sphere, with a decrease of the mean oxygen-metal distance by a value of 623 A and a decrease of the co-ordination number from seven to six, as a consequence of the loss of a bidentate ligand (GlulOl), which becomes a monodentate one. This transformation is made possible by a complete rearrangement of the side-chain of GlulOl. In this respect, the side-chain undergoes a change from the more stable rotamer gauche( + ) to the less stable one gauche( -) through rotation about the C-C? bond (x1) by about 130"; similarly, a rearrangement occurs at the level of the carboxylate polar head through a significant variation of the x3 torsional angle, while x2 remains practically unchanged. The recognition of the existence of this

Ionic Interactions half Mg-loaded form is important in relation to the assumed exchange of Ca*+ and Mg*+ ions mediated by parvalbumins under physiological conditions. In the absence of any information concerning the substitution of Ca*+ by Mg*+ in the CD primary site, the molecular species PaMn,.Mn provides an insight into the conformational aspects to be expected upon substitution of Ca*+ by a small-sized divalent cation, such as Mn*+ in place of Mg2+. A decrease of the co-ordination number from seven to six is also observed in the crystal structure of PaMn,.Mn, for both primary sites in this case, as well as a decrease of the mean oxygen-metal distance. This is the consequence of the transformation of both residues in relative position 12 of the binding loops (Glu62 and GlulOl, respectively) from bidentate to monodentate ligands. It is likely that the substitution of Ca*+ by Mg*+ within the primary CD site is accompanied by a similar contraction of the co-ordination sphere. In the present case, where Ca*+ is substituted by Mn*+, the conformational changes of the side-chain of the residues in relative position 12 are much more subtle than in the case of a substitution by Mg*+, in agreement with the fact that the ionic radius of Mn*+ is intermediate between those of Ca*+ and Mg*+. Finally, our crystallographic study affords an unambiguous positioning of the third cation binding site of a typical j? parvalbumin. This third site can be described as a satellite of the CD primary site, in the sense that the two sites possess common protein ligands such as Asp53 and Glu59. Furthermore, Asp61 appears as a specific ligand of cations bound to the third site. In the case of hydrated ions, water molecules may be interposed between the cation and the carboxylic group of the protein ligand. This third cation binding site contributes significantly to the stabilization of the crystal forms, as it takes part in intermolecular contacts, which differ significantly. according to the occupation of the site by Mg2f or by another ion.
