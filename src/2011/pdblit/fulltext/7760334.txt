The cytochrome b reductase fragment of Neurospora crassa NADPH:nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.3) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli with a His-tag for purification after mutation of the NADPH binding site. The recombinant enzyme fragment was altered by site-directed mutagenesis guided by the three-dimensional structure of cytochrome b reductase fragment of corn NADH:nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.1). Substitution of Asp for Ser920 (using residue numbering for holoNADPH:nitrate reductase of N. crassa) greatly increased preference for NADH. This mutant had nearly the same NADH:ferricyanide reductase kcat as wildtype with NADPH. Substitutions for Arg921 had little influence on coenzyme specificity, while substitution of Ser or Gln for Arg932 did. The cytochrome b reductase mutant with greatest preference for NADH over NADPH was the doubly substituted form, Asp for Ser920/Ser for Arg932, but it had low activity and low affinity for coenzymes, which indicated a general loss of specificity in the binding site. Steady-state kinetic constants were determined for wild type and mutants with NADPH and NADH. Wild type had a specificity ratio of 1100, which was defined as the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for NADPH divided by catalytic efficiency for NADH, while Asp for Ser920 mutant had a ratio of 0.17. Thus, the specificity ratio was reversed by over 6000-fold by a single mutation. Preference for

NADPH versus NADH is strongly influenced by presence/absence of a negatively charged amino acid side chain in the binding site for the 2 phosphate of NADPH in nitrate reductase, which may partially account for existence of bispecific NAD(P)H:nitrate reductases (EC 1.6.6.2). © 1998 Academic Press Key Words: cytochrome b reductase fragment; NADPHnitrate reductase; Neurospora crassa; coenzyme specificity; site-directed mutagenesis.

Eukaryotic nitrate reductase (NR; EC 1.6.6.1-3)5 catalyzes the pyridine nucleotide-dependent reduction of nitrate to nitrite as a component of nitrate assimilation in plants, fungi, and algae (1­3). NR is a multicenter redox enzyme containing three cofactors: FAD, hemeiron, and molybdopterin-molybdate, which are noncovalently bound as one equivalent per 100-kDa polypeptide (4). The regions of the amino acid sequence which apparently bind the cofactors are independently folding fragments, some of which have been recombinantly expressed in functional form in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris (5­11). The cyt b reductase or CbR fragment of NR, which is composed of the carboxyterminal 260 amino acid residues, houses the FAD

binding site and the pyridine nucleotide active site for electron donation to the enzyme (6, 9, 12). Recombinant expression and mutagenesis of the CbR fragment of corn and spinach NADH:NR have demonstrated this fragment is a soluble 30-kDa protein with NADH: ferricyanide reductase activity (3, 6, 9, 12­14). CbR of corn NR has been crystallized and its 3-D structure determined by X-ray diffraction analysis (3, 15, 16). The conformation of CbR demonstrated that this fragment of NR is a member of the FNR family of flavoenzymes, which is named for ferredoxin NADP reductase (15, 17). The FNR family consists of redox enzymes from eukaryotes and prokaryotes containing either FAD or FMN, with 3-D structures available for FNR, PDR, NR's CbR, Cb5R, FHP, and most recently Anabaena FNR, FlxR, and CPR (3, 15­25). FNR-like enzymes have little amino acid sequence similarity across the family. Although some of the enzymes in the family have a long extension of one of the loops of the basic fold (25), all known structures contain two lobes or domains-- one for binding the flavin and one for binding the pyridine nucleotide cofactor. The active site of the FNR family enzymes is formed between the two nucleotide-cofactor binding domains. The positioning of the two domains relative to one another, which is the major difference among the structures, may be related to the electron acceptor for the flavin, which varies from ferredoxin to cyt b (or other heme-iron proteins) to flavodoxin (15, 17, 20, 22­25). The FAD and FMN binding domains of the FNR family are similar sixstranded beta barrels with one alpha helix. Little change of the basic folding of this domain of recombinant CbR of corn NR is found in the absence of the FAD in the apo form, where the orientation of the two domains is dramatically different than in the holo form (26). Thus, the flavin binding domain folds to a rather stable shape independent of the presence of the flavin nucleotide. The NADH/NADPH domain of FNR family members is a variation of the Rossman or dinucleotide fold found in many dehydrogenases and reductases (27), which is basically a five- or six-stranded parallel beta sheet with intervening alpha helices (3, 15, 17­ 25). An invariant Cys residue in the pyridine nucleotide cofactor binding domain of the FNR enzyme family, in most cases at the end of a beta sheet strand, is an identifying feature with the sequence motif Cys-Gly (3, 15­25, 28, 29). This Cys is apparently involved with improving efficiency of electron transfer from NADH/ NADPH to the flavin by assisting with positioning the pyridine nucleotide nicotinamide C-4, as shown by kinetic analysis comparing wild-type and mutant CbR forms (3, 12­14, 16, 30, 31). An alternate role for this invariant, active site Cys was suggested, from recent kinetic analysis of electron transfer in the recombinant cyt c reductase fragment of spinach NADH:NR, to be

promotion of the departure of the oxidized pyridine nucleotide after the reduction step (32). An interesting feature of the enzymes in the FNR family is that some are NADP /NADPH-specific, while others are NADH-specific (3, 15­25, 28). NR comes in these two forms as well as several types of bispecific NAD(P)H forms (1­3, 10, 15, 28). The structural models of the pyridine nucleotide binding domains of the FNR family members are very similar in overall 3-D conformation, despite the small degree of overall similarity in the amino acid sequences across the family (15­25, 27, 29). For corn NR's CbR and E. coli FlxR, a short beta strand is found in addition to the five strands in the central beta sheet of this domain (15, 22). While this extra beta strand is found in the region of binding of the ribose of the adenine of NADH in CbR, it is not characteristic of other NADH-dependent members of the FNR family; moreover, FlxR has a preference for NADPH. The fine structure of the binding pocket for the ribose 2 hydroxyl of the adenine of NADH and 2 phosphate of NADPH is defined for some members of the FNR family (3, 16 ­20, 22). For the NADH-dependent enzymes, CbR and PDR have an Asp residue at the end of third beta strand of their pyridine nucleotide binding domains, which is designated N 3, and has been shown to be a ligand to the 2 hydroxyl of NADH or ADP (Fig. 1A; 14, 15, 19, 20). The presence of a negatively charged side chain is characteristic of NAD /NADH binding sites (33, 34). An Asp residue is found in a similar position of Cb5R (Fig. 1A), but it has not been assigned as a ligand to NADH (21). For NADPH-dependent members of the FNR family, it appears that the ligands to the 2 phosphate of NADPH are in a similar position in the structure following the third beta strand of the domain (Fig. 1A). This is best defined in the 2 ,5 ADP complex of FNR where Ser234, Arg235, and Tyr246 interact with the 2 phosphate; these residues have been suggested to have a major role in determining specific binding of NADP in FNR (17, 18, 20). A similar assignment has been made for FlxR based on citrate binding in the apparent site for the 2 phosphate of NADPH, where Arg 174 and Arg184 in FlxR correspond to Arg235 and Tyr246 of FNR, respectively (17, 18, 20, 24). Although NADP was bound in the structure determined for CPR, the ligands to the 2 phosphate have not been defined (25). The sequence alignment shown for the FNR enzyme family in Fig. 1A emphasizes the role of the third beta strand of their pyridine nucleotide domains for positioning the ligands binding the ribose 2 hydroxyl or 2 phosphate of the coenzyme, but it also demonstrates the lack of any similarity in the sequences. To explore the nature of the pyridine nucleotide binding site of NR, we have mutated the recombinant CbR of Neurospora crassa NADPH:NR. The mutations were designed based on the 3-D structure of the CbR

fragment of corn NADH:NR in complex with ADP (3, 15, 16) and the sequence alignment of all NR forms and other members of the FNR family (Fig. 1). Marzluf and co-workers (10) also selected this region of N. crassa NADPH:NR for a mutagenesis study. We have studied this region via mutagenesis and detailed analysis of the steady-state kinetics of purified CbR fragment of N. crassa NADPH:NR. When substitutions were made for Ser920 and Arg932 of the N. crassa CbR (using numbering for holo-NADPH:NR), the pyridine nucleotide specificity of the mutated forms was altered toward NADH, while substitutions for Arg921 had no impact.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Expression vectors and site-directed mutagenesis. The DNA segment encoding the CbR fragment of N. crassa NADPH:NR was a kind gift of G. Marzluf (10). The CbR segment was directionally cloned into the E. coli expression vector pET23b (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) at BamHI and XhoI sites, which placed it in-frame for CbR protein expression with the natural stop signal in the same frame. This construct, designated pET23-NcCbR, has 12 amino acid residues from the vector at the N-terminus (Fig. 2A), which is similar to the CbR of corn NADH:NR expressed in E. coli (6, 12). The pET23-NcCbR was transformed into E. coli JM109(DE3)pLysS and expression of CbR of N. crassa NADPH:NR was done as previously described for corn CbR in a similar pET vector system (6, 12). A modification of the long primer-unique site elimination method was used for site-directed mutagenesis as previously described (35). The target amino acid residues (as shown in Fig. 2A) were mutated using synthetic oligonucleotides, which included changes in the restriction enzyme cleavage sites in the mutant plasmids relative to wild type to make it easier to select the mutated plasmids after the mutagenesis process (Table I). Subsequently, the wild-type and some mutant (S920D, R932Q, R932S, and the double mutant S920D/R932S) CbR coding segments were excised as a BamHI­XhoI nucleotide fragment which was cloned into the same restriction sites in pET30b. This cassette transfer resulted in a CbR protein with a (His)6 sequence on the N-terminus for use in metal-chelate affinity chromatography and an enterokinase recognition and cleavage site prior to the CbR protein for removal of the His-tag sequence (Fig. 2B). Purification of wild-type and mutant CbR. Wild-type and some mutant (R921S and R921T) CbR fragments of N. crassa NADPH:NR expressed in pET23b were purified from bacteria cells produced in a 1-liter culture with the crude extract prepared as previously described (6, 12). After centrifugation, ammonium sulfate fractionation was carried out to obtain the proteins precipitated between 45 and 60% saturation. The protein precipitate was dissolved in a minimum volume and exchanged into 30 mM Mops, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2, binding buffer, using an Amicon stirred cell with YM10 ultrafiltration membrane at 4°C. The final solution had a volume of 10 ml and could be frozen at 80°C at this stage. CbR was purified on 2 ,5 ADP Sepharose (Pharmacia) with elution by 100 M NADPH in the binding buffer. Subsequently, the CbR was exchanged into the binding buffer by pressure ultrafiltration to remove residual pyridine nucleotide prior to analysis for purity using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as previously described (4, 12). CbR protein content was evaluated by its absorbance at 460 nm using an extinction coefficient of 10 mM 1 cm 1 (6, 12). The Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard protein was used for determining protein in crude extracts. Wild-type and some mutant (S920D, R932Q, R932S, and the double mutant S920D/R932S) CbR forms expressed in pET30b with the His-tag on the N-terminus were treated the same as described above through the ammonium sulfate concentrating step except that they

The CbR of corn NADH:NR is the base sequence for this alignment with numbering shown for the recombinant enzyme fragment with identification of Asp205, a ligand to the 2 hydroxyl of ADP bound in complex with CbR, and Phe220, a residue lining the binding pocket (15, 16). Also shown are the beta sheet strands in this region of the NADH domain of CbR, which are designated N 3 and N 4. Vertical lines indicate the beginning and end of secondary structure elements and periods show gaps introduced in the sequences to adjust for length differences. (A) Partial sequences for members of the FNR family of enzymes with known 3-D structures are shown, which are divided into NADH forms: NR (CbR), Cb5R, PDR, and FHP (15, 16, 19 ­22); and NADPH/NADP forms: FNR (So, spinach; and Ana, Anabaena), FlxR, and CPR (17, 18, 20, 23­25). For the second group, the key residues interacting with the 2 phosphate of NADPH are identified with the numbering given for spinach FNR. (B) Partial sequences for representative NR forms are shown, which are divided into three groups.

done, fractions containing CbR were pooled, buffer-exchanged into 25 mM Mops, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2, and stored at 80°C. His-tag sequences were removed by incubation overnight at 4°C with 0.05 units of EKMax enterokinase (Invitrogen)/mg CbR using buffer provided by the manufacturer. The proteinase was removed by batch binding to soybean trypsin inhibitor resin (Sigma) with the resin collected by centrifugation. The supernatant was buffer-exchanged into metal-chelate binding buffer as above. The His-tag peptide was removed by passing the solution over another 1 ml Ni2 -chelate column with the CbR minus His-tag passing through without binding. The CbR minus His-tag was concentrated, buffer-exchanged into 25 mM Mops, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2, and stored at 80°C. Standard enzyme assays and steady state kinetic analysis. NAD(P)H: ferricyanide reductase activity of wild-type and mutant CbR fragments of N. crassa NADPH:NR was assayed at 25°C by monitoring decrease in absorbance at 340 nm, as previously described (6, 12). In general, activity assay results shown in this work represent the mean of three determinations to minimize random error introduced by minor variation in concentrations of reagents and enzyme under any given set of conditions used in the assay. The standard assay solution in a final volume of 1 ml contained 30 mM Mops, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM potassium ferricyanide, 0.1 mM NADH or NADPH, and 1 to 10 l of enzyme solution. The pH profile for the wild type and mutant CbR were determined using the standard activity assay by varying the buffer with fixed pH between 3.5 and 9. For wild type and S227E mutant enzyme without the His-tag, a sequence of buffer combinations was used, with the final ionic strength adjusted to 25 mM (calculated), according to the method of Ellis and Morrison (36). The buffer combinations used were: pH 3.5­5, acetate­Mes; pH 5­7.5, Mes­Mops; pH 7.5­9.5, Taps­Caps. All buffers were 25 mM with 0.1 mM EDTA. KCl was added to adjust to the desired ionic strength. Kinetic assays were performed at 25°C in a 1-ml cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. Reaction rates were monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 or 420 nm with a Shimadzu UV 1201 spectrophotometer or Hewlett Packard HP 8453 UV­visible spectrophotometer. NADH and NADPH concentrations were varied from 0.001 to 5.0 mM and K3Fe(CN)6 was used in excess (0.5 or 1.0 mM) as the electron acceptor. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme. Background activity was determined by monitoring the rate of the reaction without enzyme and these values were subtracted from the enzyme activity. Concentrations for NADH and NADPH were determined using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mM 1 cm 1 at 340 nm and for K3Fe(CN)6 using an extinction coefficient of 1.02 mM 1 cm 1 at 420 nm. When catalytic rates were determined by monitoring absorbance at 340 nm, an extinction coefficient of 6.9 mM 1 cm 1 was used to compensate for the decrease in absorbance due to the reduction of K3Fe(CN)6, and when rates were monitored at 420 nm, an extinction coefficient of 1.02 mM 1 cm 1 was used.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

SHIRAISHI ET AL.

Design of mutant CbR form with altered pyridine nucleotide specificity. Two types of information are available for applying in rational design of mutants of CbR with a different pyridine nucleotide specificity. First, there are many sequences of NR forms and the related FNR family enzymes; when these are aligned, potential differences in the key residues determining coenzyme specificity are easily identified (Fig. 1). Second is the 3-D structure of the complex of ADP with the CbR of corn NR (15, 16). The 3-D structures of FNR family members reveal the differences between NADH- and NADP / NADPH-utilizing enzyme forms (15­25). All the NADH forms have an Asp residue as ligand to the 2 hydroxyl of the coenzyme, while the NADP /NADPH forms have a combination of residues interacting with the 2 phosphate, such as Ser234, Arg235, and Tyr246 in spinach FNR (Fig. 1A). However, there are significant differences in the length of the sequence region assigned to this portion of the structures. For the NR family, the NADH:, NAD(P)H:, and NADPH:NR forms also have distinct differences in sequence in this selected region (Fig. 1B). By using the corn CbR 3-D structure to define the secondary structure of NR forms, the sequence region predicted to form the third and fourth beta strands in the pyridine nucleotide domain are not difficult to locate, which makes it possible to identify the potential key residues for the determining coenzyme specificity. While one of these residues is Asp205 in corn CbR as shown in the 3-D structure of the ADP complex with this NR fragment (15, 16), which corresponds to Asp850 in barley NADH:NR (37), this is not an invariant residue in all NADH:NR forms, with some having Glu or Gln in this position (Fig. 1B). Bispecific NAD(P)H:NR forms have Lys or Ser in this position, while NADPH:NR forms have Ser or Thr. In N. crassa NADPH:NR, this is Ser920, which is directly followed by an Arg, making this form of NR similar to FNR in this pair of residues. However, the Arg921 in N. crassa is not a conserved residue in the NADPH:NR family where it is replaced by Lys, Asn, Gln, or Asp (Fig. 1B). Since one expects that a positively charged side chain will contribute importantly to the binding site for the negatively charged 2 phosphate of NADPH, it appears this is probably a residue other than Arg921. As will be described below, Phe220 in corn CbR, an invariant residue in NADH:NR forms, lines the binding site of the 2 hydroxyl of ADP, which suggests that corresponding residues in other NR forms may be part of the binding site. In NAD(P)H:NR forms, this is either a Tyr or Arg residue, while in most NADPH:NR forms this is an Arg residue (Fig. 1B). In summary, the sequence alignments suggest that the key residues to investigate for a role in determining pyridine nucleotide specificity in N. crassa NADPH:NR are Ser920, Arg921, and Arg932.

Although key sequence differences between NADH: and NADPH:NR forms were first identified based solely on the 3-D structure of FNR (17, 28), more confidence in these assignments was gained after the 3-D structure of the corn CbR was determined, especially in complex with ADP (15, 16). The model of the ADP­CbR complex revealed that a side chain oxygen of Asp205 is within 5 Å of the 2 hydroxyl of the ribose of ADP (Fig. 3A). The only other polar side chain in the vicinity is Arg176, and this appears to be more strongly interacting with the 3 hydroxyl of the ADP ribose (16). The other side chains in the 2 hydroxyl binding pocket are Ala174 and Val221. However, there are some backbone polar atoms also in the pocket, namely the amide nitrogens of Asn175, Phe220, and Val221, but the overall character of the 2 hydroxyl pocket is hydrophobic with the CB carbons of Ala174 (not shown in Fig. 3) and Phe220, as well as its phenyl ring, contributing significantly (Fig. 3A). The residues of N. crassa NADPH:NR corresponding to the corn CbR residues Ala174, Asn175, Arg176, Asp205, Phe220, and Val221 are Gly887, Asn888, Arg889, Ser920, Arg932, and Leu933, respectively. Since there is about 35% identity between the amino acid sequences of the corn and N. crassa CbR forms, an atom-replacement model was generated for N. crassa CbR and was superimposed on structure of corn CbR with ADP bound (1CNF in the Protein Data Base) so that the ADP was visualized with key residues of the model for N. crassa CbR (Fig. 3B). The three residues identified by sequence alignment are shown in this model: Ser920, Arg921, and Arg932. Although ADP was not modeled with a 2 phosphate, it is interesting that the model appears to have a larger binding pocket in the region of the 2 hydroxyl with interatomic distances of 9.85 to 12.3 Å from it to the side chain atoms (Fig. 3B). Clearly, the orientation of the side chain groups of Ser920, Arg921, and Arg932 are not optimized for interaction with a 2 phosphate, however, these side chains do appear to have the potential to interact with the pyridine nucleotide substrate. Thus, our site-directed mutagenesis experiments were focused on Ser920, Arg921, and Arg932 to analyze if these residues are important in determining pyridine nucleotide coenzyme specificity for N. crassa CbR and, by inference, N. crassa NADPH:NR. While Ser920 was replaced by Asp to make it like NADH:NR, the Arg residues at 921 and 932 were simply replaced by polar, noncharged residues to determine if loss of the positive charge impacted pyridine nucleotide specificity. Expression and mutagenesis of the recombinant CbR of N. crassa NADPH:NR in E. coli. The coding sequence for the CbR fragment of N. crassa NADPH:NR, which had been previously subcloned (10), was transferred to the E. coli expression vector pET23b (Fig. 2A) and expressed in a pLysS background as we had done

Ferricyanide reductase activity was determined by monitoring pyridine nucleotide oxidation, as described under Materials and Methods, where change in A340 nm was converted to mol/min using an extinction coefficient of 6.9 mM 1 cm 1, thus correcting for the change in A340 nm due to reduction of ferricyanide, which slightly absorbs at A340 nm in the oxidized form but not the reduced. These rates were converted to a per electron basis by multiplying by 2. One unit of activity is defined as 1 mol ferricyanide reduced per minute.

The recombinant CbR of N. crassa NADPH:NR was strongly expressed in this system and the wildtype NADPH:ferricyanide reductase was easily purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using 2 ,5 ADP Sepharose with NADPH elution (data not shown). The recombinant CbR fragment retained the high specificity for NADPH as electron donor which is found with the natural holo-NADPH:NR of N. crassa (38). The target residues, which are Ser920, Arg921, and Arg932 (10; Figs. 2A and 3B), were mutated using appropriate oligonucleotide primers (Table I) and a modified PCRbased long-primer unique site elimination method (35). The mutant enzyme forms generated were S920D, R921S, R921T, R932S, R932Q, and the double mutant S920D/R932S (Fig. 2A). Since some mutant proteins lacked affinity for the 2 ,5 ADP Sepharose, the coding sequences were moved to a pET vector with a cleavable His-tag (Fig. 2B). The wild-type and four mutated coding segments (S920D, R932S, R932Q, and the double mutant S920D/R932S) were moved to pET30 by cassette replacement as described under Materials and Methods. High levels of expression of all forms were obtained and the active ferricyanide reductase enzymes were easily purified by Ni2 -metal chelate column chromatography and elution with imidazole. The N-terminal peptide containing the His-tag was successfully cleaved from the purified His-tagged CbR forms using recombinant enterokinase and the His-tag fragment peptide removed by binding to the Ni2 metal chelate column, as described under Materials and Methods. The cleaved CbR proteins without Histag (Fig. 2B), which differed only at the N-termini from the original recombinant forms, behaved essentially the same as those forms obtained by expression with

the pET23b vector sequence on the N-terminus (data not shown). The mutant CbR forms R921S and R921T were purified using 2 ,5 ADP Sepharose. The yield from purification by either binding to the nucleotide column or the metal chelate column was from 14 to 41% of activity found in the crude extract of the expressing bacteria; highest yields were obtained for the wild type, purified by either method, and the lowest yields were for R932S and the double mutant 920E/ R932S (data not shown). In all cases, 1 to 5 mg of purified enzyme, as measured by the specific absorbance of the enzyme bound FAD at 460 nm (6, 12), was obtained from 1 liter of bacterial culture; analysis using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the purified wild-type and mutant CbR forms were electrophoretically homogeneous 30kDa proteins, which is the expected size (data not shown). Properties of the wild-type and mutant CbR fragments of N. crassa NADPH:NR. Comparison of the NADPH: and NADH:ferricyanide reductase specific activity of the wild-type and mutant CbR forms demonstrated that two of the target residues (Ser920 and Arg932) were important for the enzyme's interaction with the pyridine nucleotide substrates (Table II). The S920D mutant form retained only 2% of the NADPH activity of the wild type while it had an increased NADH activity, 15 times greater than wild type, which essentially reversed the coenzyme specificity of the CbR from NADPH-specific in the wild type to NADH-specific in the S920D mutant. Substitution for Arg921 had little impact on the NADPH and NADH activity or their ratio (Table II), which indicates that the side chain of this residue is

not important for catalytic function or pyridine nucleotide specificity. Together the results for Ser920 and Arg921 suggest that this pair of amino acid side chains is arranged in the CbR of N. crassa NADPH:NR in a conformation similar to Asp205 and Gln206 in the CbR of corn NADH:NR and not like the Ser-Arg pair in FNR (15­18, 20). That is to say, Ser920 appears to be a ligand to the pyridine nucleotide coenzyme like Asp205, while Arg921 is not a ligand and most likely faces the solution surrounding the enzyme like Gln206 (16). The Ser-Arg pair in FNR both interact with the coenzyme as ligands to the 2 phosphate of NADPH (17, 18, 20). Thus, N. crassa NADPH:CbR is more like corn NADH:CbR in arrangement of ligands to the 2 substituent pocket of the pyridine nucleotide site than it is like NADP specific FNR. In comparison to our results for Ser920 and Arg921, Gonzalez et al. (10) found that NADPH:NR activity of modified N. crassa NR transformed back into an N. crassa NR-deficient mutant strain was decreased by about 40% compared to wild type when Ala was substituted for Ser920 and increased by about 75% in Thr for Ser920 mutant. For Arg921, substitution of Thr resulted in retention of 90% of the wild-type activity, while substitution of Gly and Ala resulted in decreased NADPH:NR activity, which might be expected even if Arg921 is oriented toward the surface of the protein and away from the binding pocket for the 2 phosphate of NADPH. They also prepared a construct of CbR of N. crassa NADPH:NR (called the flavin domain) and expressed it in E. coli along with the mutants (10). In these results, NADPH:ferricyanide reductase activity was decreased by 90% compared to the wild type when Ala was substituted for Ser920, while substitution of Thr resulted in 50% decrease. For Arg921, substitution of Gly, Ala, and Thr resulted in 80, 50, and 65% decrease relative to wild type, respectively. They concluded that Ser920 was probably important in N. crassa NADPH:NR for binding to the 2 phosphate of NADPH (10), which is consistent with the results reported here. Their finding that Thr substitution for Ser920 does not impact NADPH-dependent activities greatly in both the holo-enzyme, where it apparently was increased, and the CbR fragment is consistent with the sequence comparisons for fungal NADPH:NR forms which show that some of these have Thr in the position corresponding to Ser920 (Fig. 1). It is unfortunate that the NADH:NR and ferricyanide reductase activities of these transformants were not evaluated. The substitutions at Arg932 in the R932Q and R932S mutant CbR forms both result in a decrease in activity and an altered ratio of NADPH:NADH activity 1 (Table II). About 4 of the wild-type NADPH activity is

1 retained in R932Q and about 10 in R932S. Nearly twice as much NADH activity is present in R932Q as compared to the wild type while the R932S form retains 2 about 3 of wild-type NADH activity. These changes result in a decrease of the NADPH:NADH activity ratio by a factor of 10 comparing the Arg932 substitutions to wild type (Table II). The double mutant S920D/R932S has the greatest decrease in activity and the most altered NADPH:NADH activity ratio, with this mutant form of CbR favoring NADH by more than 1000-fold as compared to wild type (Table II). These results indicate not only that is Arg932 a residue interacting with the pyridine nucleotide coenzyme electron donors, but also that Ser920 and Arg932 have somewhat additive effects on substrate binding and catalytic activity. In addition, it can be suggested that both residues may be ligands to the 2 phosphate of NADPH in the wild-type CbR, with Ser920 probably hydrogen bonding with the 2 phosphate of NADPH, like Ser234 of FNR, while Arg932 may provide the positive charge for binding the negative charge of the 2 phosphate. So Arg932 may sit in a position more like Tyr246 in FNR, but provides the ion-pairing ligand like Arg235 in FNR which is found in most NADPH binding sites (17, 18, 20). As can be expected when large side chains like Arg are replaced by smaller side chains like Ser and Gln, R932S and R932Q have lower activity than the wild-type form due to a general loss of stability in the active site, with the effect being greater in the mutant with the smaller Ser side chain (Table II). In the FNR 3-D structures, Tyr246 (Tyr235 in Anabaena FNR) lies across the NADP binding site on one side of the adenine (17, 18, 20, 23). If Arg932 is also oriented across the NADPH binding site in N. crassa CbR, then mutation to smaller residues might also disturb the binding of the coenzyme's adenine group and generally weaken its binding. Attempts to generate a mutant where Arg932 was replaced by Phe, which may be the ideal replacement residue since Phe is found in this position in most NADH:NR forms (Fig. 1B), have not yet succeeded. Two tests were done to determine if the global conformation of N. crassa CbR had been altered by introduction of the amino acid substitutions in the mutant forms as compared to wild type. Incubation of wild-type and S920D CbR at 40°C resulted in less than 50% loss of activity in 60 min, with the mutant form retaining more activity during the incubation. None of the mutant forms required special handling during purification and routine analysis, which provided a general indication of similar thermal stability to the wild type. However, more detailed analysis of thermal stability of the CbR wild type and mutant forms is needed. Spectral analysis revealed that all forms had properties similar to typical flavoproteins (Fig. 4). These spectra are very similar to previously published spectra for the CbR fragment of corn NADH:NR (6, 12, 14). The His-tagged wild-type, S920D,

(B) N. crassa CbR mutants Ser920Asp, Arg932Gln, Arg932Ser, and double mutant (DM) Ser920Asp/Arg932Ser, as expressed in pET30b form with His-tag. All CbR forms were purified and had protein concentrations in the range of 7 to 65 M. Spectra were taken at 25°C, in 25 mM Mops, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2, with an HP8453 UV­vis spectrophotometer. Spectra were normalized using an extinction coefficient of 10 mM 1 cm 1 at 460 nm.

R932Q, R932S, and double mutant S920D/R932S CbR forms had very similar visible spectra (Figs. 4A and 4B). The spectra of the pET23-expressed forms of R921S and R921T closely resembled the wild type (data not shown). As shown previously for corn CbR wild-type and mutant forms (12), visible spectra can reveal altered structure in the mutant forms. Thus, the spectral similarity of N. crassa CbR wild type and mutants is a good indication that the global conformations of the wild type and six mutant forms of CbR are virtually the same. This indicates the substitution for these three amino acid residues (Ser920, Arg921, and Arg932) in the "NADPH" domain had little influence on the FAD domain. However, other spectral methods of analysis, such as circular dichroism (9, 13, 14), will be used in the future to determine if more subtle changes in global conformation exist in the mutant forms. On the other hand, the pH profiles of the CbR forms were influenced by the presence of the N-terminal modifications and some of the amino acid residue replace-

ments in the mutants. For example, the pH optimum of the wild type was shifted from pH 7 in the His-tag form to about 6 after the His-tag was removed (data not shown). In the S920D mutant CbR, the pH profile was much broader than in wild type with optimum pH near 5 in the form with the His-tag removed. Providing a constant ionic strength buffer in the pH profile analysis did not fully remove these effects and it was not obvious why the different enzymes forms were responding so differently to changes in pH. It was clear that the effect of pH on the enzyme activity profiles requires more detailed studies. To simplify the detailed kinetic analysis, a single pH of 7.5, which is the pH optimum of N. crassa NADPH:NR (38), was used where all the forms had a high level of activity. Steady state kinetic analysis of wild-type and mutant CbR forms with NADPH and NADH. Apparent Km and kcat kinetic constants were determined for wildtype and selected mutant CbR forms of N. crassa NADPH:NR using both NADPH and NADH as the variable substrate with ferricyanide at a saturating concentration (Table III). From these results it was clear that the standard assay conditions used for routine analysis were too low in pyridine nucleotide concentration (0.1 mM NADH or NADPH) to obtain maximal activity (Table II). In fact, it is not practical to raise the NADH concentration to saturation for assaying the wild type since it has a Km of about 3 mM. In addition, the requirement for high pyridine nucleotide concentrations in the assays made it necessary to monitor the disappearance of ferricyanide at 420 nm rather than NADPH and NADH at 340 nm. The outcome is that NADH supports a better activity for the wild-type CbR of 21% of NADPH (compare kcat values in Table III) than was found in the standard assays where NADH activity is less than 1% of the NADPH activity (Table II). Since all the mutants had high Km values for both NADPH and NADH, the determination of the kcat showed that all the mutants had more activity than had been estimated with the standard assay results shown in Table II. Thus, the impact of the mutations was to a great extent on substrate binding and less on the transfer of electrons from the pyridine nucleotide to the FAD. For example, the S920D mutant CbR has a greater kcat with NADH than wild-type CbR does with NADPH (Table III). From the Km and kcat values, the catalytic efficiency or kcat/Km for each enzyme form with both electron donors was calculated and these were compared to derive the pyridine nucleotide specificity ratio for wildtype and selected mutant CbR forms (Table III). When the NADPH:NADH specificity ratio of the wild type was set as the standard and the mutants compared to it, the changes in the specificity of the enzyme forms were clearly evident (Table III).

Enzyme concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 460 nm using an extinction coefficient of 10 mM 1 cm 1 (6). Electrophoretically homogeneous enzyme forms without His-tag were used in these experiments. Kinetic constants were derived using nonlinear fitting to the Michaelis­Menten equation. b The specificity ratio is presented in two forms: absolute specificity ratio, defined as (kcat/Km)NADPH/(kcat/Km)NADH; and relative specificity ratio, defined as ((kcat/Km)NADPH/(kcat/Km)NADH)wild-type/((kcat/Km)NADPH/(kcat/Km)NADH)mutant.

crassa NADPH:NR prefers NADPH over NADH by a factor of over 1000. Little change in specificity factors were found when Arg921 is substituted in the R921S and R921T mutant forms, which confirmed earlier conclusions that Arg921 is probably not interacting with the 2 phosphate of NADPH in the wild type (data not shown). A large impact on pyridine nucleotide specificity is observed with replacement of Ser920 with Asp (S920D CbR form) where NADH is preferred over NADPH by a factor of 6, but relative to wild type the specificity is reversed by a factor of over 6000 (Table III). Replacement of Arg932 had less of an impact on pyridine nucleotide specificity as observed with the R932S mutant CbR, where NADPH is still the preferred substrate but now only by a factor of 16. Finally, when both Ser920 and Arg 932 are replaced as in the double mutant S920D/R932S CbR form, the effects of the individual replacements on pyridine nucleotide specificity are combined and the NADH is the preferred substrate by a factor of 67 over NADPH with a relative reversal of specificity by a factor of over 70,000 (Table III). These results tend to suggest that both Ser920 and Arg932 play a role in determining which pyridine nucleotide binds in the active site of the CbR of N. crassa NADPH:NR and also how well it binds, while Arg921 probably plays no role. However, the mutation of Arg932 has a more selective effect on NADPH as substrate than it does on NADH. For example, the R932S mutant is about 60 times less efficient with NADPH as electron donor than the wild type, while the efficiency with NADH is about the same for the both the wild-type and mutant forms (Table III). In the S920D/R932S double mutant form, catalytic efficiency with NADPH is markedly decreased as compared to wild type or the single mutant forms, while efficiency with NADH is about the same

as the wild type. So in the double mutant, the improvement in utilization of NADH observed when Ser920 was substituted with Asp is lost to a great extent due to a decrease both in substrate binding and reaction velocity. This tends to suggest that the impact of substitution at Arg932 is a more general effect on the integrity of the pyridine nucleotide binding site than a specific effect on a ligand to 2 phosphate of NADPH. For example, Arg932 may be playing a role in binding the adenine ring of NADPH in N. crassa NR and the substitution of Ser or Gln for this residue simply weakens substrate binding to the enzyme in a general fashion. Since a structural model is not yet available for the N. crassa CbR fragment or holo NADPH:NR, it is not possible to assign a definitive role to Arg932 based on the current results; further studies are necessary to gain a better understanding of the NADPH binding site in this NR form.
CONCLUSION

We have focused on the fine structure of the NADPH domain of the CbR fragment of N. crassa NADPH:NR (Fig. 2; 3, 6, 9 ­14). Our designed approach to sitedirected mutagenesis of the amino acid residues directly involved in determining pyridine nucleotide specificity in NR involved sequence comparisons in the target region (Fig. 1) and 3-D structures of the complex of ADP with CbR of corn NADH:NR (Fig. 3A; 15, 16) and of FNR and PDR with bound 2 ,5 ADP and NAD , respectively (17­20, 23). An atom replacement model of NADPH:CbR was made using the sequence of N. crassa NADPH:NR with the corn NADH:CbR model (16), which indicated that three amino acid side chains were potentially interacting with the 2 phosphate of NADPH (Fig. 3B). Using the numbering of

114

SHIRAISHI ET AL.

holo-NADPH:NR from N. crassa (10), the three residues targeted for mutagenesis are Ser920, Arg921, and Arg932. These residues sit at the end of the predicted third beta strand in NADPH domain of the N. crassa CbR model, just as the similar residues for determining pyridine nucleotide specificity do in other members of the FNR family enzymes (Fig. 1; 15­25). These residues fit with sequence patterns of specificity determining residues for FNR family enzymes (Fig. 1), especially for the residues predicted to be ligands of the 2 phosphate of NADP for FNR--Ser234, Arg235, and Tyr246 (17, 19). However, in the complex of ADP with corn CbR where Asp205 ligands with the 2 hydroxyl group (Fig. 3A, 16), there are few other polar side-chain ligands and it is important to recognize that the polar Gln206 appears to face the solvent. Thus, our studies addressed the question of whether NADPH:NR is more like FNR or NADH:NR in positioning of ligands for the binding of 2 phosphate of NADPH. For recombinant N. crassa CbR, we made a single substitution of Asp for Ser920, which reversed the NADPH:NADH specificity ratio of the mutant as compared to wild type (Tables II and III). Ser and Thr substitutions were prepared for Arg921 and neither of them had much impact on the activities of the recombinant CbR with NADPH and NADH as electron donor (Table II). We concluded that Ser920 is a ligand involved in binding the 2 phosphate of NADPH in the wild-type enzyme, which is consistent with the conclusions of an earlier site-directed mutagenesis study of this residue (10), and Arg921 is probably facing the solution or near the surface of the enzyme with little role in pyridine nucleotide binding or specificity. Thus, we conclude that the residues forming the binding pocket for the 2 phosphate of NADPH in N. crassa CbR, and by inference in the holo-enzyme, are probably arranged more like the residues in the binding pocket for 2 hydroxyl of ADP in NADH:NR forms, as represented by the 3-D structure of corn CbR (15, 16), than like the residues in FNR and other NADPH-dependent members of the FNR family of enzymes. The ease with which N. crassa CbR was converted from NADPHspecific to virtually NADH-specific by substituting Asp for Ser920 suggests that a similar substitution of Asp205 in corn CbR by a Ser, as is found in monocot bispecific NAD(P)H:NR forms, might also convert it from NADH-specific to NAD(P)H-bispecific enzyme. Thus, it appears that the key difference among NR forms with respect to pyridine nucleotide specificity is the presence/absence of an acidic residue in the position following the N 3 beta strand of the pyridine nucleotide binding domain. However, this conclusion requires further testing by generating mutants of an NADH:NR form where the acidic residue is converted to a small, neutral polar residue.
