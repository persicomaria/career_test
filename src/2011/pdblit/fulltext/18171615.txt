Abstract--Inhibition of the aspartyl protease BACE-1 has the potential to deliver a disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease. Herein, is described the lead generation effort which resulted, with the support of X-ray crystallography, in the discovery of potent inhibitors based on a hydroxy ethylamine (HEA) transition-state mimetic. These inhibitors were capable of lowering amyloid production in a cell-based assay. Ó 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive formation of insoluble amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.1 These plaques are mainly comprised of a small 4 kDa amyloid-b (Ab) peptide, generated by the proteolytic processing of a larger membrane bound precursor protein, known as the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Cleavage of APP by BACE-1 (for b-site APP cleaving enzyme, also known as b-secretase, Memapsin-2 or Asp-2) releases an extracellular soluble APP fragment. This is concomitant with the generation of a membrane-tethered C-terminal fragment that is subsequently processed by c-secretase to generate Ab peptides, predominantly of 40 or 42 amino acids in length (Ab40, Ab42).2 In an alternative non-amyloidogenic pathway, cleavage of APP by a-secretase within the amyloid-b region of APP precludes the release of intact Ab.

Mice genetically deficient in BACE-1 show no Ab production3a,b and are healthy, viable and fertile,3a­c suggesting that BACE-1 inhibition is unlikely to be associated with mechanism-based toxicity. For these reasons, inhibition of this enzyme is considered to be an attractive therapeutic target. Following the classification of BACE-1 as an aspartyl protease,4 extensive efforts have resulted in the discovery of potent and selective inhibitors.5 In most cases, the strategy for the design of inhibitors has been based on the transitionstate mimetic concept, an approach that has been used successfully to design inhibitors of other aspartyl proteases, most notably HIV protease.6 This approach typically relies on replacement of the scissile amide bond of an appropriate substrate with a stable mimetic of the putative transition state.

GSK188909 was recently reported to be the first BACE1 inhibitor capable of lowering brain Ab in APP transgenic mice following oral administration.7 Herein, and in subsequent letters, the studies which led to the discovery of this orally active inhibitor are described. Bearing in mind the need to deliver inhibitors with druglike properties, we preferred not to start with large peptidic compounds based on the EVKM-DAE (APP Wild Type, WT) or EVNL-DAE (APP Swedish Mutation, SWE) sequences of the natural substrates. Our strategy instead focused on the preparation of arrays of hydroxy ethylamines (HEAs) starting from the known8 Boc epoxides 1, 2 and 3, and limiting ourselves to molecules with MW < 700 and containing no more than 2 amide bonds (Fig. 1).

With this in mind, a number of a-amino amides were selected to add to epoxides 1­3. Removal of the Boc protecting group provided amines 4­6 which were then coupled to a small set of carboxylic acids. From an initial array, 7 was one of the first compounds to show micromolar activity against BACE-1 (Table 1). The analogue 8, with Leu in the P1 position, proved much less active. This was somewhat surprising since the Swedish-mutant substrate has Leu in the P1 position and is turned over more rapidly than the wild-type substrate. The requirement for R-stereochemistry at the hydroxyl group was confirmed by compound 9 derived from the S,R-epoxide 3. N-Methylation of the hydroxy ethylamine isostere was not tolerated (compound 10). All subsequent SAR was therefore developed using the central core of compound 7. Initially, the effect of modifications of the P1 0 and the P2 0 substituents on BACE-1 inhibition was explored, but despite extensive effort, no improvement of potency could be found compared to the hit 7. The contribution of the meta-substituted benzamide non-prime side was then investigated (Table 2), choosing BACE-2 and Cat-D,9 both structurally related to BACE-1, as representative aspartyl protease for selectivity screens. A large range of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) were tolerated in this position (see compounds 11 and 12 as representative examples) whilst inhibitors with other substitution patterns were less potent (see compound 13 for example).10 More lipophilic meta-HBAs led to a modest increase in potency (compound 14) which was sufficient to obtain a co-crystal structure of the inhibitor with a human BACE-1 construct.11 The key H-bond interactions between inhibitor 14 and BACE-1 are depicted below (Fig. 2) and help with understanding some of the results presented above.

Interestingly, the co-crystal structure showed that the sulfone on the non-prime side of the inhibitor makes a hydrogen bond with the enzyme, allowing access to the S3 pocket from the other meta-position (Fig. 3). It seemed reasonable that filling this narrow pocket with an appropriate substituent might increase the potency of our inhibitors. This idea was explored further after first replacing the sulfone H-bond acceptor with a pyrrolidinone. Incorporation of this group gave inhibitors with similar potency (compare 7 and 12, Table 2), but it was felt that the lower polar surface area would increase the chance of obtaining compounds with a degree of brain penetration. The substituted benzoic acids required to complete this study

that allows access and additive binding in the S3 pocket by a group in the other meta-position. The latter hypothesis appeared to be corroborated by a co-crystal structure of compound 21 with the enzyme (Fig. 5) in which an appropriate H-bond was observed. The structure did not, however, make it entirely clear as to why an n-propyl chain led to a 5- to 20-fold loss in potency when compared with shorter or longer alkyl chains in the same position.12 Extensive exploration of the SAR at the S3 pocket was initiated, with the aim of increasing activity and selectivity whilst keeping the polar surface area as low as possible in order to improve the likelihood of obtaining brain penetrant inhibitors. It appeared that a linear threeatom chain gave the best compromise between size, potency and selectivity (Table 4, compare 22 and 23­25), with the NH-linked derivatives being the most potent and selective (compare 22 and 17, 26). At this stage, efforts were shifted towards further simplification of the prime-side by replacement of the P1 0 ­P2 0 amide, as it was felt that this strategy was more likely to lead to the identification of drug-like inhibitors of BACE-1 with the potential for good oral bioavailability and CNS penetration (Fig. 6). In summary, in this first round of optimisation of hydroxy ethylamine BACE-1 inhibitors, P2 and P3 substituents which gave good potency and selectivity over

An additional substituent of sufficient bulk did appear to improve binding and inhibitors 17­19 (Table 3), for example, were more potent than the unsubstituted analogue 12 or derivative 16 with the smaller methoxy substituent. On examining the length of the chain in the S3 pocket, it was found that a three-atom chain length led to a more substantial increase in potency (100-fold, compare 17, 18 and 12, 16), whilst compounds with a longer chain in this position proved no more active and were generally less selective versus BACE-2 and Cat-D (compound 19). The inhibition of BACE-1 by these compounds was also demonstrated to result in a reduction in amyloid-b (Ab40 and Ab42) production in cells expressing APP WT. Replacement of the pyrrolidinone by a pyrrolidine ring (compound 20) resulted in a 25-fold reduction in potency, suggesting that a hydrogen bonding interaction with the enzyme in this position was needed in order to lock the benzamide non-prime side in a conformation

Substitution ortho to the amide functionality was in general poorly tolerated (data not shown). Asp2N153, 172, 223, 354Q/Fc was expressed in CHO secretion system with thrombin cleavage sites engineered after residues 45 and 460 (pro/thr/Asp2QQQQ/thr/Fc). Pro/thr/Asp2QQQQ/thr/Fc was captured by ProSep-A High Capacity resin (Bioprocessing Limited) and neutralized eluate dialysed into 25 mM Hepes, 0.25 M NaCl, pH 7.4. Soluble Asp2QQQQ was released by cleavage with bovine alpha thrombin (Haematologic Technologies Inc.). ProSep A unbound of the thrombin digest was further truncated by pepsin at pH 4.6. V61-E452 form of Asp2QQQQ was purified from the neutralized pepsin digest by MonoQ (GE Healthcare) at pH 7.4. Crystals of apo Asp2 were grown at 20 °C using the hanging drop vapour diffusion method combined with streak seeding. Protein at 10 mg/mL was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the reservoir solution consisting of 10% PEG8000 and 0.1 M glycine, pH 3.2. Crystals were soaked overnight in the mother liquor to which approximately 0.1 mg of solid compound was added. The crystals were cryoprotected by serial transfer into a solution of mother liquor with 30% glycerol and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. The X-ray was collected at ESRF. The PDB deposition codes and refinement details for the BACE-1 complex ° crystal structures are: 14 (2viy, 1.8 A resolution, ° R = 0.181, Rfree = 0.216); 21 (2viz, 1.6 A resolution, R = 0.198, Rfree = 0.227). This effect was also observed with HBAs other than pyrrolidinone.
