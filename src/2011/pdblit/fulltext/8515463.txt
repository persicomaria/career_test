The decanucleotide duplex d(AAAACGITI'T) 2 and a variety of phase-sensitive two-dimensional (2D) NMR experiments have been used to investigate the solution conformation of an adenine-tract and its junction with another DNA sequence. 2D nuclear Overhauser effect data confirm that the oligonucleotide has a general B-type DNA morphology but an array of unusual correlations implies that the adenine tract and the 5'-ApC junction have conformations more compatible with the modified X-ray structures recently reported for DNAs of similar sequence (Nelson, H.C.M., Finch, J.T., Luisi, B.F. and King, A. (1987) Nature 330, 221-226). The pattern and magnitude of interstrand NOEs from the adenine H2s to the sugar H l ' s of the complementary base to the 5'-neighbouring residue indicate that the A-T basepairs are highly propeller twisted and that the minor groove is narrowed, showing its greatest compression at the 3'-end of the tract at the 5'-ApC step. Quantifying spin-coupling interactions within the deoxyribose rings by analysing both 1D and high-resolution 2D DQF-COSY data reveals that the conformation of the purines is predominantly C2'-endo, with the pseudorotation phase angle P lying in the range 140-180 o. For the pyrimidines, however, there are distortions away from this standard B-type geometry with the data being best described by P values lying in the range 90-130 ° (i.e., O4'-endo, Cl'-exo). The sugar puckers of A1, T9 and T10 are dynamically distorted no doubt as a consequence of their positions at, or close to, the ends of the duplex. Thus the conformation of the adenine and thymine sugars within the oligo(dA) and oligo(dT) strands are different with an abrupt change in sugar puckering occurring at the 5'-ApC (5'-GpT) step. Peculiar chemical shifts values for A4H2, T7CH 3 and sugar C5 HI', I-I2' and H2", together with a number of interresidue NOEs with unusual intensities, imply that there are also substantial modifications to basepair stacking interactions at this step. Taken as a whole, our data are consistent with the view that the conformational dislocation at the 5'-ApC dinucleotide results from a combination of slide and roll manoeuvres and that the junction between the A A A and CG sequences is a potential nucleation site for DNA bending.

Introduction

Adenine tracts and their junctions with other nucleotides have attracted much attention recently because of the capacity of oligo(dA) sequences to induce static curvature in DNA. The biological importance of this phenomenon is highlighted, for example, by the finding that A + T-rich sequences of DNA associated with gene regulatory regions are bent [1-3]. Curvature was first discovered in fragments of trypanosomal kinetoplast DNA which were observed to migrate anomo-

lously in polyacrylamide gels [4-6], and subsequent studies using differential birefringence methods [5-7] and electron microscopy [8] confirmed static curvature in intact kinetoplast minicircles. Many genetically important DNA fragments that show anomolous gel migration properties have periodically repeating runs of adenine bases at the locus of curvature [9]. Runs of about five basepairs of oligo(dA) are typically observed, the homopolymer tracts being phased every helical turn [6]. Investigations into the sequence determinants of bending have shown that significant curvature can be induced by a minimum of three consecutive adenine bases within each helical repeat, maximum bending being observed for a run of six As [4,5]. These studies also showed that accurate phasing of the 3'-end of the adenine tract is important, suggesting that the 3'-junction is the primary bending site in sequences of the type 5'-(A)3_6 X-3' where X is a pyrimidine nucleotide [4].

70 Two principal hypotheses have been proposed to account for the phenomenon of adenine tract-induced curvature. The first of these, the Trifonov 'wedge' model [10] proposes that DNA bends smoothly along the full length of the oligo(dA) tract as a consequence of a combination of roll and tilt manoeuvres peculiar to AA dinucleotides. By contrast, the 'junction-bend' model of Crothers et al. [4,6] asserts that bending occurs abruptly at the junction between the adenine tract and other sequences. This model also assumes that the oligo(dA) tract is structurally distinct from regular B-type DNA, and there bending is described as being a consequence of the requirement to optimise base stacking interactions through the junction between non-B- and B-type DNA. Recently, several investigators have used oligonucleotide duplexes to elucidate structural details of adenine tracts and their junctions in both the crystalline state and in solution. X-ray diffraction studies of d(CGCAAAAAAGCG) [11] and d(CGCAAAAATGCG) [121 and their complements show that oligo(dA) sequences have a well-defined conformation that falls within the family of B-type structures but which differs substantially from the standard B geometry. Of special importance is the finding that adenine tracts have a particularly straight appearence and pronounced conformational rigidity, both characteristics attributable to highly propellor-twisted basepairs and an unusual array of bifurcated hydrogen bonds in the major groove [11]. These features are not consistent with the structural requirements of the wedge model for DNA bending, but they do account for the reluctance of poly(dA) · poly(dT) fibres to undergo environmentally-induced changes in conformation [13], and for why poly(dA) · poly(dT) will not fold into nucleosomes [14,15]. With the aim of contributing to an understanding of the solution conformation of DNAs containing an adenine tract we have undertaken, and report here, a 1H-NMR study of the self-complementary duplex d(AAAACGTTTT)2 which incorporates the 5'-AAAAC sequence found in a number of bent restriction fragments [9]. Our study is particularly timely given the recent data which reveal that crystal packing forces play a major role in determining the intrinsic bend of DNA molecules in the solid state [12]. We discuss the conformation of d(AAAACGTTTT) 2 in the light of the proposed models for DNA bending and, to this end, we have used a variety of phase-sensitive two-dimensional (2D) NMR experiments to assign all but the H 5 ' / H 5 " sugar resonances. Analysis of the magnitude of the scalar coupling interactions from a combination of 1D and high-resolution 2D NMR spectra has enabled us to determine the conformational domain of the ten nonequivalent deoxyribose rings as well as to deduce some aspects of their conformational dynamics: this is information not readily available from crystal structure data at typical resolutions. Several lines of evidence indicate that the conformation of the sugar phosphate backbone in the oligo(dA) strand is different to the conformation of the backbone of the oligo(dT) strand. Analysis of the pattern and intensity of cross-peaks in NOESY spectra reveal a number of conformational features which suggest that the adenine tract is highly propellor-twisted and that there are abrupt conformational changes at the 5'-ApC and 5'-GpT junctions. The data suggest that these latter conformational changes may involve slide and roll dislocations.
Materials and Methods

10 /~mol of the decadeoxynucleoside nonaphosphate d(AAAACGTTTT) was synthesized using solid-phase phosphoramidite chemistry on an Applied Biosystems model 381A DNA synthesizer. After cleavage and deblocking the oligonucleotide was purified using reversephase HPLC in a two-step procedure initially with the trityl protecting group on, followed by deprotection and further purification. For NMR studies the sample was lyophilized several times from a D20 solution and was finally dissolved in 0.6 ml of D20 containing 10 mM phosphate buffer and 50 mM NaC1 at pH 7.0. 1H-NMR spectra were collected at 400 MHz on a Varian VXR400/WB spectrometer and the data processed on a Sun 3/50 work station. Pure absorption phase-sensitive DQF-COSY, NOESY and HOHAHA spectra were obtained using the hypercomplex method of data collection [16,17] with the carrier frequency placed at the centre of the spectrum. A spectral width of 3500 Hz was employed with a relaxation delay of 1.5-1.8 s incorporated into each pulse sequence. The DQF-COSY spectrum was acquired as 2048 complex points in t 2 for 512 t 1 increments and was zero-filled to a 4096 × 2048 matrix prior to Fourier transformation. NOESY spectra (mixing times 70, 110 and 200 ms) and HOHAHA spectra (mixing times 69, 110 and 148 ms) were acquired as 1024 points in t 2 for 300-400 t 1 increments and zero-filled to 1024 points in t 1 prior transformation. All data were apodized with sinebell and/or shifted-sinebell window functions. Nucleotides are numbered sequentially from the 5'-end of the decamer, viz., d(A1A2-A3-A4-C5-G6-T7-T8-T9-T10).
Results

The nonexchangeable proton resonances of d(AAAACGTI'TT)2 have been assigned using well established procedures [18-22]. First, direct and relayed throughbond correlations within the Hl'-H2'/2"-H3'-H4' spin-systems of the ten nonequivalent deoxyribose rings and between base H5-H6 and CH3-H6 have been established from an analysis of DQF-COSY and HOHAHA spectra. Second, sequential assignments have been determined on the basis of through-space interac-

71 tions observed in NOESY spectra. The pattern and magnitude of these latter interactions enables us to conclude that the overall conformation is characteristic of the B-type family of structures [23]. A number of independent sequential assignment pathways were used to confirm the right-handed nature of the duplex and ensure that resonances are assigned unambiguously. are either very weak or not observed at all. The general pattern and ratio of NOE intensities found (HI'-H2" > HI'-H2' and H2'-H3' > H2"-H3') are characteristic of sugar geometries within the 'S' domain. A particularly notable feature of Fig.1 is the presence of intense H2'-H3' COSY cross-peaks but the complete absence of correlations corresponding to H2"-H3' for all but the 3'-terminal residue in the sequence. Given the relationship between cross-peak intensity and the magnitude of the active coupling [24] we conclude that the H2"-H3' coupling is particularly weak (< 2 Hz) in nine out of the ten cases. In view of the limited resolution of the H3' resonances in the 4.4-5.0 ppm region of the spectrum assignments were confirmed by the observation of all ten HI'-H3' as well as a number of HI'-H4' correlations in the portion of the HOHAHA spectrum illustrated in Fig. 2. The absence of all purine nucleotide HI'-H4' correlations from Fig. 2 is discussed in greater detail below. The remaining H4' and some H 5 ' / 5 " resonances are assigned on the basis of further correlations observed in DQF-COSY and HOHAHA spectra (data not shown), with all assignments being confirmed by NOESY data (see Fig. 3).

Spin-system identification
Resonance assignments within the spin-systems of the ten deoxyribose rings were made primarily from an analysis of DQF-COSY spectra, Fig. 1 illustrating cross-peaks for HI'-H2', HI'-H2" and H2'-H3'. We choose to distinguish H2' from H2" resonances by comparison of HI'-H2' and HI'-H2" cross-peak intensities in NOESY spectra rather than from cross-peak fine structure in phase-sensitive COSY spectra since the latter depend in a complex manner on deoxyribose geometry. By contrast, the interproton distances calculated for the full range of sugar puckers lead to the conclusion that a much stronger NOE is expected for HI'-H2" than for HI'-H2'. This readily permits unequivocal assignments to be made from an analysis of cross-peak intensities in the 70 ms NOESY spectra. We find it possible to distinguish all HI'-H2' from HI'-H2" correlations except for those associated with the 3'terminal thymine residue where the chemical shifts of H2' and H2" overlap. The HI'-H2" cross-peaks are readily resolved, while those corresponding to HI'-H2'

Sequential assignments
Three essentially independent sequential assignment pathways were considered on the basis of through-space intra and internucleotide interactions observed in NOESY spectra. The 200 ms NOESY spectrum re-

Both positive and negative contour levels are plotted without distinction. In all cases the H I ' - H 2 ' cross-peak of a particular nucleotide in (A) appears to high-field of that of its corresponding H I ' - H 2 " . The H2'-H3' and H 2 " - H 3 ' cross-peaks for C5 are not observed due to saturation of the HDO resonance which lies close by at 4.65 ppm. The different splitting patterns for the H2'-H3' cross-peaks of T9 and G6 are highlighted. The stimulated cross-peak fine-structure patterns predicted for the C2'-endo ( P = 162 o) and O4'-endo ( P = 90 ° ) sugar geometries, at a typical digital resolution of 1-2 Hz/point, are also illustrated. The values for the coupling constants used are those indicated in Table II. Open circles represent positive phase, closed circles negative phase.

corded at 13°C (see Fig. 3A) was used qualitatively to identify correlations of the type HI' ( i - 1)-H6/H8(i)HI'(i), H 2 ' / 2 " ( i - 1)-H6/H8(i)-H2'/2"(i) and H6/H8(i)-H5/CH3(i + 1). The first of these pathways is examined in greater detail in Fig. 3B. Beginning with the intranucleotide correlation AIH8-AIHI' (labelled A1-A1) the pattern is traced to the first sequential connection A1HI'-A2H8 (labelled A1-A2) and onward along the sequence· In Fig. 4 sequential assignments based upon the second pathway are considered in a semiquantitative approach using 70 ms NOESY data.

The observation of cross-peaks corresponding only to H6/H8(i)-H2'(i) and H6/H8(i)-H2" ( i - 1 ) in the majority of cases is a clear indication that d( AAACGTTTT)2 has, overall, a B-type DNA morphology [23]. We find that for a given base proton the intensities of these intra and internucleotide interactions vary significantly amongst the different nucleotides. In an idealised B-DNA conformation the corresponding interproton distances are identical ( - 2.2 ,~) giving rise to an intensity ratio for the corresponding NOEs of approximately 1.0.

Fig. 4. Selected region of the phase-sensitive NOESY spectrum of d(AAAACG'ITIT)2 recorded at 13° C, mixing time 70 ms. The right-hand portion of the figure contains HI'-H2' and HI'-H2"' correlations for each of the deoxyribose rings. The HI"-H2"' cross-peaks are strong, while those for HI'-H2' are weak or absent. Their positions in the DQF-COSY spectrum are highlighted by open circles. Correlations of the type H6/HS-H2'/H2" are illustrated to the left of the figure. Cross-peaks labelled 's' correspond to the sequential correlations H6/HS(i)-H2"/H2~' i_ 1).

NOESY spectrum reveals that this ratio is generally larger for the purine nucleotides than for the pyrimidines with several unique values being observed. For C5, TS, T9 and T10 the ratio lies between 1.0-1.5, while for the purines A1-A4 and G6 ratios > 2.0 are observed. Amongst the pyrimidines T7 is the exception were interresidue NOEs corresponding to H 6 ( i ) - H 2 ' ( i - 1 ) and H 6 ( i ) - H 2 " ( i - 1) are observed with similar intensities, both with inter to intraresidue intensity ratios of > 2.0. This observation suggests some degree of structural uniqueness for T7. The third of the sequential assignment pathways involves correlations of the type H 6 / H S ( i ) - H S / C H 3 ( i + 1) and provides an independent check on the assignments of the base protons derived from the base proton-sugar proton interactions. This procedure was useful in resolving ambiguities ap-

parent from the first two approaches that arose through overlap of the resonances T8H6 and T10H6. The fact that interresidue correlations of the type H 6 / H S H S / C H 3 occur only in the 5'-direction along the sequence further identifies the duplex as being righthanded. The assignment of the nonexchangeable resonances is completed by identifying the individual adenine H2s. Fig. 5A illustrates cross-peaks between these protons and a number of H I ' resonances corresponding to both intra and interstrand interactions. From the A4H2 resonance, for example, we observe NOESY cross-peaks to C5H1', T 7 H I ' and T 8 H I ' . Each AH2 gives a particularly strong N O E to the sugar H I ' of the complementary nucleotide to the 5'-neighbouring residue, with weak effects observed in some cases to both H l ' s of the

The AH2 assignments are confirmed by strong sequential NOEs of the type AH2(i)AH2(i + 1) for all but the A2H2-A3H2 step where poor resolution close to the diagonal obscures the cross-peak. All nonexchangeable proton chemical shifts that have been identified are listed in Table I.

Determination of sugar geometries
The deoxyribose ring gives rise to five vicinal scalar coupling interactions, the magnitudes of which are strongly dependent on sugar geometry. A quantitative estimation of a number of these scalar coupling constants permits the deoxyribose ring to be described, where appropriate, in terms of either a static conformation or as a rapid dynamic equilibrium between North (C3'-endo) and South (C2'-endo) conformers [25-27]. This approach to conformational analysis has found favour over the use of interproton distances determined from NOE data because of the problems associated with spin-diffusion amongst the deoxyribose ring protons and the insensitivity of the NOE to subtle changes in ring torsion angles. Inspection of the DQF-COSY data of Fig. 1 reveals clear differences in cross-peak

fine structure amongst the different nucleotides of d(AAAACGTTTT)2. We have analysed cross-peak splitting patterns where possible in high-resolution DQF-COSY spectra to determine the conformational domain of the ten deoxyribose sugar rings of d(AAAACGTTTT)2. Although the outer splittings of cross-peaks can be determined directly and accurately at the readily attainable digital resolution of 1 Hz/point to give an estimate of the sum of coupling constants, the small values encountered for the differences in coupling constants for some sugar rings leads to partial or complete cancellation of inner antiphase components making first-order determination of individual couplings impossible in some cases [25,26]. An alternative approach involves calculating splitting patterns for a range of sugar geometries and matching these with the experimental data [26,28,29]. Splitting patterns for a range of 'S' domain geometries were determined graphically for

75 pseudorotation angles in the range P = 90 ° to 162 °. We have also considered a fast two-state North-South conformational equilibrium. The analysis is aided by the fact that all H I ' sugar resonances are well resolved, as illustrated in Fig. 6, enabling J1'-2' and Jr-2" values to be determined directly from resolution enhanced 1D aH spectra. The H I ' resonance splitting patterns also clearly illustrate conformational differences between the ten nucleotide sugar rings. The resonance for A2, for example, is readily resolved into a doublet of doublets (9.7, 5.4 Hz) while that for C5 has the appearence of a pseudo triplet (7.7, 6.8 Hz). The data is summarized in Table II. The complete absence of H2"-H3' cross-peaks from the spectrum of Fig. 1, for all but T10, leads us to conclude that J2"-3' is small, < 2 Hz, in all cases and that this coupling serves only to add a line broadening component to H2" cross-peak fine structure. Fig. 1 illustrates the calculated fine structure for HI'-H2', H I ' - H 2 " and H2'-H3' cross-peaks for the t w o ' S ' domain geometries of C2'-endo and O4'-endo [28]. The splitting patterns observed for all the purines are consistent with deoxyribose ring conformations in the vicinity of the C2'-endo domain ( P = 1 4 0 - 1 8 0 ° ) . Small variations in J1'-2' and J1'-2" by up to 1 Hz amongst the purine deoxyribose rings (see Table II) are readily explained by considering a static deviation (_+ 20 °) from the pure C2'-endo geometry (P = 162,° ), or by invoking a dynamic contribution from a small proportion ( < 15 %) of the N-domain C3'-endo geometry. However, the data do not permit us to distinguish between these two possibilities. All the pyrimidine nucleotides have significantly larger values for J1'-2" than do the purines, and this difference in pyrimidine and purine sugar conformation is reflected in the fine structure of the H2'-H3' cross-peaks of Fig. 1. The splitting patterns for C5, T7 and T8 are consistent with a static deviation from the C2'-endo geometry, with P values in the range 90-130 ° (i.e., O4'-endo, Cl'-exo), but not with a dynamic model involving pure N and S geometries as the limiting structures. The sugar rings of T9 and T10 are not readily assigned to either a static geometry or a NorthSouth equilibrium with the values observed for Jl'-2' and J1'-2", in each case, lying close to 7.0 Hz. Given that T7 and T8 appear to have static geometries different from the C2'-endo configuration a more complex equilibrium may be required to explain the data for T9 and T10. The observed J values are, for example, satisfactorily explained by an O4'-endo/Cl'-exo -C2'endo equilibrium in which the C2'-endo geometry contributes 10-20% to the equilibrium. The magnitude of J3"-4', the fifth of the vicinal coupling constants to show significant conformation-dependence, has been estimated from the observation of multiple bond correlations in the 140 ms H O H A H A spectrum of Fig. 2. For sugar geometries in the range P = 140-180 o the value of J3'-4', is predicted to be close to zero but as P decreases the value of J3".4' increases, for example, to > 5 Hz for the O4'-endo geometry (P = 90 o) [26]. This difference is expected to have a considerable effect on correlations mediated by J3'.4'. In Fig. 2 cross-peaks corresponding to H I ' - H 4 ' are observed for all of the pyrimidines and are particularly strong for C5. Similarly, strong H 2 ' / H 2 " - H 4 ' correlations are also found for these nucleotides (data not shown). By contrast, none of the purine nucleotides show either set of cross-peaks, an observation consistent with moderate to large values of J3'-4' for the pyrimidine nucleotides and sugar geometries markedly different from the classical C2'-endo puckers observed here for the purines.
Discussion

The pattern and intensity of both inter and intranucleotide NOESY cross-peaks in the spectra of d(AAAACGTITF)2 are consistent with a solution conformation within the broad family of B-type DNA [23]. Many unique features, however, distinguish it from the B - D N A fibre diffraction structure of Arnott (see Ref. 30), the data being more compatible with the distorted single crystal structures reported recently for other DNAs containing adenine tracts [11,12,31]. In the NOESY spectra of d(AAAACGTTTTT)2 we observe strong interstrand NOEs between all adenine H2 resonances and the sugar H I ' of the complementary nucleotide to the 5'-neighbouring residue. The intensities of these cross-peaks, which are comparable to those of the H 6 / H 8 - H I ' correlations (see Fig. 5B), indicate proton-proton separations in the range 3.5-4.0 ,~. These distances are consistent with all A-T basepairs being highly propeller twisted, as observed in the crystal structure of d(CGCAAAAAACGC) [11], but not with the structure of standard B-DNA where such distances lie outside the NOE-observable range ( > 5.0 A). The pattern of NOEs also clearly defines the direction of propeller-twisting as tilting the purine bases towards the 5'-end of the sequence in the minor groove. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the correlation from A4H2 to T8HI' is the strongest of all the interstrand NOEs that we observe indicating that the propeller-twisting of the A4-T7 basepair is not flattened out at the purinepyrimidine (5'-ApC) step at the end of the tract. Moreover, the data are consistent with a compression of the minor groove of the adenine tract with the narrowest region being located at the 3'-end of the sequence. Similar observations have been reported for d(CGCAAAAAAGCG) and its complement in solution [32], and are consistent with the phosphodiester bond cleavage patterns of runs of adenines observed using hydroxyl radicals [33].

76 Several lines of evidence reveal that the conformation of the sugar-phosphate backbone of the oligo(dA) strand is different to that of the oligo(dT) strand. The DQFCOSY and H O H A H A data indicate that the sugar rings of the adenines have essentially C2'-endo geometries, whereas the complementary thymine nucleotides show significant distortions aways from this configuration centering on O4'-endo/Cl'-exo. The conformation of the A and T sugar rings within the adenine tract are thus quite different and suggestive of a mildly heteronomous structure. Although the ring puckers of A1, T9 and T10 show dynamic variations, which for the most part seem to relate to their positions at or close to the ends of the duplex, the data affirm that the A and T nucleotides also have different predominant conformations in the terminal A1-T10 and A2-T9 basepairs. The 70 ms NOESY data adds further weight to the belief that the oligo(dA) and oligo(dT) strands are dissimilar, since the ratio of the intensities of H6/H8(i)-H2'(i) and H6/HS(i)-H2"(i-1) cross-peaks is generally larger for the purine than for the pyrimidine nucleotides within the tract. Turning attention to the conformation at the junction between the adenine tract and the adjacent C-G basepair we observe abrupt changes in sugar geometries at the 5'-ApC and 5'-GpT steps. The pucker of the C5 deoxyribose ring shows the most marked deviation from the classical C2'-endo configuration of all of the sugar rings, while the G6 sugar adopts a predominantly C2'endo geometry similar to that found for the adenines. A number of peculiar 1H chemical shift values also point to modified stacking interactions at the 5'-ApC step. For example, the HI', H2' and H 2 " resonances of C5 experience pronounced upfield perturbations to their chemical shifts compared to those of the other pyrimidine nucleotides in the sequence. This break in conformation at the 3'-end of the adenine tract accords with the findings of Koo et al. [4] that imply that the 3'-terminus is the important locus for bending. However, we note that similar modifications to the chemical shifts of H I ' resonances in the residue immediately 5' to the adenine tract have been reported for duplexes containing the sequences d(CGAAAAATCGG) [34] and d(CGCAAAAAAGCG) [32] with the authors in both cases also suggesting DNA bending as the source of the perturbation. In d(AAAACGTTTT) 2 the A4H2 suffers a particularly large downfield shift, resonating 0.4 ppm to lowerfield than the H2 of either A3 or A2, while the resonance from T7CH 3 appears > 0.35 ppm upfield of those of T8, T9 and T10. It should of course be remembered that the ring current shifts experienced by the aromatic and methyl protons of A4 and T7 are intrinsically different to those experienced by the protons of the other A-T basepairs as a consequence of the participitation of A4 and T7 in the purine-(3',5')-pyrimidine step. More definitive evidence for conformational heterogeneity at the 5'-ApC dinucleotide is provided by the presence of a particularly intense intrastrand NOE from A4H2 to C5HI', other H2(i) to H I ' ( i + 1) NOEs being noticeably weak. We rationalise the intensity of this NOE by proposing that the C5-G6 basepairs slides over the A4-T7 basepair in the direction that pulls the G6 nucleotide out of the helical stack. This dislocation of the structure also results in greater overlap between the A4 purine base and the C5 sugar protons which further accounts for the unusual ring current shifts observed for the C5 HI', H2' and H 2 " resonances. Other atypical aspects of the structure relate to the intensity of inter and intranucleotide NOE cross-peaks between H 6 / H 8 and HI'. The intensities of these cross-peaks in an idealized B-DNA structure are expected to be very similar corresoponding to interproton distances in the range 3.6-3.8 A [30]. However, at the shortest mixing times at which these NOEs are observed (70 and 110 ms, data not shown) the measured intensities vary widely. The intranucleotide interactions, which define the glycosidic bond angle, are strong in the case of C5 but particularly weak for A4 and G6, suggesting a high anti-configuration for the latter residues. The N M R data presented here lead us to conclude that many of the structural characteristics of adenine tracts observed in the crystalline from [11,12] are also present in solution, at least for d(AAAACGTTTT) 2. Our data, however, further imply that some degree of conformational distinction exists between the sugarphosphate chains of the oligo(dA) and oligo(dT) strands of the adenine tract, a notion that has also been alluded to recently by Celda et al. [26] in their solution N M R studies of d(AAAAATTTTT) 2. The abrupt changes in sugar conformation that occur at the 5'-ApC step, together with the many modifications to the pattern of internucleotide NOEs at this site, suggests to us that a junction model best describes the conformation of d(AAAACGTTTT)2 in solution, although no single set of NOEs unambiguously point to bending at the 5'-ApC locus. Currently, it is still uncertain in the 'junction bend model' whether the adenine tract-induced bend is localised at the junction with 'regular' B-DNA sequences as a consequence of a large roll angle at this point, or whether the bend is distributed more smoothly over the tract and its flanking regions [4,35]. The former notion finds some support in the adenine tract crystal structure of Nelson et al. [11] where large roll angles of - 1 0 ° are observed for the basepairs at the junction and for those which flank the adenine sequence. For d(AAAACGTTTT)2 in solution, a large roll angle is strongly implicated at the 5'-ApC junction between the A4-T7 and C5-G6 basepairs as a consequence of the particularly large propeller twist angle observed for A4-T7. In such a case opening the 5'-ApC step into the major groove, as proposed in the kinematic model of DNA [36], would relieve the resultant steric clashes

77 between the purines bases of A4 and G6 on opposing strands and so provide a nucleation site for bending the helix axis. Whilst sliding of the A4-T7 and C5-G6 basepairs with respect to each other alone may also relieve potentially unfavourable contacts, our data are most consistent with the view that the conformational dislocation at the 5'-ApC junction results from a combination of slide and roll manoeuvres.
