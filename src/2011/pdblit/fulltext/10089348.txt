Structure determination of rubredoxin from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F in two crystal forms
The structures of two crystal forms (form I, P3221, a = b = 43.7, Ê Ê c = 50.7 A; form II, P21, a = 27.3, b = 44.9, c = 51.2 A and  = 90.6 ) of the rubredoxin from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F have been solved by the molecular-replacement Ê method. Form I has been re®ned at a resolution of 2.0 A to an R value of 20.8% and includes 32 water molecules. Form II Ê includes 86 water molecules and has been re®ned at 1.9 A resolution to an R value of 17.5%. In form II, there are three molecules in the asymmetric unit with the molecules related by a non-crystallographic 32 symmetry axis. In both crystal forms, it was found that only a few residues effectively participate in the formation of intermolecular contacts along both the crystallographic (form I) and the non-crystallographic (form II) 32 axes. The crystal structure of the form II crystal is compared with those of other rubredoxin molecules from anaerobic bacteria. From this comparison, a similarity in the core region, which is composed of aromatic residues and includes the active centre, has been revealed.

1. Introduction
Rubredoxins and ferredoxins are known as non-haem iron proteins which function as electron carriers for the various enzymes. In ferredoxins, Fe atoms along with two or four labile S atoms form a cluster, whereas in rubredoxins only a single Fe atom is simply coordinated by four S atoms from cysteine residues. There have been two reports which describe the possible electron-transfer partners for rubredoxin molecules. The rubredoxin from Pseudomonas oleovorans has been implicated in the electron-transfer pathway for the 3-hydroxylation of alkanes and fatty acids in the presence of NADH and O2 (Peterson & Coon, 1968), whereas the rubredoxin from Desulfovibrio gigas was reported to act as an electron donor to a ¯avohaemoprotein, rubredoxin±oxygen oxidoreductase (Chen et al., 1993). In contrast, the physiological role of the rubredoxins from other sulfate-reducing bacteria has not yet been elucidated. The rubredoxin from D. vulgaris Miyazaki F (RdDvMF) has been reported to have a role as an electron acceptor for the intracellular lactate dehydrogenase in collaboration with naphthoquinone. In this reaction, an electron extracted from lactate would be transferred to the network of electron-carrier proteins to effect electron-transfer-coupled phosphorylation (Shimizu et al., 1989). RdDvMF is composed of 52 amino-acid residues and is highly homologous to the rubredoxin from D. vulgaris Hildenborough (RdDvH; Bruschi, 1976a). In order to establish the role of the invariant and/or variant residues between RdDvH and RdDvMF, and the universal relationships between the function and the structure of the rubredoxin

2. Methods and materials
2.1. Data collection and processing

The rubredoxin was extracted and puri®ed according to the method previously described (Shimizu et al., 1989). The crystals were grown in two crystal forms (form I, P3221 with unitÊ cell dimensions of a = b = 43.7, c = 50.7 A; form II, P21 with Ê and  = 90.6 ; Higuchi et al., 1998). a = 27.3, b = 44.9, c = 51.2 A X-ray data collection was carried out with a Weissenberg camera for macromolecular crystallography using synchrotron Ê radiation of wavelength 1.00 A on two beamlines (BL-6A and BL-18B) at the Photon Factory of the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics in Tsukuba, Japan. Diffraction data were collected from a single crystal for form I and from three crystals for form II. Diffraction patterns were recorded on Fuji imaging plates and scanned images were obtained using a BA-100 system. The intensity data were processed using the WEIS (Higashi, 1989) and PROTEIN (Steigemann, 1992) program packages for the form I crystal and using the DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993) for the form II crystal. The data-processing statistics are shown in Table 1.
2.2. Structure determination

The structure of the form I crystal was solved by the molecular-replacement method using the X-PLOR program È package (Brunger, 1992a). Molecular replacement was ®rst implemented for form I because the number of molecules in the asymmetric unit was expected to be one from its crystal Ê data. The atomic coordinates of RdDvH reported at 1.5 A resolution in the Protein Data Bank were used as a starting

model (Adman et al., 1991). The initial R value for the molecular-replacement solution obtained from the crossrotation and translation search was 43.4%, using 941 re¯ecÊ tions in the 6±3 A resolution range. This R value is about 10% lower than those of the other possible solutions. Following rigid-body re®nement, the R value decreased to 39.4% and side-chain atoms were ®tted into the 2|Fo| À |Fc| electrondensity map. The structure was further re®ned to an R value of Ê 24.3% (2066 re¯ections in the resolution range 6±2.5 A) using the simulated-annealing method implemented in X-PLOR. After the placement and re®nement of 32 water molecules, the R value was reduced to 20.8% (2541 re¯ections in the resoÊ lution range 6±2.0 A). The resulting structure determined for form I was used as a molecular-replacement model in the determination of the form II crystal structure. The self-rotation function for form II suggested that the crystal contained three molecules in the asymmetric unit. One of the three molecules in the asymmetric unit was easily positioned from a rotation and translation search. The remaining two molecules were successively located in 2|Fo| À |Fc| electron-density maps calculated with phases obtained from the previously positioned molecules. These three molecules were re®ned independently without imposing non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. The initial R values following the placement of one, two and all three molecules in the asymmetric unit were 49.6, 42.0 and 34.5%, respectively. The R value converged to 17.4% Ê (6.0±1.9 A, 9604 re¯ections) with the inclusion of 86 water molecules. The structure-determination statistics are listed in Table 1.

This pseudo 32 symmetry was deduced from both form I and form II was veri®ed using the program the intensity pattern of the low-resolution re¯ections along the PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), which showed quite c* axis. The r.m.s. deviations for all protein atoms between favourable agreement with known stereochemical properties each pair of crystallographically independent molecules in two of proteins (Table 2). B factors of the protein atoms and rootcrystal forms of RdDvMF (that is, one molecule in form I and mean-square Á of B factors for bonded atoms also converged three molecules in form II) range between Ê 0.7 and 1.0 A (Table 3). This indicates that the three-dimensional structures are very similar for all the crystallographically independent molecules, even though there are quite striking differences between the crystal packing of the two crystal forms. In addition, the set of three molecules related by crystallographic 32 symmetry in the form I crystal can be superimposed onto the three molecules in the form II crystal which are related by the non-crystallographic 32 Ê symmetry, with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.94 A for all protein atoms. However, owing to the existence of additional crystallographic symmetry elements as well as the differences in the shape and size of the two crystal unit cells, both forms show unique crystalpacking structures. As a consequence, form I contains a large solvent cavity which contributes to a larger solvent content of 51% for form I versus 34% for form II (Figs. 2a and 2b). This is likely to contribute to the enhanced diffraction of form II compared Figure 1 A stereoview along the b axis showing non-crystallographic 32 symmetry-related rubredoxin with form I (Table 1).

bacteria. As a consequence of the similarity of the amino-acid sequence, the r.m.s. deviations for main-chain atoms between the known structures of rubredoxin, RdDvMF, RdDvH, RdDg from Desulfovibrio gigas (Frey et al., 1987), RdPf from Pyrococcus furiosus (Day et al., 1992), RdCp from Clostridium pasteurianum (Watenpaugh et al., 1973) and RdDd from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans strain 27774 (Stenkamp et al., Ê 1990) are all within 1.0 A (Table 3). The degrees of similarity in both the overall folding pattern and the primary sequence are very high, with the exception of RdDd, which has a deletion in the site corresponding to the short loop Asp19± Lys25 in RdDvMF. The sequence identities between three rubredoxin molecules from sulfate-reducing bacteria, RdDvMF, RdDvH and RdDg (Bruschi, 1976b) are calculated to be 90.4% (RdDvMF± RdDvH), 71.2% (RdDvMF±RdDg), and 73.1% (RdDvH± RdDg). From a comparison between RdDvMF and RdDvH, only ®ve amino-acid substitutions were found (Fig. 3). Four of these substitutions, Ala29 (Ser29), Glu31 (Asp31), Ile41 (Val41) and Pro51 (Ala51) in RdDvMF (RdDvH) are located at the molecular surface, but Val33 (Leu33) is directed toward the core region of the molecule and is surrounded by aromatic side chains. The side chain of a valine residue is smaller than that of a leucine residue, therefore Val33 can be located in this position without signi®cant steric hindrance. However, the crystal packing of RdDvMF is different to that of RdDvH, even though both proteins show high sequence similarities and three-dimensional structural similarities. Crystals of RdDvH belong to the space group P21, which is the same as that of the form I crystal of RdDvMF, but non-crystallographic 32 symmetry does not exist in the RdDvH asymmetric unit. One interesting point is the relationship between RdDvH and RdDg. Though the sequence homology between RdDvH and RdDg is much lower than that between RdDvH and RdDvMF, RdDvH and RdDg exhibit common crystallographic and structural features, such as the space group of the crystal, unitcell dimensions, molecular packing and the overall folding pattern. From a careful examination of the three-dimensional structures of RdDvMF molecules in both crystal forms I and II, two types of interactions, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, predominate along the interface between the three molecules related either by a real or a pseudo 32 symmetry axis (Table 4). The side-chain atoms of three substituted residues, Glu31, Ile41 and Pro51 make strong hydrophobic interactions with the side-chain and/or mainchain atoms of Tyr11, Asp21, Pro40, Ile41 and Cys42 of the neighbouring molecules. Among them, Ile41 C and Pro51 C effectively lie along the real or the pseudo 32 symmetry axis. On the other hand, the side-chain atoms of Glu31 participate in the hydrogen-bonding network between 32 symmetry-related molecules and water molecules. Since the amino-acid substitution of the aspartate in RdDvH by the glutamate in RdDvMF at position 31 seems to have little effect on the surface structure of the molecule and most of the hydrogen bonds involve water molecules, the hydrophobic interactions involving the substituted amino acids (Ile41 and Pro51) serve the primary role in preserving the 32 symmetry in both the crystal structures. Lys46, which participates in the hydrophilic interaction between neighbouring molecules (Table 4), is known to be one of the most strictly conserved residues among all rubredoxins (Fig. 3). The side-chain N atom of the lysine residue also forms intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl O atoms of Phe30 and Val33. These two intramolecular hydrogen bonds also exist in other rubredoxins. As pointed out previously, this Lys46 seems to have a role in stabilizing the three-dimensional structure of the molecule (Sieker et al., 1994).

cysteine residues Cys6, Cys9, Cys39 and Cys42. The distances between the ligand S atoms and Ê the Fe atom are in the range 2.29±2.33 A. They are similar to the average values of the FeÐS Ê distances (2.29 A) found in other rubredoxins, but shorter than the ZnÐS bond length Ê (2.35 A) in the Zn-substituted rubredoxin (Dauter et al., 1996). There are no signi®cant differences in the coordination geometry among the four RdDvMF molecules (three molecules related by the non-crystallographic 32 symmetry in form II and one molecule in form I). The lengths of hydrogen bonds between the S atoms of the ith ligand cysteine residues and the peptide N atoms of the (i + 2)nd or (i + 3)rd residues in the four RdDvMF molecules in forms I and II range Ê from 3.40 to 3.69 A. Within a single RdDvMF molecule, no special features such as a twofold symmetry relationship between the bond lengths of the hydrogen bonds (S ÐHÐN) can be found. Since the structure around the Fe atom (not only the Fe atom and coordinated cysteine S atoms, but also the peptide N atoms which hydrogen bond to the S atoms) is quite highly conserved among all the known rubredoxin structures, this region of the rubredoxin molecule is likely to be essential for function.

The conserved aromatic residues, the coordinated four cysteine residues and every ®ve residues are numbered with a one-letter code.

Main-chain atoms are coloured grey and the Fe atom is shown as a purple sphere. The ®gure was produced using the programs MOLSCRIPT and RASTER3D (Kraulis, 1991; Merritt & Murphy, 1994).

Five conserved aromatic residues, Tyr4, Tyr13, Trp37 and Phe49, are located within the hydrophobic core of the structure near the active centre (Fig. 4). Though Tyr4 of RdDvMF is not strictly conserved in other rubredoxins (Fig. 3), all of the known rubredoxins have an aromatic residue at this position in the sequence. This conservation of aromatic residues is involved in the formation of a shape similar to the so-called `donut' structure, and this shape should be essential for the function of rubredoxin molecules. The Fe atom itself is surrounded by ±Cys6±Thr±Val±Cys9± and ±Cys39±Pro±Ile±Cys42±. These turn regions also surround the Fe atoms in other rubredoxin structures. Therefore, the Fe atom is not directly accessible from the surface of the molecule (Watenpaugh et al., 1980). Since the two coordinated cysteine residues (Cys6 and Ê Cys39) are located within 4.0 A of the two of the aromatic residues (Phe49 and Tyr11), it is possible to form an interaction between the Fe atom and these aromatic two residues. This central core part composed of the aromatic residues is accessible from both sides of the molecule (Fig. 4). It is proposed that one side of
