S100A12 is a member of the S100 subfamily of EF-hand calcium-binding proteins; it has been shown to be one of the ligands of the `receptor for advanced glycation end products' (RAGE) that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is involved in diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, in¯ammation and tumour invasion. The structure of the dimeric form of native S100A12 from human granulocytes in the presence of calcium in space group R3 has previously been reported. Here, the structure of a second crystal form in space group P21 (unit-cell Ê parameters a = 53.9, b = 100.5, c = 112.7 A,  = 94.6 ) solved at Ê resolution by molecular replacement using the R3 2.7 A structure as a search model is reported. Like most S100 proteins, S100A12 is a dimer. However, in the P21 crystal form dimers of S100A12 are arranged in a spherical hexameric Ê assembly with an external diameter of about 55 A stabilized by calcium ions bound between adjacent dimers. The putative target-binding sites of S100A12 are located at the outer surface of the hexamer, making it possible for the hexamer to bind several targets. It is proposed that the S100A12 hexameric assembly might interact with three extracellular domains of the receptor, bringing them together into large trimeric assemblies.

1. Introduction
The S100 protein family is made up of calcium-modulated proteins of the EF-hand type with diverse functional roles in cell differentiation and migration (reviewed in Donato, 2001; È Heizmann & Cox, 1998; Schafer & Heizmann, 1996; Kligman & Hilt, 1988). Most S100 family members were isolated from cells in the form of dimers. The dimers have two target-binding sites, with both subunits contributing to each of them. The target-binding sites are located on opposite sides of the dimer, creating the possibility that S100 proteins might functionally cross-bridge two similar or even different target proteins. S100 proteins have both intracellular and extracellular functions. The mechanism of secretion of S100 proteins is still unclear, but the ®rst data have started to emerge. Recent reports on S100A13 show that it is released in a Cu2+-dependent complex with ®broblast growth factor 1 (Landriscina, Bagala et al., 2001; Landriscina, Soldi et al., 2001). Similar secretion mechanisms could work for other S100 proteins. There is increasing evidence that secreted S100 proteins are able to Â form oligomers (Rety et al., 1999; Strupat et al., 2000). Moreover, it has been shown that S100A4 oligomers have enhanced biological activity in stimulating angiogenesis (Ambartsumian et al., 2001) and neurite outgrowth (Novitskaya et al., 2000). Human S100A12 is a member of the calgranulin subfamily (Guignard et al., 1995). It is expressed exclusively in

granulocytes (Vogl et al., 1999), while two other calgranulins S100A8 and S100A9 are more widely expressed. Recent data indicate that while the two other calgranulins interact with each other, forming heterodimers and heterotetramers (Strupat et al., 2000), S100A12 does not interact with either S100A8 or A9 or the A8/A9 complex (Vogl et al., 1999). It therefore probably plays a different role in calcium-induced signalling (Robinson & Hogg, 2000). Human S100A12 has 70% sequence identity with both pig (Dell'Angelica et al., 1994; Nonato et al., 1997) and rabbit S100A12 (Yan et al., 1996) and 78% with the bovine (Hitomi et al., 1996) protein. It is very likely that S100A12, as well as some other S100 proteins, belongs to a new class of chemokines and contributes to cell migration (Miranda et al., 2001). Involvement of S100A12 in chronic in¯ammatory responses has been reported: for example, during human onchocerciasis (Marti et al., 1996), in monocyte migration and in rheumatoid arthritis (Yang et al., 2001). In addition to the calcium sites, a single Zn2+-binding site per monomer was identi®ed in pig S100A12 by means of ¯uorimetric titration (Dell'Angelica et al., 1994). Following this, sequence analysis of human and pig S100A12 as well as human S100A8 and A9 showed the presence of an HxxxH Zn-binding motif close to the C-terminus (Marti et al., 1996). The Zn-binding site was more fully characterized from the three-dimensional structure of the homologous S100A7 zinc complex (Brodersen et al., 1999) and was shown to contain an additional His and a Glu from the N-terminus. Furthermore, there is evidence that some S100 family members can also bind copper and that Zn2+ and Cu2+ share the same binding site (Nishikawa et al., 1997; Heizmann & Cox, 1998), although for S100A5 it was alternatively suggested that copper might È substitute Ca2+ in the EF-hands (Schafer et al., 2000). A cell-surface receptor for S100A12, the `receptor for advanced glycation end products' (RAGE), has been identi®ed on endothelium, in¯ammatory cells and neurons. Interaction of RAGE with S100A12 mediates a novel proin¯ammatory axis (Hofmann et al., 1999). RAGE is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell-surface receptors (Springer, 1990; Harpaz & Chothia, 1994). It had ®rst been discovered as the receptor for the advanced glycation end products that form at an accelerated rate in diabetes (Neeper et al., 1992). Increased expression of RAGE in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue indicates that it is relevant to the pathogenesis of neuronal disfunction and death (Yan et al., 1996). RAGE binds amphoterin and mediates neurite outgrowth (Huttunen et al., 1999), while blockage of RAGE±amphoterin signalling decreases tumour growth and metastases (Taguchi et al., 2000). The immunoglobulin superfamily of receptors is closely related to the cytokine receptor superfamily; they are both thought to be derived from the same ancestor: a primitive celladhesion molecule (Bazan, 1990). There is increasing evidence of receptor oligomerization as a general mechanism for signal propagation by the cytokine family receptors (reviewed in Bravo & Heath, 2000). Receptor oligomerization is a mechanism during which an oligomeric ligand interacts with

two or more receptor extracellular domains. This interaction may change the conformation of the cytoplasmic domains, thus activating intracellular signalling. For the cytokine superfamily it is usually thought to be receptor dimerization, but the X-ray studies of the human interferon- receptor complex revealed a third receptor molecule which is possibly functionally signi®cant (Thiel et al., 2000). In the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, receptor trimerization is now con®rmed as a signalling mechanism. Signalling starts when a trimer of TNF binds to the extracellular domains of three receptor molecules (Banner et al., 1993; Naismith et al., 1996), which permits the aggregation and activation of three cytoplasmic domains that bind to a trimer of tumour necrosis receptor associated factor (TRAF) (Park et al., 1999; McWhirter et al., 1999; Ye et al., 1999; Ni et al., 2000; Wajant et al., 2001). We report here the structure of a S100A12 hexamer and propose a role of the hexameric assembly in RAGE-mediated signalling.

2. Methods
2.1. Crystallization and data collection

S100A12 was puri®ed from human granulocytes as described previously (Moroz et al., 2000) and crystallized by hanging-drop vapour diffusion with 4±7 mg mlÀ1 protein in a 1 ml drop and 10±20% PEG 5000 MME, 0.2 M CaCl2 and 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.5 in the reservoir. Crystallization conditions were similar to those for the R3 crystal form. Crystals belong to the space group P21, with unit-cell Ê parameters a = 53.9, b = 100.5, c = 112.7 A,  = 94.6 . The crystals were characterized using Cu K X-rays from a Rigaku RU-200 rotating-anode generator. There are 12 subunits of S100A12 in the asymmetric unit, resulting in a speci®c volume Ê VM of 2.43 A3 DaÀ1 and a solvent content of 48.9%. Ê Complete data were collected to 2.7 A resolution using synchrotron radiation at the ESRF beamline 14-4 (wavelength Ê 0.93 A). The data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). 85 375 re¯ections were reduced to 32 446 unique observations, giving an

Crystallographic calculations were performed using the CCP4 program package (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The structure was solved by molecular replacement with AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) using the structure of the S100A12 dimer from the R3 crystal form as a search model. Five solutions were found. The position of the sixth dimer, which is less ordered, was con®rmed using the FFFEAR program (Cowtan, 1998), which can search for molecular fragments in poor-quality electron-density maps. The solvent content was set to 55% and the search step to 5 . The structure was re®ned using REFMAC (Murshudov & Dodson, 1997). Initially, each monomer was treated as a rigid body. After convergence of rigid-body re®nement, individual atomic re®nement was conducted with NCS restraints (tight restraints for the main chain, loose restraints for the side chains). The resulting map was averaged with MAPROT and manual model rebuilding was performed using the XFIT (Old®eld, 1994) option of the program QUANTA (Molecular Simulations Inc.). For further re®nement, the TLS option (Schomaker & Trueblood, 1968; Winn et al., 2001) was used to account for the overall anisotropic motion of the monomers. From this stage, model rebuilding was performed individually for each subunit. The results of re®nement are summarized in Table 2.

The model contains 8514 atoms including 36 Ca atoms and 28 water molecules. All residues are in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965), with 91.6% in the most favoured regions (Fig. 1).

2.4. Dynamic light-scattering analysis

Dynamic light-scattering analysis (DLS) was carried out using a Dynapro-801 molecular-sizing instrument. A 20 ml sample with a protein concentration of 4 mg mlÀ1 was centrifuged at 14 000 rev minÀ1 for 10 min and transferred into a 20 ml chamber quartz cuvette. The data were analysed using the Dynamics 4.0 and DynaLS software (Protein Solutions).

Full-size RAGE cDNA was ampli®ed from the Marathon human lung cDNA library (Clontech) using an Advantage2 PCR kit (Clontech). A RAGE extracellular fragment bearing the putative S100-binding site was cloned into the pVL1392 vector and expressed in Sf21 insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. Expressed protein was puri®ed on a Bio-Rex70 cation-exchange column (Bio-Rad) and a RESOURCES cation-exchange column (Pharmacia). Finally, the protein was concentrated to 0.2 mg mlÀ1 using a Filtron 10K ultra®ltration membrane. The puri®cation procedure for recombinant S100A12 was similar to that for S100A4 described in Tarabykina et al. (2001).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. The S100A12 hexamer

The hexamer is arranged as a trimer of dimers, with each dimer having similar architecture and structure to that of a

The `EF-hand' calciums are bright yellow and the calciums in the hexamer-forming interface are dark yellow. This ®gure and Fig. 4 were generated using the program MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991).

dimer in the R3 crystal form (Moroz et al., 2001). The overall Ê surface of the hexamer is 22 426 A2, with a total area of Ê contact between the monomers of 6118 A2 and an area of Ê 2. The area of contact contact between the dimers of 2026 A here was de®ned as Scontact = (n Â Smon À Sn-mer)/2, where Smon is the area of a monomer and Sn-mer is the area of the n-fold oligomer. The approximate diameter of the hexamer is Ê Ê 55 A; the diameter of the central hole is about 8±10 A. The structures of the 12 crystallographically independent monomers in the asymmetric unit are essentially the same, with the signi®cant differences mainly restricted to a few side chains. The root-mean-square deviations in the main-chain atom positions (r.m.s.xyz) between subunit A and the other 11 subunits (B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L) and the average B factors for each chain are shown in Table 3. In the hexamer structure there is a further bound Ca2+ ion per monomer in addition to the two in the EF-hands. The additional calcium ions are coordinated by the residues from two adjacent dimers, and cause the dimers to associate into hexamers (Fig. 2). There is a total of six of these calcium ions per hexamer, in addition to the 12 `canonical' calciums bound to EF-hand motifs. The ability of S100A12 to bind additional calcium agrees well with the results of electrospray ionization mass-spectrometry analysis (Strupat et al., 2000). We have con®rmed S100A12 oligomerization in solution in the presence of calcium by DLS data, which show an increase of the hydrodynamic radius from 1.9 to 2.9 nm in the presence of 5 mM calcium. This would correspond to an increase in the molecular weight from 18 to 52 kDa assuming the standard settings for the molecular-weight estimate, in good agreement with the molecular weights of the S100A12 dimer (20.9 kDa) and hexamer, respectively. When the calcium concentration is increased to 200 mM, as in the crystallization buffer, the RH decreased to 2.4 nm. This probably means that the dissociation of some hexamers into dimers occurs at such high calcium concentrations and explains the existence of two crystal forms under the same conditions. The inter-dimer calcium ion is coordinated by the side-chain O atoms of Gln58 and Gln64 from the subunit of one dimer and the bidentate carboxyl group of Glu55 from another dimer (Fig. 3). The electron density in the region of the calcium-binding sites is well de®ned: the mean B value for the Ê calcium ions is 22.5 A2, with the B values of calcium-binding O Ê atoms varying between 20.4 and 25.3 A2. The average calcium Ê coordination distances are: Gln58 OE1, 2.05 (0.13) A; Ê and 2.43 (0.22) A, Ê Glu55 OE1 and OE2, 2.45 (0.20) A Ê respectively; Gln64 OE1, 2.24 (0.13) A, with the r.m.s. deviaActa Cryst.

tions given in parentheses estimated from the experimental spread of values; this is well within the limits for calcium± Ê oxygen distances at 2.7 A resolution (Harding, 2001). In addition, Glu66 from the ®rst dimer moves towards the new calcium-binding site relative to its position in the R3 structure. The side-chain O atoms of Glu66 are rather close to the Ê intermolecular calcium (mean distances are 4.5 and 5.3 A), so the calcium ion could be coordinated through an additional bridging water molecule which is not visible in the electrondensity maps at this resolution. The residues involved in intramolecular calcium binding vary throughout the S100 family, suggesting that this mode of hexamer formation is a unique feature of S100A12. Contacts through intermolecular metalbinding sites are common in hexamer formation, as seen in annexin XII where the hexamer has six intermolecular calciumbinding sites (Luecke et al., 1995) or insulin which forms a hexamer by binding two or more zinc ions (Whittingham et al., 1998).

The most signi®cant differences between the conformations of the residues in the P21 and R3 structures lie in the additional calcium-binding sites. Another unexpected difference is the conformation of the putative Zn2+/Cu2+-binding sites, which had been suggested on the basis of sequence comparisons with S100A7, for which a Zn-bound structure has been published (Brodersen et al., 1999). Comparison of the R3 structure of S100A12 with the structure of Zn-bound S100A7 (PDB codes 2psr, 3psr) shows that the putative Zn-binding sites in S100A12 are in a conformation close to that seen in Zn-loaded S100A7, even though they do not contain Zn ions. The situation is different for the hexamer structure presented here, where seven subunits are in the zinc-bound conformation and four (A, F, G, I) are in the `Zn-free' conformation with Glu25 turned away from the Zn-binding site (Fig. 4), while there is no electron density for Glu25 in subunit L. It is possible that the open `Zn-free' conformation is required for S100A12 to be able to incorporate Zn2+ (or Cu2+) ions at these unoccupied sites and that the resulting conformational changes might be important for its function. Our attempts to obtain a Zn2+-bound S100A12 structure have not so far been successful, as Zncontaining crystals only diffract to very low resolution. However, we have recently obtained copper containing crystals and our preliminary low-resolution results suggest that Cu2+ binds to the predicted Zn2+/Cu 2+binding motif (Moroz, Wilson and Bronstein, unpublished results).

3.3. Location of putative target-binding sites and possible biological implications

Sequence and structure comparison between members of the S100 family have suggested that the target-binding region in dimeric S100A12 is most probably formed by the linker region and the C-terminal residues of one subunit and the N-terminal residues of another subunit, creating two binding sites per dimer (Moroz et al., 2001). These putative binding

sites lie on the outer surface of the hexamer (Fig. 5a), giving the hexamer the capacity to make multimeric interactions with its receptor, namely the extracellular domains of RAGE. The extracellular calcium concentration is around 1 mM or more, which is 10 000-fold greater than inside the cell (Williams, 1996). Such a calcium concentration is suf®cient to lead to S100A12 hexamer formation according to DLS analysis. This suggests that the hexameric assembly may be one of the extracellular forms of S100A12, which binds to RAGE. It has been shown that binding of S100A12 to RAGE is a key step in one of the proin¯ammatory pathways (Hofmann et al., 1999). We have cloned, expressed and puri®ed a fragment of the RAGE extracellular domain and have demonstrated by Far-Western blot analysis that this fragment binds to S100A12 (Fig. 6). Because there are several lines of evidence that receptor oligomerization is one of the steps in the process of signal transduction, we suggest that by analogy with the activation of TNF superfamily receptors by TNF family cytokines, the S100A12 hexameric assembly interacts with three RAGE extracellular domains to form a complex with trimeric symmetry (Fig. 5b). As a result, the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor come into close proximity, inducing intracellular signalling. Thus, the ®rst step of such signal propagation in the extracellular space could be induced by calcium, generating hexamers from the S100A12 dimers, with their six potential Zn/Cu-binding sites possibly involved in receptor activation. Further experiments and crystal structures of S100±RAGE complexes are certainly required to gain support for our hypothesis. Understanding the atomic interactions of RAGE± S100 complexes will provide the insights essential for understanding the molecular and genetic factors that govern these initial signalling events and provide a structural basis for the design of ligands and the development of potential drugs.
