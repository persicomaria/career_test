The three-dimensional NMR structures of six analogues of somatostatin (SRIF) are described. These analogues with the amino acid 4-(N-isopropyl)-aminomethylphenylalanine (IAmp) at position 9 exhibit potent and highly selective binding to human SRIF subtype 1 receptors (sst1). The conformations reveal that the backbones of these analogues have a hairpin-like structure similar to the sst2-subtype-selective analogues. This structure serves as a scaffold for retaining a unique arrangement of the side chains of D-Trp8, IAmp9, Phe7, and Phe11 or m-I-Tyr11 (m-ITyr ) mono-iodo-tyrosine). The conformational preferences and results from biological analyses of these analogues1,2 allow a detailed study of the structure-activity relationship of SRIF. The proposed consensus pharmacophore of the sst1-selective analogues requires a unique set of distances between an indole/2-naphthyl ring, an IAmp side chain, and two aromatic rings. This motif is necessary and sufficient to explain the binding affinities of all of the analogues studied and is distinct from the existing models suggested for sst4 as well as sst2/sst5 selectivity.
Introduction Somatostatin (somatotropin release inhibiting factor, SRIF, H-Ala1-Gly2-c[Cys3-Lys4-Asn5-Phe6-Phe7-Trp8Lys9-Thr10-Phe11-Thr12-Ser13-Cys14]-OH), a cyclic tetradecapeptide, inhibits the release of several hormones including growth hormone (GH), glucagon, insulin, secretin, and gastrin.3,4 It also plays a vital role in neurotransmission and neuromodulation5,6 and has antiproliferative effects, regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. SRIF elicits its effects via high-affinity interactions with a family of five different receptors, sst1-5. Sequence homology is 39-57% among the five subtypes, and each subtype is highly conserved across different species. The functional significance of the endogenous receptors in mediating the diverse effects of SRIF requires the availability of subtype-selective agonists and antagonists, and hence SRIF continues to be a target for the development of subtype-specific analogues.7-11 Since the discovery of SRIF, numerous peptide and nonpeptide analogues have been described. With the characterization of the five sst, analogues can be tested for their biological activity in terms of affinity and selectivity.7-9,12-14 Early structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies using in vitro functional assays suggested a central involvement of the side chains of residues Trp8Lys9 for biological recognition.15-17 Furthermore, extensive structural studies including NMR and X-ray dif* Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

fraction18 have been carried out to elucidate the pharmacophore and the consensus structural motif of analogues binding predominantly to sst2/sst5 and sst4 receptors. According to the proposed model for sst2/sst5 binding,19-22 the side chains and the relative spatial arrangement of Phe7, D-Trp8, and Lys9 constitute the most essential elements (Figure 4D). The side chain of D-Trp8 is in close proximity to the side chain of Lys9 (4 Å), whereas the side chain of Phe7 is about 7-9 Å away from the side chain of D-Trp8 and 9-11 Å from the side chain of Lys9. Recently, our group studied the structures of sst4-selective SRIF analogues from three different families by NMR in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and proposed a pharmacophore model for these analogues.23 Although these analogues have different backbone conformations, the relative spatial arrangement of the side chains of D-Trp8, Lys9, and Phe6 or Phe11 were unique, and on this basis it was proposed that these residues and their observed proximity were important for binding. This binding motif mainly differs from the binding motif for sst2/sst5-selective receptors in the proximity of the side chains of Lys and Phe, which is 4.5-6.5 Å in the sst4 and 9-11 Å in the sst2/sst5 binding motifs (Figure 4C and D). These studies furthermore strongly support the idea of Nicolaou et al., who suggested that the backbone is not required for receptor binding but serves as a scaffold for supporting the important side chains.24 In this paper, the studies of Grace et al.23 on the characterization of the sst4 pharmacophore and of Falb et al.20 on the sst2 pharmacophore have been further extended to propose a pharmacophore model for sst1selective analogues. In the preceding two papers, the synthesis and biological characterization of two families of structurally constrained sst1-selective SRIF analogues

In this section, the chemical shift assignment and the structure determination by NMR of each SRIF analogue 1-6 given in Table 1 are presented. These six sst1selective analogues were selected to cover the chemical diversity uncovered in the two preceding papers1,2 and judged necessary and sufficient to elucidate the corresponding pharmacophore. Chemical Shift Assignment, Collection of Structural Restraints, and Structure Determination. The nearly complete chemical shift assignment of proton resonances (Supporting Information) for 1-6 (Table 1) has been carried out using two-dimensional (2D) NMR experiments using the standard procedure described in the Experimental Section. The N-terminal amino protons for 1 to 4 were not observed due to fast exchange with the solvent. Furthermore, some aromatic ring protons could not be assigned as shown in the Supporting Information. Due to the presence of the carbamoyl group at the N-terminus for analogues 5 and 6, the (Cbm) amide proton of Cys3 is observed at high field. For all six analogues, the nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) spectrum was measured with a mixing time of 100 ms, leading to approximately 150 meaningful distance restraints per analogue (Table 2). The NOEs observed were indicative of hairpinlike structures in all of the six analogues. The 3JHNR coupling constants could not be derived from the one-dimensional (1D) spectra due to line broadening and peak overlap observed in the amide region of the spectrum. These NOE distance restraints were used as input for the structure calculation with the program CYANA25 followed by restrained energy minimization using the program DISCOVER26 (for more details see the Experimental Section). The resulting bundle of 20 conformers per analogue represents the three-dimensional (3D) solution structure of each analogue. For each analogue, the small residual constraint violations in the 20 refined conformers (Table 2) and the good coincidence of experimental NOEs and short interatomic distances (data not shown) indicate that the input data represent a selfconsistent set and that the restraints are well-satisfied in the calculated conformers (Table 2). The deviations from ideal geometry are minimal, and similar energy values were obtained for all 20 conformers of each analogue (Figure 2). The root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) obtained for the sst1-selective analogues is

are described.1,2 Six analogues from these families, which bind selectively to the sst1 receptor, have been studied by NMR (Table 1). These analogues differ as follows: 1 has a lactam bridge from Glu6 to Lys12, 2 has a lactam bridge from Glu7 to Dbu( Ala)12, 3 and 4 are the same as 2 but contain Lys or L-hhLys in the bridging position 12 (Dbu( Ala) ) diaminobutyric acid, Ala ) H2N-CH2-CH2-COOH, L-hhLys ) L-2,8-diaminooctanoic acid ) L-homo-homo-lysine). Analogues 5 and 6 lack residue Tyr2 and the lactam bridge, and they differ from each other at position 7 by Phe and Ala, respectively. All of the analogues are cyclic with the disulfide bridge between Cys3 and Cys14. Although all of these analogues bind selectively to the sst1 receptor, their binding affinities vary from 200 nM for 1 to 2.5 nM for 5.

NMR Structure of SRIF Analogues
a The bundle of 20 conformers with the lowest residual target function was used to represent the NMR structures of each analogue. b Meaningful NOE distance restraints include intraresidual and sequential NOEs.25 c The target function is zero only if all the experimental distance and torsion angle constraints are fulfilled and all nonbonded atom pairs satisfy a check for the absence of steric overlap. The target function is proportional to the sum of the square of the difference between calculated distance and isolated constraint or van der Waals restraints and similarly isolated angular restraints are included in the target function. For the exact definition see ref 25.

higher than that for the sst4-selective analogues, recently published by our group. This can be explained by the smaller number of experimental NOEs per residue observed than those for the sst4-selective analogues, where an exceptionally large number of NOEs was observed and documented.23 To describe the 3D structures of 1 to 6 in a simple manner, we introduce the term "front side", which is defined as the surface of the peptide facing the reader when the peptide is oriented with the C-terminus on the left. The opposite surface of the peptide is correspondingly named the "backside". Three-Dimensional Structure of Dicyclo(3-14, 6-12)H-Tyr2-Cys3-Lys4-Glu6-Phe7-D-Trp8-IAmp9Thr10-Phe11-Lys12-Ser13-Cys14-OH (1). Analogue 1 binds to the sst1 receptor with low affinity (IC50 ) 200 nM) and does not bind to the other receptors. The quality of the structure is reflected by the small backbone rmsd (Table 2), which can also be visually discerned from Figure 2 showing the bundle of 20 conformers representing the 3D structure. On the basis of the backbone torsion angles (Table 3), the 3D structure contains a -turn of type-IV around D-Trp8-IAmp9, which is supported by the sequential and medium-range backbone NOE {dRN(i,i + 2)} between D-Trp8 and Thr10 (Figure 1). Strong sequential dRN(i,i + 1) and the weak dNN(i,i + 1) NOEs further confirm -sheet structure of the analogue. The structure is further stabilized as evidenced by the presence of a few long-range NOEs, dRR(3,14), dR (4, 3), dNR(4,14), dRR(6,12), and dRN(6,13). The low-temperature coefficient of -1.4 ppb/K experimentally observed for the amide proton of Thr10 is indicative of the observed hydrogen bond Thr10NHOGlu6. From the torsion angles listed in Table 3, it can be easily seen that the side chains of Phe7 and Phe11 are in the gauche- rotamer and that of D-Trp8 and IAmp9 are in the gauche+ rotamer. Concomitantly, the side chains of D-Trp8 and IAmp9 are oriented adjacent to each other, at the end of the hairpin pointing to the "front side", whereas the aromatic rings of Phe7 and Phe11 are oriented adjacent to each other, at the "backside" of the peptide. The lactam bridge is on the "front side" (Figures 2 and 3). Three-Dimensional Structure of Dicyclo(3-14, 7-12)H-Tyr2-Cys3-Lys4-Phe6-Glu7-D-Trp8-IAmp9Thr10-Phe11-Dbu( Ala)12-Ser13-Cys14-OH (2). Analogue 2 has a slightly higher binding affinity to sst1 than 1. It differs from 1 only in the position of the lactam bridge between Glu7 and Dbu( Ala)12, which has a longer side chain than the Lys12 of 1. The different position of the bridge orients the aromatic side chains differently and gives the backbone more flexibility (Figures 2 and 3). The strong sequential dRN(i,i + 1) and the weak dNN(i,i + 1) NOEs as well as the long range dRR(3,14), dNR(4,14), dNN(7,10), and dNN(8,11) NOEs further confirm a -sheet structure. The backbone torsion angles (Table 3) indicate that the 3D structure contains a -turn of type-II around D-Trp8-IAmp9, which was stabilized by the presence of the hydrogen bond between the amide proton of Thr10 and the carbonyl of Glu7. The low-temperature coefficient of -0.3 ppb/K experimentally observed for the amide proton of Thr10 is indicative of the expected hydrogen bond Thr10NHOGlu7. It can be seen from the torsion angles that the

Figure 1. Survey of characteristic NOEs used in CYANA for structure calculation for analogues 1-6. Thin, medium, and thick bars represent weak (4.5-6 Å), medium (3-4.5 Å), and strong (<3 Å) NOEs observed in the NOESY spectrum. The medium-range connectivities dNN(i,i + 2) and dRN(i,i + 2) NOEs are shown by lines starting and ending at the positions of the residues related by the NOE. Residues designated with "w", "Z", "X", "hhK", and "IY" correspond to the amino acids D-Trp, IAmp, Dbu( Ala), L-hhLys, and m-I-Tyr, respectively.

side chains of Glu7, IAmp9, and Thr10 are in the gauche+ rotamer and that of D-Trp8 and Phe11 are in the trans rotamer (Table 3). These rotamer positions result in a conformation in which the side chains of D-Trp8 and IAmp9 are adjacent to each other in the plane of the analogue backbone, whereas the side chains of Phe6 and Phe11 are adjacent on the front side of the peptide backbone. The lactam bridge is on the backside of the peptide backbone, far away from D-Trp8 and IAmp9 (Figures 2 and 3). Three-Dimensional Structure of Dicyclo(3-14, 7-12)H-Tyr2-Cys3-Lys4-Phe6-Glu7-D-Trp8-IAmp9Thr10-Phe11-Lys12-Ser13-Cys14-OH (3). Analogue 3 differs from 2 at position 12 by Lys and has a similar

binding affinity as 2. The strong sequential dRN(i,i + 1) and the few dNN(i,i + 1) NOEs, as well as the long range dRR(6,11), dNN(6,11), and dNN(7,10) NOEs, further confirm the -turn structure. The calculated NMR structure has a type-II-like -turn around D-Trp8 and IAmp9 (Figure 2 and Table 3) that has been stabilized by the observed hydrogen bond between the amide proton of Glu7 and carbonyl of Thr10. The temperature coefficient for Glu7 (NH) could not be measured experimentally due to line broadening and overlap. From the observed torsion angles, it can be seen that the side chain of D-Trp8 is in the gauche- rotamer, that of IAmp9 is in the trans rotamer orientation, and the aromatic side chains at Phe6 and Phe11 are adjacent in space and oriented on the front side of the peptide with the lactam bridge on the backside. The side chains of D-Trp8 and IAmp9 are pointing away from each other at the tip of the hairpinlike structure. The resulting close proximity between IAmp9 and the side chain of Thr10 is supported by the upfield shift of the protons (Supporting Information). These upfield shifts are not observed in 2 due to different spatial arrangement of IAmp9. The lactam bridge is close to the critical IAmp9 side chain in 3 (Figure 3).

Analogue 4 differs from 2 and 3 at position 12 with L-hhLys instead of Dbu( Ala) and Lys, respectively. The longer side chain in 4 led to higher binding affinity compared to that of 2 and 3.2 The strong sequential dRN(i,i + 1) NOEs and the dRN(i,i + 2) NOE between D-Trp8 and Thr10 confirm the type-III -turn around D-Trp8 and IAmp9 (Figure 2 and Table 3). The structure is further stabilized as evidenced by the presence of some long range dRN(3,14), dRN(6,13), dRR(6,11), and dRN(7,11) NOEs. Temperature coefficients could not be measured experimentally for the amide protons due to line broad-

ening and overlap problems. From the observed torsion angles, it can be seen that the side chains of D-Trp8 and IAmp9 are in the gauche- rotamer, and the aromatic side chains of Phe6 and Phe11 are in the gauche+ rotamer orientation. This results in a conformation in which the aromatic side chains of Phe6 and Phe11 are oriented adjacent to each other on the front side with the lactam bridge on the backside of the peptide (Figures 2 and 3).

Analogue 5 binds with high affinity and selectively to the sst1 receptor. The chemical structure differs from that of 1 to 4 by the carbamoylated N-terminus, m-I-Tyr at position 11, Thr at position 12, the absence of the lactam bridge, and the residue Tyr2. These chemical modifications change the backbone from

a -turn to a -turn around IAmp9, resulting in a different 3D structure. The -turn is supported by the weak dRN(i,i + 2) and dNN(i,i + 2) NOEs between D-Trp8 and Thr10 and by the observed hydrogen bond D-Trp8HN-OThr10. The low-temperature coefficient of -1.3 ppb/K measured experimentally for the amide hydrogen of D-Trp8 is further indicative of the hydrogen bond formation. On the basis of the torsion angles given in Table 3, it can be seen that the side chain of D-Trp8 is in the gauche- rotamer, that of Phe6, IAmp9, and Thr10 are in the trans rotamer, and that of m-I-Tyr11 is in the gauche+ rotamer. Concomitantly, the side chains of D-Trp8 and IAmp9 are pointing away from each other, with the side chain of Phe7 close to the side chain of D-Trp8 in the front side (Figure 2). The close proximity is supported by the ring current, resulting in the upfield shift of the aromatic protons of Phe7. Three-Dimensional Structure of Cyclo(3-14)Cbm-Cys3-Lys4-Phe6-Ala7-D-Trp8-IAmp9-Thr10-m-ITyr11-Thr12-Ser13-Cys14-OH (6). Analogue 6 binds with moderate affinity and differs from 5 by the replacement of Phe7 by Ala7. Originally, 6 was synthesized and analyzed in order to define the role of Phe6 in the binding affinity of 5. The backbone in the calculated structure (Figure 2) is very different from that of 5 with a kink at IAmp9 and a type-III-like -turn around Thr10 and m-I-Tyr11, which is supported by the few strong dRN(i,i + 1) and weak dNN(i,i + 1) observed (Figure 1). Furthermore, there were no long-range NOEs nor hydrogen bonds observed in all of the 20 calculated structures. On the basis of the side chain torsion angles, it can be seen that the side chains of Phe6 and Thr10 are in the gauche+ rotamer, Ala7 is in the trans rotamer, and IAmp9 is in the gauche- rotamer (Table 3). This orients the side chains of Phe6 and m-I-Tyr11 to the backside of the peptide backbone as in the case of 1. Discussion Our group has synthesized a large number of cyclic and dicyclic analogues of SRIF, some of which bind selectively with high affinity to the sst1 receptor.1,7 We have shown here that the understanding of the structural requirements of cyclic SRIF analogues binding to sst1 receptor selectively, derived from extensive structural studies of two peptide families, can lead to the identification of the binding motif based on the 3D consensus structure. This, in turn, can be utilized in a predictive manner in designing selective SRIF analogues. The characterization of the bioactive conformation and the elucidation of the consensus 3D structural motif for the sst1-selective SRIF analogues 1-6 (Table 1) are carried out using high-resolution NMR techniques. Assuming that the compounds studied in DMSO are in their bioactive conformation,20,27 the proposed consensus structure is equivalent to the binding motif of sst1-selective analogues and hence represents a pharmacophore for the sst1 receptor. The Consensus Structural Motif for the Sst1Selective SRIF Analogues. All of the sst1-selective analogues with high-binding affinity studied here have either a -turn (1 to 4) around D-Trp8-IAmp9 or a -turn at IAmp9 (5). More importantly, they have similar spatial orientations/locations for some of the side chains, suggesting a role for these side chains in enhancing the

The following color code is used: red (1) dicyclo(3-14, 6-12)H-Tyr-Cys3-Lys-Glu6Phe-D-Trp-IAmp-Thr-Phe-Lys12-Ser-Cys14-OH; violet (2) dicyclo(3-14, 7-12)H-Tyr-Cys3-Lys-Phe-Glu7-D-Trp-IAmp-ThrPhe-Dbu( Ala)12-Ser-Cys14-OH; cyan (3) dicyclo(3-14, 7-12)HTyr-Cys3-Lys-Phe-Glu7-D-Trp-IAmp-Thr-Phe-Lys12-Ser-Cys14OH; brown (4) dicyclo(3-14, 7-12)H-Tyr-Cys3-Lys-Phe-Glu7D-Trp-IAmp-Thr-Phe-L-hhLys12-Ser-Cys14-OH. The residues involved in binding are colored as IAmp (blue), D-Trp (light green), and Phe (yellow). Analogue 1 has the aromatic side chains Phe7 and Phe11 oriented on the "backside" of the peptide, different from that of analogues 2 to 4, where they are oriented on the "front side", with the lactam bridge on the "backside", which explains the lower binding affinity of 1.

binding affinity to sst1 receptors as well as disrupting binding to other sst. Figure 2 shows the sst1-selective analogues oriented individually, with specific color coding, highlighting the four side chains of interest, namely, the indole at position 8, D-Trp8 (green), the aromatic-alkyl at position 9, IAmp9 (blue), and the two aromatic rings at position 6 or 7 and 11 (yellow). Figure 4A shows the superposition of these four amino acids of 2 to 5 (as we shall see in the following, 1 and 6 have not been used in the definition of the consensus structure). Although the four structures superimposed contain different backbone conformations and are either monocyclic (5) or dicyclic (2-4), they all show a unique arrangement of the four side chains of residues: IAmp and D-Trp at the tip of the hairpin and the aromatic rings at position 6 or 7 and 11 on the front side of the peptide. This consensus structural motif, together with the binding affinities of the analogues (Table 1), clearly suggests that the arrangement of these four side chains Phe6/Phe7, D-Trp8, IAmp9, and m-I-Tyr11/Phe11 are important for high-affinity and selective binding to sst1 (5). The 3D structures determined for the four sst1selective SRIF analogues together with the data on bioactivity listed in Table 1 and preceding papers1,2,13 enabled a detailed SAR study. In this consensus structural motif, the distances between the C of residue Trp8 and C of Phe6/7 is 6-7.5 Å, C of residue Trp8 and C

of IAmp9 is 7-8 Å, C of residue Trp8 and C of Phe/ m-I-Tyr11 is 9.5-12 Å, C of residue IAmp9 and C of Phe6/7 is 9-11 Å, C of residue IAmp9 and C of Phe/ m-I-Tyr11 is 8-10 Å, and C of Phe6/7 and Phe/m-I-Tyr11 is 6-7.5 Å. Higher binding affinity is obtained when the aromatic ring of Phe/m-I-Tyr11 is in close proximity to the indole and the IAmp9 side chains than otherwise. Conservative replacements of these residues do not change the binding affinities and receptor selectivity evidently.1,2,13 However, IAmp replacement by Lys at position 9 enables the analogue to bind to all of the receptors, and hence a longer side chain at position 9 is important for selective binding to sst1. Similarly, m-ITyr at position 11 almost exclusively increases the binding affinity by a factor of 2. Also the N-terminal carbamoylation increases the binding affinity by a factor of 2. The low-binding affinity of 1 can be explained by the misplacement of the aromatic rings at position 6 and 11, which are located on the backside of the peptide. Also in 6, Phe6 and m-I-Tyr11 are located on the backside of the peptide. The higher binding affinity of this analogue compared to 1 is explained by the addition of m-I-Tyr and carbamoylation. Indeed, 6 without carbamoylation has a binding affinity lowered by a factor of 2 (data not shown). Comparison of the Sst1-Selective vs Sst2/Sst5and Sst4-Selective Pharmacophores.

(A) Stereoview of the superposition of the 3D structure of the sst1-selective analogue 5 (green) with the 3D structure of the sst2/sst5-selective octreotide (magenta).29 It must be noted that m-I-Tyr11 is missing in octreotide which is important for selective binding to sst1 receptors. Also, D-Trp-IAmp differs in their spatial orientation relative to the D-Trp-Lys pair. Phe7 is also oriented on the backside of the peptide in sst2/sst5-selective pharmacophore. (B) Stereoview of the superposition of the 3D structure of the sst1-selective analogue 5 (green) with the 3D structure of the sst4-selective cyclo(3-14)H-Cys3-Phe6-Ala7-Trp8-Lys9-Phe11Thr12-Cys14-OH (orange).23 The sst4 pharmacophore is completely different from sst1 pharmacophore in the spatial orientation of Lys9 and Phe11. (C) Stereoview of the superposition of the 3D structure of the sst1-selective 5 (green) with the 3D structure of the nonselective cyclo(3-14)H-Cys3-Phe6-Phe7-Trp8-Lys9-Phe11-Thr12-Cys14-OH, 7 (gray),23 which binds with high affinity to all five receptors. This analogue has all the four side chains important for binding to sst1 almost in the expected proximity and also the side chains important for sst4.

SRIF analogues (Figure 4, parts A and B), a comparison of this motif with the proposed pharmacophore of sst2/ sst5- and sst4-selective analogues (Figures 4C and 4D) is carried out here. Goodman and co-workers illustrated that in SRIF analogues, which bind selectively to sst2/ sst5, the side chains of D-Trp8, Lys9, and Phe7 constitute the most essential elements necessary for binding.28,29 In their pharmacophore model, the side chains of D-Trp8 and Lys9 were in close proximity of 4 Å (C positions), but the side chain of Phe7 was farther away from that of D-Trp8 (7 to 9 Å), which varies from the sst1 pharmacophore, wherein the phenylalanine (Phe6/7) is in close proximity to D-Trp8 (6-7.5 Å), while D-Trp8 and IAmp9 are at a proximity of 7-8 Å. This difference can

easily be seen by superimposing the sst1-selective 5 and the sst2/sst5-selective octreotide (Figure 5A).29 In octreotide, Phe7 is on the backside of the peptide, whereas in sst1-selective 5, the two aromatic side chains at position 7 and 11 are on the front side of the peptide. Furthermore, they differ in the position with respect to the indole ring at position 8 and from the side chain at position 9. Recently our group has proposed a pharmacophore model of sst4-selective analogues.23 In this model, the side chains of D-Trp8, Lys9, and Phe6 or Phe11 form the binding motif, with the aromatic ring in close proximity of 4.5 to 6.5 Å to Lys9 and at a distance of 5.5-9.5 Å to the indole ring. This pharmacophore differs from that

of the sst2/sst5-selective analogues in the position of the phenylalanine ring23 (Figure 4C). Comparing the sst4 pharmacophore with that of sst1 pharmacophore (Figure 5B) reveals that in the sst4-selective analogue the aromatic ring of Phe6 or Phe11 is close to the side chain of Lys9 at the backside of the peptide and hence it is completely in a different position when compared with the m-I-Tyr/Phe11 of sst1 selective pharmacophore, which are on the front side of the peptide (Figure 5B). Furthermore, the indole ring and the side chain of Lys are in close proximity in sst4-selective analogues, whereas in the sst1-selective pharmacophore they are farther apart. In summary, the sst1 pharmacophore differs from sst2 and sst4 selective analogues by the side chain at position 9 and in the positions of the two aromatic rings at positions 6 or 7 and 11; they are on the front side of the peptide when interacting with sst1 and are located on the backside when interacting with the sst2/sst5- and sst4-selective analogues (Figures 4 and 5). In our recent paper proposing the pharmacophore for the sst4 receptor, we also solved the 3D structure of a highly active, but nonselective analogue 7 (Figure 5C, analogue 1).23 It is therefore interesting to determine whether this nonselective analogue contains the sst1 pharmacophore as well. Clearly, structural interpretations of analogues with binding affinity to several receptors should be made with caution, because the binding to different receptors might involve an induced fit mechanism and therefore the structures determined might change upon binding. However, the intrinsic orientation of the side chains might already be prearranged. Indeed, we reported that the structure of 723 contains the pharmacophore of sst4 (Phe11 as part of the pharmacophore of sst4). Interestingly, the side chains of Phe6 and Phe7 at the front side fit the proposed pharmacophore of sst1-selective analogues, which is conserved in the 3D structure (Figure 5C). The relatively low binding affinity for sst2 is reflected by a poor alignment of the sst2/sst5 pharmacophore in the 3D structure as well as the presence of Trp8 instead of D-Trp. Overall, this observation further supports the proposed sst1 pharmacophore. Conclusions The 3D conformations of six cyclic SRIF analogues having selective binding affinity to the sst1 receptor have been studied in DMSO. In the analogues with high binding affinity (2-5), the relative spatial orientations of the side chains of D-Trp8, IAmp9, Phe6/7, and Phe11/ m-I-Tyr11 are similar. These studies indicate that the backbone conformation forms a scaffold to orient the side chains of the essentially important residues, namely, tryptophan at position 8, aminoalkyl function at position 9, and two aromatic rings, in their respective positions for effective receptor-ligand binding. On the basis of the consensus structure, a pharmacophore has been proposed for sst1-selective analogues consisting of these four side chains. This pharmacophore differs from that of sst2/sst5-selective analogues in the proximity between the side chains of IAmp and D-Trp as well as the aromatic side chains (Figure 4). It also differs from the pharmacophore of sst4-selective analogues by one additional aromatic ring and also in the proximity between all of these side chains (Figure 5). The conformational

study of the octapeptide analogues as well as of SRIF14 that bind to all of the receptors also confirms the proposed model (data not shown). Furthermore, the model proposed also explains the selective binding of the nonpeptide analogues of SRIF agonists.30-33 The structural elucidation of the sst1-selective binding motif and the known motif for sst4 and sst2/sst5-selective analogues support the detailed understanding of SRIF and its receptors and will have an important role in designing highly selective peptides as well as nonpeptide ligands of SRIF. Experimental Section
Sample Preparation and NMR Experiments. Analogues were synthesized by the solid-phase approach either manually or on a CS-Bio peptide synthesizer model CS536.1,2,7-9,13 NMR samples were prepared by dissolving 2.5 mg of the analogue in 0.5 mL of DMSO-d6. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 700 MHz spectrometer operating at proton frequency of 700 MHz. Chemical shifts were measured using DMSO ( ) 2.49 ppm) as an internal standard. Also, the 1D spectra were acquired at temperatures between 300 and 323 K and were used to measure the temperature coefficients of the amide resonances. The 2D spectra were acquired at 298 K. Assignments of the various proton resonances have been carried out using total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY),34,35 double-quantum filtered spectroscopy (DQF-COSY),36 and NOESY.37-39 The TOCSY experiments employed the MLEV17 spin-locking sequence suggested by Davis and Bax,34 applied for a mixing time of 50 or 70 ms. The NOESY experiments were carried out with a mixing time of 100 ms. The TOCSY and NOESY spectra were acquired using 600 complex data points in the 1 dimension and 1024 complex data points in the 2 dimension with t1max ) 47 ms and a t2max ) 120 ms and were subsequently zero-filled to 1024 × 2048 before Fourier transformation. The DQF-COSY spectra were acquired with 1024 × 4096 data points and were zero-filled to 2048 × 4096 before Fourier transformation. The TOCSY, DQFCOSY, and NOESY spectra were acquired with 16, 16, and 64 scans, respectively, with a relaxation delay of 1 s. The signal from the residual water of the solvent was suppressed using presaturation during the relaxation delay as well as the mixing time. The TOCSY and NOESY data were multiplied by a 75° shifted sine function in both dimensions before Fourier transformation. All of the spectra were processed using the software PROSA (processing algorithms).40 The spectra were analyzed using the software X-EASY in CARA.41 Structure Determination. The chemical shift assignment of the major conformer (the population of the minor conformer was <10%) was obtained by the standard procedure using DQF-COSY and TOCSY spectra for intraresidual assignment, and the NOESY spectrum was used for the sequential assignment.42 The collection of structural restraints is based on the NOEs. Dihedral angle constraints were obtained from the intraresidual and sequential NOEs along with the macro GRIDSEARCH in the program CYANA (combined assignment and dynamics algorithm for NMR applications).25 The calibration of NOE intensities versus 1H-1H distance restraints and appropriate pseudoatom corrections to the nonstereospecifically assigned methylene, methyl, and ring protons were performed using the program CYANA. On an average, approximately 150 NOE constraints and 20 angle constraints were utilized while calculating the conformers (Table 2). In analogues with the additional lactam bridge, the distance between the C of the Glu7 and the NZ of Lys9, Dbu9, or L-hhLys9 residues involved in the bridge was given as an additional distance restraint. A total of 100 conformers were initially generated by CYANA, and a bundle containing 20 CYANA conformers with the lowest target function values was utilized for further restrained energy minimization, using the CFF91 force field43 with the energy criteria fit 0.1 kcal/(mol/ Å)44 in the program DISCOVER with steepest decent algo-
