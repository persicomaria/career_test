Abstract We have developed several kinds of protein kinase inhibitors, which are classified as isoquinolinesulfonamides and characterized as ATP competitive inhibitors of Ser/Thr protein kinases. These include H9, H89, KN62, and 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-homopiperazine (HA-1077) against protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A, Ca2 + /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and Rho-kinase, respectively, and they have been used widely to confirm the involvement of the target protein kinase in biological or physiological reaction(s). In some cases, inhibitors have predicted the involvement of the target protein kinase in cell or tissue before its precise mechanism or its effector was defined. On a clinical level, we developed the Rho-kinase inhibitor HA-1077 as an anti-spastic that effectively suppresses the spasm of cerebral arteries after subarachnoid hemorrhage. We have improved HA-1077 to obtain (S)-(+)-2-methyl-1-[(4-methyl-5-isoquinoline)sulfonyl]-homopiperazine (H-1152P), which is a more selective inhibitor of Rho-kinase, with a Ki value of 1.6 nM for Rho-kinase, 630 nM for protein kinase A, and 9270 nM for PKC. This inhibitor suppressed the phosphorylation of myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substance (MARCKS) in neuronal cells stimulated with lysophosphatidic acid, whose phosphorylation site was confirmed to be the Ser159 residue, using a phosphorylation site-specific antibody. In contrast, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced phosphorylation of MARCKS was scarcely inhibited by H-1152P. Furthermore, lysophosphatidic acid-stimulated phosphorylation in neuronal cells was characterized as a C3 toxinsensitive event. Our results show that the Rho-kinase inhibitor targets a protein with a well-known function, MARCKS in neuronal cells. Although MARCKS is widely recognized as a substrate of PKC, our results raise the possibility that MARCKS is a target protein of Rhokinase in neuronal cells. In this review, we address the possible role of Rho-kinase in neuronal functions, using the Rho-kinase specific inhibitor H-1152P. D 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction It is accepted that protein kinases play a pivotal role in the transduction of signals in cellular systems. Protein kinase inhibitors have been widely used to confirm or predict the involvement of a specific protein kinase in signal transduction (Hidaka & Kobayashi, 1992; Ono-Saito et al., 1999). Since 1984, we have developed a number of synthetic protein kinase inhibitors; mainly, Ser/Thr protein kinase inhibitors (Hidaka et al., 1984; Chijiwa et al., 1989; Inagaki et al., 1986). Among these compounds, we have further improved isoquinolinesulfonamide derivatives to obtain much more potent, specific, and membrane-penetrable compounds; from H7 or 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-homopiperazine (HA-1077) to (S)-(+)-2-methyl-1-[(4-methyl-5isoquinoline)sulfonyl]-homopiperazine (H-1152P) (Fig. 1). In the laboratory, the compound must be penetrable when used in intact cell systems and tissue or whole animal systems. In some cases, less selective inhibitors have led to a misunderstanding of the involvement of a target protein kinase. In contrast, in clinical use, a loosely selective, but potent, inhibitor is required. For example, abnormal contraction of arterial smooth muscle, particularly vasospasm, may be associated with the complex activation of multiple protein kinases, e.g., some protein kinases, such as protein kinase C (PKC), small G-protein Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), as well as the 20-kDa myosin light chain

(MLC20) kinase (MLCK), increase the phosphorylation of some contractile proteins (Fukata et al., 2001). Thus, an inhibitor with a comparatively broad spectrum may be effective in the clinic. In this report, we first describe the biochemical and pharmacological properties of the isoquinolinesulfonamide HA-1077 and its anti-spastic effect on the cerebral artery. Next, we describe the biochemical and pharmacological properties of the novel Rho-kinase inhibitor H-1152, which is highly potent and specific, with a Ki value of 1.6 nM.

2. 1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-homopiperazine with anti-spasm activity 2.1. Biochemical and pharmacological properties 2.1.1. Inhibition of protein kinase activity Like some isoquinolinesulfonamine derivatives, HA1077 showed an ATP-competitive inhibitory effect against several kinds of protein kinases; it was particularly specific against Rho-kinase (Nagumo et al., 2000). Its inhibitory activity is summarized in Table 1. Like H-7 family compounds, we first introduced HA-1077 as a PKC and MLCK inhibitor, and it has been used to confirm PKC involvement in cell functions, particularly in vasoconstriction mechanisms (Sasaki & Sasaki, 1990; Maiese et al., 1994). In 1987, we reported that HA-1077 promoted the disorganization of actin-containing microfilament bundles, which was attributed to inhibition of intracellular Ca2 + -sensitive and ATPdependent function such as PKC phosphorylation of an actin-binding protein(s) (Sasaki et al., 1987). The result predicted the involvement of a kinase in the organization of the actin filaments before the discovery of the kinase and its function. Recently, we (Nagumo et al., 2000) and Uehata et al. (1997) reported that this compound specifically inhibits Rho-kinase, with a Ki value of 0.35 mM.

2.1.2. Inhibition of smooth muscle contraction and 20-kDa myosin-light chain phosphorylation In parallel with the biochemical study, we have investigated the inhibitory effect of HA-1077 on smooth muscle contraction and MLC20 phosphorylation (Seto et al., 1991). We picked up HA-1077 from screening with vasodilation tests in vitro and in vivo. HA-1077, but not conventional Ca2 + -entry blockers, reduced the A23187-induced contraction of isolated rabbit aortic smooth muscle in a dose-dependent manner (Asano et al., 1987). This compound also suppressed the prostaglandin (PG)F2a-induced contraction of the rabbit aorta more effectively than that induced by high KCl depolarization (Seto et al., 1991). Its inhibitory activity was not significantly modified by various inhibitors, such as atropine, propranolol, theophylline, and indomethacin. We confirmed that HA-1077 inhibits receptor agonist-induced contraction in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2 + to a similar extent; ED50 values in both cases were  10 mM, whereas verapamil at concentrations up to 100 mM failed to relax the intracellular-dependent contraction (Asano et al., 1987). HA-1077 seems to preferentially inhibit the extracellular Ca2 + -independent mechanism. Taken together, these findings indicate that HA-1077 exerts its inhibitory effect on smooth muscle contraction downstream of the cytoplasmic membrane receptors, presumably at a common and final step of the contraction mechanism, such as MLC20 phosphorylation, F-actin filament organization, or F-actin/ myosin organization. As MLC20 phosphorylation is one of the most essential pathways for contraction-force development in arterial smooth muscle, we examined the effect of HA-1077 on MLC20 phosphorylation and contractile-force generation in rabbit aorta stimulated with PGF2a (Seto et al., 1991). At the points of maximum force development in the initial phase, 50-mM HA-1077 preferentially reduced MLC20 phosphorylation at both Thr18 and Ser19 (diphosphorylation) from 8.5% to almost 0, and MLC20 phosphorylation at Ser19 (monophosphorylation) from 36% to 8.5%. The IC50 of HA-1077 was 0.3 mM for the diphosphorylation and 2.1 mM for the monophosphorylation. At a concentration as high as 100 mM, nifedipine and verapamil hardly inhibited the PGF2a-induced contraction of arterial smooth muscle. These results suggest that HA-1077 preferentially inhibits the diphosphorylation of MLC20 over the monophosphorylation, and that both phosphorylation mechanisms are somewhat

different. We have hypothesized that MLC20 diphosphorylation during receptor agonist-induced contraction of smooth muscles is associated with both the MLCK-pathway and another novel pathway that is inhibited by HA-1077 (Seto et al., 1993; Seto & Sasaki, 1999). Recently, we demonstrated that HA-1077 inhibits Rho-kinase in vitro, with a Ki value of 0.3 mM, and GTPgS-stimulates the phosphorylation of the 130 kDa myosin-binding protein, and prevents the decrease in myosin phosphatase activity (Nagumo et al., 2000). It is generally accepted that certain receptor agonists promote the activation of the Rho-involved pathway: PGF2a (Seto & Sasaki, 1999) and thromboxane A2 (Suzuki et al., 1999). On the other hand, it has been reported that CPI17 is phosphorylated by PKC in smooth muscles upon stimulation with certain receptor agonists, thereby reducing the myosin phosphatase activity (Eto et al., 1997; Kitazawa et al., 2000). Although for a long time many researchers have reported the PKC inhibition of smooth muscle contraction by PKC inhibitors, the precise mechanism has been obscure, mainly because the target molecule was unknown (Nishizawa et al., 1992; Seto et al., 1993; Mitsui & Karaki, 1993). We obtained the preliminary result that HA-1077 inhibited CPI17 phosphorylation in the arteries stimulated by PGF2a (manuscript in preparation). These findings led us to speculate that HA1077 inhibited MLC20 phosphorylation by suppressing both Rho-kinase and PKC, in part by inhibition of MLCK. Judging from the Ki values for protein kinases, it is plausible that HA-1077 preferentially inhibits both Rho-kinase and PKC, and thereby reduces the MLC20 phosphorylation in smooth muscle. The inferred mechanism of HA-1077 inhibition of smooth muscle contraction is shown in Fig. 2.

2.2. Anti-spastic activity of 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)homopiperazine 2.2.1. Inhibition of vasospasm of intimal hyperplastic artery We have hypothesized that vasospasm often occurs in arteries at a site of intimal injury and thickening, and that it is associated with hyper and sustained MLC20 phosphorylation, particularly at Thr18 and Ser19 (Seto et al., 1993; Seto & Sasaki, 1999). Thus, to assess the anti-spastic activity of HA-1077, we prepared a model of arterial intimal thickening using rabbit carotids. Initial thickening occurred 6 months after balloon injury (Seto et al., 1995). HA-1077 inhibited the contraction of the hyperplastic artery stimulated by high K + and PGF2a, compared with the control. In this model, HA-1077 concomitantly suppressed MLC20 phosphorylation, especially the diphosphorylation. Additionally, when we used a slightly modified canine double hemorrhage model [subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)], a marked dilation of the spastic basilar artery was observed 7 days after the intravenous administration of HA-1077 (10 mg/kg) (Takayasu et al., 1986). 2.2.2. Inhibition of coronary spasm Shimokawa et al. (1996) described an interleukin (IL)1b-induced swine coronary spastic model that showed vasospastic responses, such as hypersensitivity to spasmogens and augmented and sustained contraction. In this model, we showed a significantly augmented phosphorylation of MLC20, in particular the diphosphorylation. Intracoronary administration of HA-1077 (10 ­100 mg/kg) inhibited serotonin-induced coronary spasm in a dose-dependent manner, as observed by angiography. In a segment of IL-1b-treated swine coronary artery placed in an organ bath, HA-1077 also inhibited the contraction induced by serotonin, concomitantly with reduction of the MLC20 phosphorylation in the serotonin-stimulated coronary segment (Katsumata et al., 1997). In particular, the MLC20 diphosphorylation was completely abolished by low concentrations of HA1077. These results suggest that HA-1077 preferentially inhibits MLC20 diphosphorylation rather than monophosphorylation, and, consequently, inhibits abnormal contraction in a coronary spasm. 2.3. Clinical trials with 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)homopiperazine: double-blind study on delayed cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage Since HA-1077 was characterized as an anti-spastic reagent, using in vitro and in situ spastic models, we challenged a delayed human cerebral vasospasm after SAH. In parallel with these experiments, we conducted several lines of acute and chronic toxicity of the compound and its pharmacokinetics, and, consequently, confirmed the absence of severe toxicity to challenge in a clinical trial. With the cooperation of 60 neurosurgical centers in Japan, a prospective randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind trial

of HA-1077 was undertaken to examine the effect of the drug on delayed cerebral vasospasm in patients with a ruptured cerebral aneurysm (Shibuya et al., 1992). Thus, 267 patients who underwent surgery within 3 days after SAH of Hunt and Hess Grade I­ IV were administrated either 30-mg HA-1077 or saline with hypertonic glycerin (placebo) by intravenous injection over 30 min, 3 times a day for 14 days following surgery. The evaluation points of the trial were: 1. Occurrence of angiographically determined vasospasm; 2. incidence of symptomatic vasospasm; 3. incidence and extent of low-density areas on computerized topography scans associated with vasospasm; and 4. clinical outcome 1 month later. 2.3.1. Angiographical determination of vasospasm Post-operative angiography was performed between days 5 and 21. The number of patients with moderate or severe angiographically demonstrated vasospasm was significantly decreased to 38% in the HA-1077 group (36 of 95 cases) and 61% in the placebo group (59 of 96 cases). After surgery, the incidence of angiographical vasospasm in the placebo group was similar to that of the general-treated patients in Japan. 2.3.2. Clinical outcome Treatment with HA-1077 significantly reduced the number of patients with a poor Glasgow Outcome Scale scored outcome. In the HA-1077-treated group, patients with a heavy Glasgow Outcome Scale outcome (moderate, severe disability, present vegetative state, and death) amounted to only 12% (12 of 99 cases) and in the placebo group, 26%. We consider that this beneficial effect of HA-1077 results from two factors: a vasodilating effect (anti-spastic effect) and a protective effect of HA-1077 on the ischemic brain from Ca2 + overload (Satoh et al., 1999).

3. (S)-(+)-2-methyl-1-[(4-methyl-5-isoquinoline)sulfonyl]homopiperazine: a novel and specific Rho-kinase inhibitor In non-neuronal cells, the involvement of Rho-kinase has been evaluated in various systems. In many cases, the mechanisms of Rho-kinase are attributed to the rearrangement of the actin-containing cytoskeleton structure and focal adhesions and down-regulation of myosin phosphatase activity (Nagumo et al., 2000; Fukata et al., 2001; Narumiya et al., 1997). Various proteins that are associated with signal transduction, cellular contraction, and movement have been reported as potential effectors for Rho or/and Rho-kinases (for a review, see Fukata et al., 2001). In neuronal cells or the CNS, Rho-kinase is known to be a potent regulator of neurogenetic events, such as axon

229

elongation and retraction cycle, axon guidance and synaptogenesis, or neuritogenesis in cultured neuronal cells (Kozma et al., 1997; Bito et al., 2000). Some of these events have been explained in part through receptor-mediated contraction and rearrangement of the actin-containing cytoskeleton (Kozma et al., 1997; Moolenaar et al., 1997), while little is known about the role of Rho and Rho-kinase in other fundamental functions of the CNS, such as signal transduction and release of neurotransmitter. This may be because no Rho-kinase target molecule has been identified. 3.1. Search of Rho-kinase targeting proteins During another clinical trial on delayed and semi-chronic cerebral infarction involving HA-1077, we observed an unexpected and good recovery of consciousness (unpublished data). This was not considered to be due to the vasodilation effect of HA-1077. We have investigated the direct effect of HA-1077 on neuronal cells, particularly on neurotransmitter release and/or neuronal cell protection. Among several kinds of candidates in such events, we selected the molecule involved in the release of neurotransmitters, i.e., the synapsins and myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substance (MARCKS). We recently demonstrated that MARCKS was phosphorylated by Rho-kinase in vitro and that its phosphorylation site was found to be the Ser159 residue (Fig. 3), which is recognized as a PKC site (Nagumo et al., 2001). As lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is known to activate a small

G-protein Rho-involved mechanism to thereby activate Rho-kinase, we used the LPA-stimulated human neuronal NT-2 cell system and investigated MARCKS phosphorylation (Fig. 4). We confirmed that LPA-stimulated phosphorylation is GTPgS-dependent and sensitive to C3 toxin, which specifically promotes ADP ribosylation to inactivate Rho. Thus, we assessed the effects of the conventional Rho-kinase inhibitors HA-1077 and (+)-(R)-trans-4-(1-aminoethyl)N-(4-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide dihydrochloride (Y-27632) on the LPA-evoked MARCKS phosphorylation using the NT-2 cell system. However, these inhibitors did not clearly inhibit only LPA-induced MARCKS phosphorylation, but also the phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu)-induced one, although to a weaker extent (Ikenoya et al., 2002), probably due to the poor specificity of the inhibitor. It remains unclear whether Rho-kinase exerts its effect downstream of the LPA/Rho signaling in neuronal cells or if a more specific Rho-kinase inhibitor is required. 3.2. Biochemical properties of (S)-(+)-2-methyl-1[(4-methyl-5-isoquinoline)sulfonyl]-homopiperazine H-1152P was newly synthesized, and its effect on recombinant Rho-kinase activity was investigated. As shown in Fig. 5, H-1152P competitively inhibited Rho-kinase activity with respect to ATP, with a Ki value of 1.6 nM. To assess the selectivity of H-1152P, we determined the Ki values of this compound for three other Ser/Thr protein kinases: protein kinase A (PKA), PKC, and MLCK. The Ki

Recombinant MARCKS was phosphorylated by non-enzyme (lane 1), PKC (lane 2), PKA (lane 3), Rho-kinase (RhoK) (lane 4), Cdc5/ p25 (lane 5), and MAPK (lane 6) in a standard reaction mixture containing 0.1 mM [g-32P]-ATP or cold ATP. The reaction was terminated by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer, and the resulting sample was subjected to 5 ­ 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, radioactivity was measured in a Fuji BAS 2000 Bio-image Analyzer (upper panel), and other non-isotopic samples were immunoblotted with antibody against Ser159-phosphorylated MARCKS (lower panel).

Fig. 5. Structure of H-1152P and its kinetic analysis. The protein kinase reaction was conducted with a reaction mixture containing recombinant Rho-kinase, 40 mM S6 peptide, 10 ­ 100 mM ATP, and 0 ­ 40 nM H-1152P [0 nM (6), 5 nM (.), 10 nM (&), 20 nM (4), and 40 nM (~)]. The apparent Km/Vmax is plotted as a function of the concentration of H-1152P.

values of these kinases were, respectively,  390, 5800, and 6300 times higher than that of the Rho-kinase (Table 1). Moreover, the inhibitory activity and the selectivity of H-1152P were much more potent, as compared with those of HA-1077 and Y-27632. Although we do not have any data on the conformation of H-1152P, we speculate that the substitution of two methyl groups on the HA-1077 molecule may result in a steric hindrance to fix the molecule in a certain conformation, probably for the ATP-binding site of Rho-kinase. 3.3. Inhibition by (S)-(+)-2-methyl-1-[(4-methyl-5-isoquinoline)sulfonyl]-homopiperazine of myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate phosphorylation in NT-2 cells H-1152P was applied to the neuronal cell system of LPA/ MARCKS phosphorylation to confirm the involvement of Rho-kinase. H-1152P, even at 0.1 mM, clearly suppressed only the phosphorylation of MARCKS in LPA-treated cells. H-1152P, in the range of 1 ­10 mM, significantly inhibited LPA-induced MARCKS phosphorylation (Ikenoya et al., 2002). In contrast, H-1152P simply tended to inhibit of PDBu-induced MARCKS phosphorylation. To further clarify the involvement of PKC in the LPA/ MARCKS phosphorylation system, we applied the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 to the system because the conventional Rho-kinase inhibitors, which have broad-spectrum activity, inhibited the PDBu-induced MARCKS phosphorylation in the cell system. Ro-31-8220 inhibited the PDBuinduced MARCKS phosphorylation at the Ser159 residue in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 0.3 mM. LPA-induced phosphorylation was also inhibited, but inhibition was significant only when 10-mM Ro-31-8220 was used. At present, we cannot exclude the involvement of PKC in the induction of Rho-kinase activation in the signal transduction pathway downstream of the LPA receptor. Together with these previous findings, this allows us to

speculate that Rho-kinase participates in MARCKS phosphorylation in neuronal cells and brain.

4. Perspectives and conclusions We have confirmed MARCKS phosphorylation in LPAand PDBu-stimulated cells in culture (Nagumo et al., 2001) and the involvement of Rho-kinase using the Rho-kinase specific inhibitor H-1152 and antibody pS159-Mar-Ab. This is the first report indicating that this Rho-kinase inhibitor targets MARCKS protein function in neuronal cells. It is likely that the phosphorylation of MARCKS regulates the actin-membrane interaction at the cell perifery in a PKC-dependent manner (Hartwig et al., 1992; Allen & Aderem, 1995), and that the release of neurotransmitters in brain preparations (Dekker et al., 1991), isolated synaptosomal preparation (Coffey et al., 1994), and cultured neuronal cells (Goodall et al., 1997) can be potentiated by short-term pretreatment with phorbol esters. This enhancement of neurotransmitter release can be prevented by inhibitors of PKC (Robinson, 1991; Goodall et al., 1997) or by down-regulation of PKC following prolonged treatment with phorbol esters (Robinson, 1991). These findings allow us to speculate that a pre-inflammatory substance, such as LPA and IL-1b, augments MARCKS phosphorylation in neuronal cells, and thereby the release of neurotransmitters through a reorganization of actin-containing microfilaments at the cell periphery. This is followed by the mobilization of neuronal vesicles to the recognized site, the so-called active zone. We have demonstrated that MARCKS may be phosphorylated through a novel mechanism that involves the LPA/Rho-kinase pathway in neuronal cells, and that H1152P clearly inhibited the Rho-kinase-induced phosphorylation of MARCKS, suggesting that H-1152P is a good tool to confirm the existence of a novel pathway in which Rho-

kinase may participate. Moreover, H-1152P may modulate or suppress the release of neurotransmitters in lesions such as an ischemic lesion in the brain (Calabresi et al., 2000) or under manic-depressive conditions (Xie & Hagan, 1998).
