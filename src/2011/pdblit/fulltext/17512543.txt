Division of Cell Biology and Biophysics, School of Biological Sciences, University of Missouri-Kansas City Kansas City, MO 64110-2499 USA The Zap1 transcription factor controls expression of genes that regulate zinc homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The solution structure of two zinc fingers (zf1-2CA3) derived from a zinc-responsive domain of Zap1 (zf1-2) has been determined. Under zinc-limiting conditions, zinc finger 2 (zf2) from this domain has been shown to be a constitutive transcriptional activator. Moreover, repression of zf2 function in zinc-replete cells required zinc coordination to both canonical finger 1 (zf1) and zf2 metal sites, suggesting zf1­zf2 cooperativity underlies Zap1 metalloregulation. A structural basis for this cooperativity is identified here. Favorable inter-helical contacts in zf1-2CA3 extend the individual finger hydrophobic cores through the zf1­zf2 interface. Tryptophan residues at position 5 in each finger provide numerous non-helical inter-finger contacts reminiscent of those observed in GLI1 zinc fingers 1 and 2. The molecular mechanism for zf1-dependent repression of zf2 transcriptional activation is explored further using NMR and CD titration studies. While zf1 independently forms a bba solution structure, the majority of zf2 ensemble solution states do not adopt the canonical bba zinc finger fold without zf1­zf2 interactions. Cooperative effects on Zn(II) affinities stemming from these finger­finger interactions are observed also in calorimetric studies, in which the 160(G20) nM (zf1) and 250(G40) nM (zf2) Kd values for each individual finger increased substantially in the context of the zf1-2 protein (apparent Kdzf1-2WTZ4.6(G1.2) nM). On the basis of the above observations, we propose a mechanism for Zap1 transcriptional regulation in which zf1­zf2 interactions stabilize the bba folded "repressed state" of the zf2 activation domain in the presence of cellular Zn(II) excess. Moreover, in contrast to earlier reports of /1 labile zinc ion/Escherichia coli cell, the zf1­zf2 zinc affinities determined calorimetrically are consistent with Zn(II) levels [1 labile zinc ion/eukaryotic cell.

All organisms require divalent zinc (Zn(II)). As the second most abundant biological transition metal ion in humans, Zn(II) provides a structural scaffold for many proteins such as zinc fingers, zinc clusters, and nuclear hormone receptors.1­3 An equally diverse group of functions are mediated through these metalloproteins, many of which are essential for cellular development and differentiation. Zn(II) is also an activator or co-activator in over 300 human proteins from all six classes of

1168 enzymes.4 Regulation of cellular Zn(II) levels is necessary, since this nutrient is essential but also toxic if accumulated to excess.5 Metalloregulation of Zn(II) has been observed in a wide range of organisms, including Escherichia coli, Synechococcus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, plants and mammalian cells.6­11 Zn(II)-containing transcription factor proteins that control Zn(II) homeostasis in these organisms regulate the levels of Zn(II) uptake and efflux transporters and metallothionein metal chelators.10,12­14 In E. coli, the regulation of Zn(II) appears to be precise, since the femtomolar affinity calibration of the Zur and ZntR transcriptional metalloregulators suggests that these proteins strive for a level of Zn(II) that matches exactly the number of metalbinding sites of proteins and other biomolecules within the cytoplasm at any given time. 11,13 Whether Zn(II) regulation in eukaryotic cells occurs at a level in which essentially no intracellular "labile" Zn(II) is present has not been established. However, conflicting reports of cellular levels of labile Zn(II) in eukaryotic cells over the range of 10 pM to micromolar have been suggested (/1 to w105 Zn(II) ions per cell).15­19 An understanding of eukaryotic Zn(II) homeostasis is beginning to emerge through studies involving yeast and mammalian cells.14,20 Regulation of cellular Zn(II) levels in S. cerevisiae is governed, in large part, by the Zap1 protein, which mediates the transcription of genes encoding uptake (Zrt1, Zrt2 and Fet4) and vacuolar (Zrt3 and Zrc1) transporters.6,21­25 All of these genes, and at least 40 others,26 are controlled through Zap1 induction in Zn(II)-limited cells. Zrt-like proteins that comprise the ZIP family of zinc transporters span all phylogenetic levels of eukaryotic organisms.14 Zap1 is a 93,000 Da nuclear protein that is controlled by Zn(II) at different cellular levels (Figure 1(a)). Transcriptional autoregulation restricts the copy number of Zap1.6,19 In addition, full control of Zap1 metalloregulation requires two Zn(II)-responsive domains, ZRD1 and ZRD2, which both have embedded transcriptional activation domains AD1 and AD2, as shown in Figure 1(a).19,27 Although ZRD1 and ZRD2 control of Zap1 gene expression has been established, the molecular mechanisms of these Zn(II)-dependent processes have not been reported. Seven Cys2His2 zinc fingers are located in the functionally distinct ZRD2 (zf1-2) and DNA-binding domain (zf3­7) regions of Zap1 (Figure 1). The second zinc finger of Zap1 (zf2) is an independently functioning constitutive transcriptional activation domain (AD2) when fused to a Gal4 DNA-binding domain, whereas the larger ZRD2, which encompasses zf1-2, is required for metal-induced repression of function (Figure 1).19 Here, we focus on the Zn(II)dependent molecular mechanism of transcriptional repression involving zf1-2. Although zinc finger proteins are found in more than 700 genes within the human genome, Zap1 zf1-2 appears to have unusual structural and

functional characteristics compared to most Cys2His2 zinc fingers.28,29 First, zf1-2 comprises a Zn(II)responsive transcriptional activation domain, in contrast to the canonical sequence-specific nucleic acid-binding function ascribed to the zinc finger motif within transcription factor proteins.30,31 A second unusual functional aspect of zf1-2 is an observed constitutive activity of zf2 when the Zn(II)-binding site is disrupted, and a Zn(II)repressed non-active state when both zf1 and zf2 have intact Cys2His2 sites in Zn(II)-replete cells.19 The apparent activity of apo zf2 suggested from these observations is surprising, given the fundamental relationship coupling metal binding to canonical bba folded structure.32 Although there is no precedent for functional activity of an apo zinc finger similar to that postulated for zf2, a finger­finger interaction in zf1-2 analogous to that reported for fingers 1 and 2 of the five-finger GLI1­DNA complex33 has been proposed recently by Eide and co-workers.19 A regulatory role for the putative "two-finger" zf1­2 structure in Zap1 was predicted from an observed loss of Zn(II)-mediated repression of zf2 transcriptional activation when either W583 (zf1) or W620 (zf2) was mutated to alanine. These tryptophan residues are not part of the Cys2His2 zinc finger consensus, and both are at position 5 relative to the N terminus of the respective fingers. Tryptophan residues at position 5 likewise stabilize the two-finger interaction in GLI1 fingers 1 and 2. The high-resolution solution structure ensemble reported here for Zap1 zf1-2CA3 provides a detailed

1169 line-widths were broad for a 65 residue protein (Figure 2(a)). The zf1-2WT residue numbers used here encompass only N-terminal to C-terminal residues of the two Zap1 zinc fingers comprising the transcriptional activation domain protein construct studied here (L3­H65; see Figure 1(b) for sequence number correlation with full-length protein). Backbone 1HN­15NH resonances corresponding to K6, N43, W44, and V58 were not present in the spectra. In addition, resonances corresponding to G51­I57 located in the vicinity of the N-terminal canonical zf2 a-helix were weak due to extreme exchange broadening. A comparison of backbone and side-chain 13Cb chemical shifts to those of random coil is generally indicative of secondary structure predictions for two canonical Cys2His2 zinc fingers motifs (Figure 3).34 A notable exception to this prediction is found in the N-terminal region of the canonical zf2 a-helix (residues T54­I57), which appears to lack ordered secondary structure (30% black shaded region in Figure 3). This disorder in the zf2 N-terminal a-helix, and overall broadening of many zf1-2WT resonances made high-resolution structure calculation difficult due to a paucity of observable nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) inter-proton distance

structural basis for the first reported example of an independently folded non-canonical interacting two-finger domain structure. NMR and CD studies uncover mechanistic insights into the repression of zf2 transcriptional activation by zf1 resulting from structural interdependence of zf2 structure on zf1­ zf2 interactions. Calorimetric measurements on single-finger and two-finger Zap1 zf1­2 proteins reveal a corresponding cooperative Zn(II) binding stabilization resulting from zf1­zf2 interactions. Significantly, calibration of the zf1-2 metallosensor is consistent with labile Zn(II) levels in S. cerevisiae cells that are significantly greater than those proposed for E. coli.13

restraints. The reduced spectral quality was determined not to be caused by cysteine thiolate oxidation for reasons described below. First, all seven cysteine residues in zf1-2WT were assigned, with 13Cb chemical shifts indicative of reduced thiol groups. Specifically, 13Cb atoms in zf1-2WT were 28­33 ppm (Table S1 of Supplementary Data), which contradicts typical oxidized cystine 13Cb values of w42 ppm. Second, no unassigned "extra" resonances corresponding to oxidized cysteine residues were observed in the NMR spectra. Third, measured NMR peak patterns and intensities were very consistent between initial spectra and those recorded a week later. Finally, all NMR samples contained 500 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) as a reducing agent. Rather than cysteine thiol oxidation, low-affinity transient Zn(II) binding to the three non-canonical

cysteine residues (boxed in Figure 3) was suspected as a contributing factor to the exchange broadening in the zf1­zf2WT NMR spectra. Therefore, a mutant zf1-2 protein (zf1-2CA3) in which the non-canonical cysteine residues were replaced by alanine (C14A, C55A, and C63A) was constructed with the expectation of obtaining higher-quality NMR spectra for structure calculation. Indeed, all spectra of zf1-2CA3 were of superior quality to zf1-2WT in terms of line-width and signal-to-noise ratio (Figure 2(a)). Although 1H­15N resonances corresponding to residues K6, N43 and W44 were still undetectably broadened, residues in the N-terminal region of zf2 were characterized by line-widths similar to those of other residues of zf1-2CA3 (for backbone and side-chain assignments, see Supplementary Data, Table S2). The chemical shift comparisons in Figure 3 show clearly that zf1-2WT and zf1-2CA3 proteins have nearly identical structures, except for

1171 Zf1-2 forms an interacting two-finger structure A summary of structural statistics for an ensemble of the 20 lowest energy structures of zf12CA3 is presented in Table 1, with overlaid stereo backbone traces illustrated in Figure 4. While the individual zinc finger peptides are well defined ° (backbone RMSD %0.30 A), the linker connecting zf1 and zf2 (V29­P39) is characterized by greater ensemble fluctuations (Figure 4). We note that only w2.5 medium/long-range NOEs per residue were detected in the linker region, so the ensemble variation in calculated linker structures is not unexpected. Close inspection of the individual zf1 and zf2 hydrophobic cores reveals that canonical residue side-chains adopt predicted stabilizing interactions (Figure 5(a) and (b)).29 In zf2, the F49 aromatic ring stacks with the H60 imidazole ring in a face-to-face arrangement, while the I57­L40 and L40­T54 methyl­methyl contacts contribute to zf2 core stabilizations. It does seem likely that the I57­ L40 methyl­methyl contacts may be absent from zf1-2WT, since I57 is in the D53-I57 canonical N-terminal a-helical region of zf2 that is disordered in the wild-type two-finger protein (Figure 3). Parallel L3­L20 and L3­L17 methyl­methyl packing arrangements are observed in zf1. However, the Phe/Tyr residue located at position 10 or 12 in canonical Cys2His2 zinc fingers is absent from zf1, which precludes an aromatic­imidazole stacking arrangement similar to that observed in zf2 (H60F49). Additional, non-canonical indole­imidazole face-to-face stacking arrangements involving H28­ W7 (zf1) and H65­W44 (zf2) shown in Figure 5(a) and (b) further stabilizes each individual finger. Domain order in multi-zinc finger proteins in the DNA-free state are often described by a beads on a string model, in which adjacent fingers that are tethered by short peptide linkers have an ensemble of allowed finger­finger orientations.35 Juxtaposed to this canonical model, the Zap1 zf1 and zf2 fingers

In contrast to zf1-2WT, the N-terminal region of the zf12CA3 zf2 a-helix is structurally well defined (compare 13Ca and 13CO shift differences in the 30% black region of Figure 3). Since observable zf2 NOE cross-peaks were more abundant in appropriate NMR spectra recorded for zf1-2CA3 compared to zf1-2WT, solution structure studies were carried out on the structurally similar zf1-2CA3 protein.

form a highly ordered interacting solution structure, in which the hydrophobic cores of the individual fingers are extended to the zf1­zf2 interface through an extensive network of hydrophobic contacts. In total, 41 unique inter-finger NOEs were observed between zf1 and zf2 (representative data are shown in Figure 6, with a complete list available as Table S3 in Supplementary Data). Stabilization of the zf1­zf2 extended hydrophobic core that effectively "locks in" the interdomain orientation stems from multiple sources, as depicted in Figure 5(c). First, L24-I61 and L25-V58 methyl groups comprise the majority of zf1­zf2 inter-helical contacts. Second, the two non-canonical W7 (zf1) and W44 (zf2) residues form close contacts with each other, in addition to neighboring

L24, H28, I61 and H65 residues from both fingers. Additional zf1­zf2 stabilization is contributed by V29­L40 methyl­methyl contacts (technically, V29 is the first zf1-2 linker residue), although no other interaction involving linker residue side-chains is observed. The very small NMR backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shift differences between zf1-2CA3 and zf1-2WT (Figure 3) point directly to a very similar two-finger structure for the wild-type protein. Moreover, the distinct apo and Zn(II)bound W7 and W44 indole 1H3­15N3 side-chain resonances shown in Figure 2(b) are nearly identical in zf1-2WT and zf1-2CA3, which shows clearly that the same two distinct folded and unfolded chemical environments exist for these tryptophan residues in the core of the zf1­zf2 interface.

Zf2 bba stabilization requires zf1­zf2 inter-finger contacts The coupling of Zn(II) binding with stable canonical bba folding in naturally occurring Cys2His2 zinc fingers is well established.32 Moreover, numerous reports of single zinc finger bba solution structures suggest that individual fingers within most multi-zinc finger proteins adopt a bba fold that is independent of neighboring zinc finger modules.34,36­38 Given the unusual zf1­2 two-finger structure identified here, and the reported interdependence of intact zf1 and zf2 metal-binding sites for Zn(II)-mediated repression of zf2 transcriptional activation,19 the structural independence of each zf1­zf2 finger was investigated as a possible mechanistic basis for functional regulation of zf2 activity. NMR and CD titration studies were carried out with two mutant zf1­zf2 proteins in which the two canonical cysteine residues were mutated to alanine in zf1 (zf1-2F1KO) or zf2 (zf1-2F2KO) to effectively "knock out" high-affinity Zn(II) binding. Consistent with the canonical zinc finger model, zf1 adopted a similar Zn(II)-induced structural conversions to a bba fold in the zf1-2WT, zf1-2CA3, and zf12F2KO contexts, as determined by the similarity of resonances corresponding to zf1 residues in 1H­15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of all three proteins (Figure 2(a)). As expected, backbone 1H­15N resonances corresponding to zf2 in zf1-2F2KO HSQC spectra were broadened and not consistent with a folded zf2

resonances in zf1-2WT, since both zf2 cysteine Zn(II) ligands were converted to alanine. Efforts to express recombinant zf1 and zf2 peptides were unsuccessful. However, a longer recombinant polypeptide encompassing residues 1­39 of zf1-2WT (zf1L) was produced in a 15N, 13Clabeled form. A suite of NMR triple resonance spectra of the labeled zf1L protein were recorded and analyzed to obtain backbone 1HN, 15N, 13C, and side-chain 13Cb NMR resonance assignments (Table S4 of Supplementary Data), although 1HN­15NH resonances corresponding to zf1 residues K6­E9 and H28 were broadened beyond detection. A chemical shift comparison of assigned zf1L and zf1-2WT chemical shifts presented in Figure 7 shows clearly that zf1 adopts a similar fold in the absence and in the presence of zf2. Close inspection of W7 and W44 indole 1H3­15N3 side-chain resonances for zf1-2WT, zf1-2CA3, zf1-2F1KO, and zf1-2F2KO shown in Figure 2(b) further indicates that a distinct chemical environment in the presence and in the absence of Zn(II) exists only in the zf1-2WT and zf1-2CA3 proteins, which have both intact metal-binding sites. CD Zn(II) titration studies of zf1-2WT, zf12F2KO, zf1L, and a synthetically produced zf1 peptide summarized in Figure 8 reveal Zn(II)induced negative mean molar residue ellipticity at 222 nm ([Q]MRE222) in all of these polypeptides. This [Q]MRE222 change is indicative of a-helix formation, which is a major component of the canonical bba zinc finger fold. We note that the Zn(II)-induced [Q]MRE222 change for zf1 was somewhat less than

that observed for the other larger proteins. Interestingly, the single finger polypeptides (zf1 and zf1L) seemed to undergo extensive structural transitions, which could be attributed to Zn(II)-induced unfolding or aggregation in the presence of a stoichiometric excess of Zn(II).39 By contrast to the structural independence of zf1, addition of stoichiometric Zn(II) to the zf1-2F1KO protein resulted in significant broadening of most apo resonances in the 1H­15N HSQC spectrum, without the appearance of resonances corresponding to residues within either folded zf1 or zf2 finger (Figure 2(a)). CD titration studies of zf1-2F1KO and a synthetic peptide corresponding to zf2 were consistent with a mostly unfolded protein at stoichiometric levels of Zn(II), despite the appearance of some induced a-helical content in zf1-2F1KO at higher stoichiometries of Zn(II) (Figure 8). Although still under investigation, one possible

explanation for the zf1-2F1KO CD data in Figure 8(a) is that the zf1 helix (and possibly zf2 helix) forms once the two histidine imidazole ligands from one and/or two zinc finger polypeptides coordinate Zn(II) at excess metal:ligand stoichiometries. Notwithstanding this higher stoichiometry a-helical structure, the NMR and CD Zn(II) titration data show collectively that the majority of zf2 solution ensemble states do not adopt a stable canonical bba fold in the absence of a zf1 domain with an intact Zn(II) binding site. Cooperative zf1­zf2 interactions stabilize Zn(II)-binding in zf1-2 Potential cooperative effects on Zn(II) binding affinities for the canonical zf1 and zf2 sites were investigated using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). For these studies, Zn(II) titration isotherms

NMR Structure of a Zap1 Metalloregulatory Domain

1175 were tested, since there are two distinct highaffinity Zn(II) sites (one per finger). The only variable constraint used for the two-site model non-linear, least-squares minimization of zf1-2CA3 was the condition that n1Zn2, where n1 and n2 are the Zn(II):protein stoichiometries for zf1 and zf2 sites, respectively. The individual finger Kd values calculated using the two-site model were very similar to each other, and slightly weaker than the apparent affinity of the two sites combined. However, due to the increased complexity of the two-site model (twice the number of variables), and to the similarity of Kd1 and Kd2, the uncertainties of the two-site experimental fits for zf1-2CA3 were typically larger than the fitted Kd values measured, and thus statistically insignificant. However, we mention the results of these analyses here, since the standard error of the calculated Kd1 and Kd2 values from five experimental runs was much lower (Kd1Z 10.5(G1.2) nM and K d2Z12.8G(3.6) nM), and because the high level of uncertainty in Kd1 and Kd2 for zf1-2CA3 is due, in large part, to (and thus corroborates) the similarity of the individual affinities within each zf1-2 finger. By contrast to zf1-2CA3, the two-site non-linear, least-squares analysis of the zf1-2WT, zf1 and zf2 proteins, which contained one population of canonical high-affinity sites (H) and one population of non-canonical single cysteine-bound low-affinity sites (L), produced reproducible high-affinity apparent K 0 dH values for all three proteins with relatively low levels of uncertainty (Table 2). These H/L site deconvolutions were possible because of the O500-fold difference between the apparent Kd values of the canonical (H) and non-canonical (L) Zn(II)-binding sites. For the two-site analyses of zf12WT, in which all variables (nH, nL, KH, KL, DHH, DHL, DSH, and DSL) were allowed to vary, a nL/nH ratio of 1.7 was calculated (Table 2), which is very close to the theoretical ratio of 1.5 for two highaffinity structural tetrahedral zinc finger sites and three low-affinity single cysteine residues (Figure 1(b)). For the zf1 and zf2 proteins, the lowaffinity Kd values were not well determined if all variables were allowed to vary in the non-linear, least-squares fitting procedure. Therefore, for these

were measured for synthetic peptides corresponding to zf1 (residues 3­28) and zf2 (residues 40­65), in addition to the recombinant zf1-2CA3 and zf1-2WT proteins. The results summarized in Table 2 represent averaged data from at least three separate experiments per protein. Representative titration isotherms for all four proteins are provided in Figure 9. After saturation of the canonical tetrahedral zf1 and zf2 Zn(II)-binding sites was reached, a secondary, lower affinity endothermic binding profile contributed by the non-canonical cysteine residues was observed in zf1-2WT, zf1, and zf2 over and above the heat of dilution. The source of the endothermic binding is clear upon comparison of the regions of Figure 9(a) to those of Figure 9(b)­(d) after high-affinity Zn(II)-binding saturation at w2 (zf1-2 WT) or w1 (zf1 and zf2) molar Zn(II) equivalents. Consistent with the NMR structural data presented, the apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) and binding enthalpies for zf1-2WT and zf1-2CA3 were very similar.

single finger proteins, nL was set to nH and 2(nH) corresponding to the expected high/low-affinity binding site ratios for zf1 (one non-canonical cysteine residue) and zf2 (two non-canonical cysteine residues), respectively. A contributing factor to the fitting difficulty was the lack of saturation in the isotherms at high Zn(II) stoichiometries. Close inspection of the zf1-2CA3 NMR solution structure reveals that all three mutated alanine side-chains at positions corresponding to cysteine residues in zf1-2WT face out into

the solvent. These alanine side-chains are also well-separated from each other and from the canonical cysteine and histidine Zn(II) ligands, and are incapable of forming a cooperative Zn(II)binding site without considerable conformational change in the protein. A more likely explanation than cooperative effects for the 15­20-fold tighter measured KdL values for zf1-2WT compared to zf1 and zf2 (Table 2) resides in the observation from Figure 8(b) that zf1 and zf2 appear to unfold or aggregate at high Zn(II) stoichiometries, which is

1177 domain from Zap1 provide a basis from which a molecular mechanism for Zn(II)-mediated repression of transcription in S. cerevisiae that is consistent with in vivo observations can be synthesized.19 This mechanism is a paradigm for regulation of yeast zrt gene expression, which is an important component of the more elaborate eukaryotic Zn(II) homeostasis machinery involving a complex interplay between transcription factors, Zn(II) transporter proteins, and other factors.40 In a broader sense, the quantitative determination of the zf1-2 finger affinities provide one approach to calibrate the in vivo concentration of accessible or "labile" zinc sensed by the Zap1 metalloregulatory transcription factor in S. cerevisiae. Comparison of the zf1-2CA3, GLI1, and MBP-1 two-finger structures At least three examples of biologically significant cooperative interactions between single zinc fingers and accessory secondary structural motifs have been observed.29 Moreover, structural and dynamic solution studies of adjacent canonical Cys2His2 zinc fingers in the DNA-free state suggest that packing interfaces exist in some multi-finger proteins, which produce ensemble averaged extended zinc finger structures.41­43 A cartoon of one ensemble member of the human enhancer binding protein MBP-1 zinc finger 1-2 (mf1-2) solution structure is shown in Figure 10(a) (structure 1 from PDB entry 1BBO).41

observed only nominally for the two-finger zf1-2CA3 and zf1-2WT proteins (Figure 8(a)). Therefore, the zf1 and zf2 isotherms observed at high Zn(II) to protein ratios are reflecting a more complex molecular process than metal­ligand binding. As a result of this complexity, and of the lack of a canonical bba fold for the majority of zf2 ensemble states, insufficient information is available to quantitatively interpret the directly measured enthalpies of Zn(II) binding between single and two-finger Zap1 proteins. However, when considered in the context of the approximation discussed in the previous paragraph of nearly identical zf1 and zf2 KdH values in the zf1-2WT protein, 35-fold and 50-fold increases in Zn(II) affinities compared to the isolated fingers are contributed by cooperative finger­finger interactions for zf1 and zf2, respectively (Table 2).

Discussion
Since the only other structurally similar twofinger motif identified previously (gf1-2) consisted of the two N-terminal fingers from the larger GLI1 five-finger domain complex with DNA,33 the zf12CA3 solution structure reported here establishes for the first time the independence of this noncanonical interacting Cys2His2 two-finger arrangement in at least one context. More significantly, these studies of the zf1-2 transcriptional activation

(a) The more extended arrangement of mf1-2 (structure 1 from PDB entry 1BBO), in which side-chain interactions forming the finger 1­2 interface involving residues from finger 1 (red), finger 2 (green), and the linker (gray) are indicated and annotated. In (b), amino acid side-chains from finger 1 (red), finger 2 (green), and the linker (gray) that appear to stabilize the gf1-2 two-finger structure (PDB entry 2GLI) are shown. Although portrayed here as an isolated two-finger domain for clarity, the X-ray structure from which the gf1-2 cartoon structure was derived consisted of Co(II)-bound GLI fingers 1­5 in complex with DNA (metal ligands are not included in the PDB entry). In the GLI-DNA structure, only fingers 2­5 made contact with the DNA.

1178 Notwithstanding the ensemble domain order in this and some other canonical zinc finger proteins, the discovery of the interacting gf1-2 two-finger domain (Figure 10(b)) within the five-finger GLI1 complex with DNA over ten years ago was a significant structural departure from the norm for Cys2His2 family members. Therefore, the availability of the "gf1-2-like" zf1-2 CA3 structure reported here provides a preliminary basis to evaluate similarities and differences in these noncanonical interacting two-finger domains, which have been identified recently as members of a distinct structural and evolutionary class within the larger Cys2His2 zinc finger family with over 150 members spanning a broad array of organisms (G.J. Wyckoff & J.H.L., unpublished results). Relative zf1-2CA3 and gf1-2 finger­finger orientations were assessed in two ways using the MOLMOL package:44 (i) the pairwise RMSD was ° 1.37 A for all backbone atoms within the two helices of each protein; and (ii) the inter-helical angles for zf1-2CA3 and gf1-2 were determined to be 1318 and 1568, respectively, reflecting the similar "antiparallel" nature of the helix-stacking interactions in each two-finger motif. Helix-stacking angles are defined by the angle bisecting the two N-to-Cterminal vectors aligned parallel with each long helical axis. These two-finger stacking angles were within the range observed for Sso1p,45 interleukin19,46 and calbindin D9k47 helix bundle proteins (1218­1718). The most obvious inter-helical close contacts in gf1-2 shown in Figure 10(b) involved I125-M161, which are in residue positions identical with those of L24­I61 in zf1-2CA3 (Figure 5(c)). A second inter-helical stabilization arises from I131­V158, for which no identical residue­residue contact is found in zf1-2CA3 (I131 is the first linker residue C-terminal to the helix in finger 1 of gf1-2). The two tryptophan indole groups at residue position 5 in each finger of gf1-2 (W108 and W141) likewise form numerous inter-finger contacts, some of which are analogous to those observed in zf12CA3, (Figure 5(c)), including contacts with I125 and M161 (Figure 10(b)). However, the orientations of the tryptophan indole groups in gf1-2 suggest less favorable stacking distances and orientations with the second histidine imidazole metal ligand (H129 and H164) in both fingers (compare Figures 3(c) and 10(b)). Although the residue position 5 tryptophan is an invariant consensus for the non-canonical twofinger class of Cys2His2 zinc fingers (G. J. Wyckoff & J.H.L., unpublished results), both proteins have different regions of inserted non-canonical amino acid residues (the linker region in zf1-2CA3 and the second b-hairpin in gf1-2), which nonetheless affect the relative orientations of the tryptophan indole groups. Despite the modest variations between zf1-2CA3 and gf1-2 in terms of which residues and residue orientations contribute to inter-finger stabilization, the zf1-2 and gf1-2 proteins clearly have a similar overall finger­finger arrangement that is distinctly different from that of the canonical mf1-2 two-finger

motif. There is essentially no helix­helix interface in mf1-2, and no residue position 5 tryptophan residue in each finger to participate in inter-finger interactions (Figure 10(a)). Indeed, the mf1-2 finger­ finger interface is formed by hydrophobic contacts between T23 (C terminus of finger 1), V27 (linker residue), and K40 (the b2-a1 region of finger 2), with 3 additional hydrogen bonds between K40(Nx HC)­ T23(O gH) and T23(backbone CO)­R28(guanidinium) observed in some of the 60 structural ensemble members reported.41 As a direct comparison to the similarity of helix­helix orientations within the zf1-2 and gf1-2 proteins described above, the pairwise RMSD for all backbone atoms within ° zf1-2CA3 and mf1-2 was 10.0 A for the two helices of each protein, while the finger 1-2 inter-helical angle in mf1-2 of 49.38 differs by 858 and 1078 from that of zf1-2 and gf1-2, respectively. Mechanistic insights into Zn(II)-mediated repression of zf1-2 transcriptional activation Previous in vivo studies involving chimeric transcription reporter proteins with different regions of zf1-2 as the transcriptional activator mapped the minimal AD2 activation domain to the endpoints of zf2.19 Mutants of zf1-2 (ZRD2) that abolished either Zn(II) binding site or replaced either tryptophan at residue position 5 rendered zf1-2 constitutively active (mutant ZRD2 is not Zn(II)-responsive). The NMR and CD results presented here show that the zf2 activation domain is relatively unstructured in the Zn(II)-deficient state prior to interaction with cognate factors involved in transcription (Figures 2(a) and 8). Moreover, the lack of zf2 structure as an isolated finger in the presence of stoichiometric Zn(II) suggests that repression of zf2 transcriptional activation requires the stable interacting two-finger bba structures of zf1-2 to block zf2 interactions with cognate transcription factors. However, the similarity of intrinsic zf1 and zf2 Kd values (Table 2), the cooperative metal site binding affinities for each zf12 finger, and the poor fit resulting from "sequential" ITC binding models (data not shown), collectively suggest that inhibition of AD2 does not strictly follow a sequential zf1/zf2 Zn(II) ion-binding process. Although possible contributing factors are discussed below, a quantitative energetic basis for the unusual instability of the isolated zf2 folded structure is still under investigation. Since the hydrophobic core of zf2 has a remarkably canonical structure (Figure 5(b)), it seems unlikely that residues comprising this core shown in Figure 5(b) are significant direct contributors to zf2 destabilization. However, the five non-canonical acidic residues surrounding the second cysteine ligand in zf2 (E45, D46, D47, D52, and D53; Figure 1(b)) could function to destabilize the Zn(II)-dependent folding state through an increased cysteinyl pKa.48,49 The unusually large number of polar residues in zf2 and the presumably solvent-exposed zf1­zf2 interface

containing W44 in the isolated zf2 finger, also point to a lower than average enthalpic contribution expected from a reduction in the exposed apolar surface area upon folding.50 In addition, the surface exposed side-chain positions of these acidic residues in the folded zf1-2CA3 structure (not shown) suggest a relatively low enthalpic contribution to folding stabilization. However, the orientations of the acidic carboxylate groups of these residues are not favorable for direct reduction of bond forming stability between Zn(II) and the cysteine residue,37,51 nor are they favorable for secondary hydrogen bonding effects involving cysteinyl groups that could destabilize Cys2His2 coordination to Zn(II).52,53 Finally, it is worth noting that the acidic residues clustered in zf2 could potentially interact with the cognate regulatory factors in either the apo-activated or Zn(II)-repressed folded states, as has been observed for other transcriptional activation domains.54­56 Biological implications of a nanomolar Zn(II) sensor in S. cerevisiae Notwithstanding the thermodynamic basis for the isolated zf2 domain instability in the Zn(II)bound state, the observation is somewhat surprising, given the seminal relationship coupling Zn(II) binding to canonical bba Cys2His2 zinc finger folded structure.32,34 From a biological function perspective, however, the cooperative interactions between zf1-2 domains may provide a necessary basis from which to achieve transcriptional activity and repression at Zn(II) levels optimal for cellular functioning. Since canonical Cys2His2 zinc fingers that fold independently typically have tight Zn(II) binding (Kd values of 10K9­10K12 MK1),57,58 the zf12WT Zn(II) affinities in the low end of this range are consistent with a de-tuned sensor that is activated once canonical structural Zn(II) sites within zinc fingers and other higher affinity metalloproteins are saturated. It should be noted that zf1-2 Kd values of 0.3(G0.1) nM and 5.3(G2.2) nM reported previously using a spectroscopic Zn(II) competition assay19 differ somewhat from our report of two very similar affinity sites in the low nanomolar range. However, given the requirement of Zn(II) binding to both zf1-2 fingers for repression of zf2 transcriptional activation, both reported calibrations of the zf1-2 affinities lead to the same in vivo Zn(II) responsive range in the low nanomolar range. At least 100 labile Zn(II) ions per whole yeast cell is the estimate obtained from a Zn(II) responsive concentration of 5!10K9 M suggested from Table 1 (Kd equals half saturation of Zn(II) binding), assuming a yeast nuclear volume of 6!10K15 l is 6% of the total cellular volume.19 Compared to the femtomolar calibration of the E. coli ZntR and Zur Zn(II) sensors reported previously,13 these studies of the Zap1 sensor from S. cerevisiae would seem to suggest that labile Zn(II) ion levels in eukaryotic cells may be orders of magnitude above the !1 Zn(II) ion per cell reported for E. coli.

Materials and Methods
Gene design and plasmid construction The DNA sequence encoding residues D578-H641 of Zap1 (Figure 1) was PCR amplified with NdeI and EcoRI restriction ends from DNA plasmid pYeF2ZAP1 (a gift from D.J Eide, University of Wisconsin, Madison). The 1% (w/v) agarose gel-purified PCR fragments were digested with restriction enzymes and ligated into the NdeI and EcoRI site of a similarly digested and gel-purified pET-21a(C) DNA plasmid (Novagen) to form the p21a_zf1-2WT expression construct. An identical PCR-based approach was used to make the p21a_zf1, p21a_zf1L, and p21a_zf2 plasmids, except that DNA sequences encoding residues D578­H604, D578­P615, and P615­H641, respectively, were used. The p21a_zf1-2WT DNA vector was used as a template for PCRbased mutagenesis to make the p21a_zf1-2CA3, p21a_zf12F1KO, and p21a_zf1-2F2KO plasmids to express the mutant zf1-2 proteins. Data provided by the University of Kansas Medical Center Biotechnology Support Facility and the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Biological Sciences (UMKC-SBS) Genomics Facility were used to verify all plasmid DNA sequences in both strand directions. Protein expression, purification and characterization All DNA plasmids were transformed into competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The p21a_zf1-2WT, p21a_zf1L and p21a_zf1-2CA3, p21a_zf1-2F1KO, and p21a_zf1-2F2KO plasmids expressed soluble protein in sufficient quantities for NMR analysis. By contrast, attempts to recover recombinant protein from bacteria expressing the single Zap1 zinc finger p21a_zf1 and p21a_zf2 plasmids were unsuccessful. A single colony of bacteria was used to inoculate 20 ml of Luria broth supplemented with 200 mg/ml of ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 8C (w14­16 h). The inoculant cells were pelleted by gentle centrifugation at 2500 rpm (1272 g) using a Sorvall BIOshield 18.2 cm radius rotor and resuspended in 1 l of minimal medium (1.28% (w/v) Na2HPO4, 0.3% (w/v) KH2PO4, 0.05% (w/v) NaCl, 1 mM MgSO4 , 1 mM CaCl 2) containing 50 mg/ml of ampicillin, trace metals and 10 mg/l of thiamine. Uniform (U) isotopic enrichment of the medium was obtained by using either 0.5 g/l of 14 NH4Cl or U-15NH4Cl and either 1 g/l of [12C]glucose or 1 g/l of [U-13C]glucose when producing (U-15N), (U-13C) (zf1-2CA3 only) or (U-15N, 13C)-labeled proteins. All cultures were grown at 37 8C (except zf1L at 30 8C) to A600w0.8, induced with 1 mM isopropyl-b,D-thiogalactopyranoside, spiked with an additional 50 mM ZnCl2 or ZnSO4 at induction, and grown for another 1.5­2 h before harvest. Cultures were then centrifuged at 6000 rpm (6084 g) for 20 min at 4 8C using a Sorvall SLA-3000 rotor and resuspended in lysis buffer (0.4% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 20% (v/v) acetonitrile). Cells were lysed by sonication and the soluble protein was separated from the insoluble lysate by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm (38,724 g) for 30 min using a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The soluble protein was filtered and loaded onto a preparative 40 mm !100 mm ° Waters Delta-Pak 300 A pore-size C18 HPLC column pre-equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 20% acetonitrile. A linear 20%­50% (v/v) acetonitrile gradient was applied to the HPLC column at 1.5% per min, whereby the Zap1 zinc finger proteins eluted in the range of 32­37% acetonitrile.

1180
Fractions of the eluted proteins were screened by analytical HPLC with a 4.6 mm!75 mm Waters Symmetry 3.5 mm pore-size C18 column using a mobile phase and linear acetonitrile gradient identical with that described above. The fractions containing pure protein were pooled and lyophilized. The final purified yield of proteins ranged from 3­25 mg protein/l of cell culture, depending on the Zap1 protein construct. Protein concentrations were determined by measuring UV absorbance at 280 nm using a Varian Cary100 spectrophotometer. Extinction coefficients and concentration determinations for ITC experiments were obtained through amino acid analysis at the W.M. Keck Facility at Yale University. A purity of O95% was estimated for each protein sample using SDS-PAGE and analytical HPLC. Undetectable residual Zn(II) levels from 100 mM Zap1 protein samples as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Varian AA400, w1 ppm Zn(II) threshold) corresponded to !0.1 molar equivalent of Zn(II) per 1 mol of zinc finger protein (zf1-2WT, zf1-2CA3, zf1-2F1KO, zf1-2F2KO, zf1L, zf1, and zf2) in all apo preparations. ZnSO4 stock solutions were calibrated using atomic absorption spectroscopy. NMR spectroscopy Mass spectrometry confirmed essentially complete 15N and 13C isotopic enrichment of the Zap1 zinc finger proteins (UMKC-SBS Proteomics Facility). All NMR samples were prepared from lyophilized protein that was dissolved in argon-saturated d10-2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (Mes) pH 6.9 with 5% (v/v) 2H2O (or 99% (v/v) 2H2O for NOESY experiments), 0.2 mM 2,2dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid, 1 mM NaN3, 0.5 mM TCEP. All Zn(II)-bound proteins were treated with 1.1 molar equivalents of Zn(II) per canonical Cys2His2 metal-binding site. All NMR sample protein concentrations were 0.5­0.8 mM, except for zf1L, which was soluble to only w0.3 mM. NMR sample tubes were equilibrated with argon then sealed with an airtight cap. All NMR data were recorded on a 14.1 T Varian Inova spectrometer (599.7 MHz for 1H, 150.8 MHz for 13C, and 60.78 MHz for 15N). NMR spectra described below were recorded at 20 8C. Standard double and triple resonance spectra were used to assign the backbone 1HN, 15NH, 13C, and side-chain 13 b C resonances for the zf1-2WT, zf1-2CA3, and zf1L proteins.59 Specifically, 1H­ 15 N-HSQC, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCA, HNCO, and (HCA)CO(CA)NH spectra were recorded using water flip-back methods,60,61 and/or 15N-gradient coherence selection with sensitivity enhancement for solvent suppression.62 A 3D HNHA spectrum provided 1Ha resonance assignments for zf12WT and zf1-2CA3, which used a homonuclear HN­Ha 3Jcoupling dephasing delay (x) of 12.5 ms as described.63 The aliphatic side-chain assignments of (U-13C)-labeled zf1-2CA3 were obtained from 3D CT-HCCH-correlated spectroscopy and HCCH-total correlated spectroscopy spectra using mixing times of 100 ms. The backbone assignments for zf1-2F1KO (indole only) and zf1-2F2KO annotated in Figure 2 were inferred from corresponding zf1-2WT, zf1-2CA3, and zf1L resonance assignments provided in the Supplementary Data. 1H­1H NOE distance restraints for zf1-2CA3 were obtained from 3D 15 N and 13C-edited NOESY experiments (150 ms mixing times), the latter of which was recorded twice with the carbon frequency centered on the aliphatic and aromatic regions (see Supplementary Data, Table S3 for inter-finger NOE restraints).

For all of the NMR spectra, the proton carrier was set to the water frequency to reduce the amplitude of spurious water echoes. In the above experiments, 512 complex points were acquired in the direct 1H dimension, while 128, 64, and 45 complex increments were recorded, where appropriate, for the 1H, 13C, and 15N indirect dimensions, respectively. All NMR data processing and analysis was carried out with the NMRPipe and NMRView software packages, respectively.64,65 Forward linear prediction was used in all spectra recorded with constant time evolution to double the time domain. All indirect dimensions were zero-filled to 256 complex points and apodized with a sinebell-squared window function prior to Fourier transformation. Random coil NMR chemical shift values are those reported by Wishart et al.66,67 Referencing for 1H was internal relative to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5sulfonic acid, while 15N and 13C referencing was external according to standard procedures.68 NMR structure calculation of zf1-2CA3 Zf1-2CA3 structural restraints were generated from inter-proton distances derived from the 13C-edited NOESY spectra described above, in addition to f and j constraints obtained from an analysis of 1HN, 15NH, 1Ha, 13 a 13 b C , C , and 13CO chemical shifts using the TALOS package (NMR structural statistics are summarized in Table 1).69 Structure calculations, which started from an extended structure, were carried out using the CNS package.70 The annealing protocol was employed as follows: (i) torsion angle molecular dynamics high temperature annealing was carried out at 70,000 K with 1000 molecular dynamic steps; (ii) followed by torsion angle molecular dynamics cooling from 70,000 K to 0 K, with 15,000 steps of 15 fs each; (iii) followed by Cartesian cooling with 3000 steps of 5 fs, in which the annealing temperature was lowered from 1000 K to 0 K; (iv) and, finally, 200 minimization steps were employed. Metal­ligand dihedral angles of 109.58 were added to an in-house zinc patch file used for the calculation. For the final zf1-2CA3 ensemble, a set of 50 structures was calculated from which 20 structures were selected according to the lowest overall energy calculated from CNS. The quality of structures was assessed using the PROCHECK-NMR package.71 Isothermal titration calorimetry Isothermal titration calorimetry was carried out using a MicroCal VP-ITC (Northhamptom, MA). The zf1-2WT, zf1-2CA3, zf1, and zf2 proteins were resuspended in 200 mM Mes (pH 6.9) with 100 mM TCEP (zf1 and zf2) and 500 mM TCEP (zf1-2WT and zf1-2CA3) using Chelexw (Bio-Rad)-treated water, which was saturated with argon and subsequently vacuum degassed. The use of TCEP in the cell and syringe buffers reproducibly produced the theoretical Zn(II)/protein stoichiometry (nH, Table 2) between 1.7 and 2.0, although an identical K d was measured for the same finger within the w10% experimental uncertainty without TCEP (nH of 1.4­1.7 in repeated measurements). The very similar Kd values that were measured with or without TCEP demonstrate that this non-thiol-containing reducing agent keeps the zinc finger cysteine residues in a reduced state, but has negligible Zn(II) binding competition with the Zap1 zinc finger proteins. ZnSO4 stock solutions were prepared from the same buffer used for the protein solutions. The pH of each protein and zinc solution was adjusted to

6.90G0.02 prior to the titration when needed. In a typical experiment, 2­4 ml of 0.50­1.0 mM ZnSO4 solution was titrated into the 1.4294 ml sample cell containing an apo zf1-2-derived protein solution ranging in concentration from 0.011 mM to 0.044 mM. Protein solutions were held at 30 8C, and the sample cell mixing speed was 290 rpm. ITC curves were fitted and analyzed using the MicroCal Origin ITC package (v7.0552) supplied with the instrument. Heats of dilution were calculated from titrations in which ZnSO4 solutions were added to a matched buffer solution. Background heats of dilution were subtracted from experimental titration data before thermographs were analyzed.

Circular dichroism spectroscopy Far-UV CD measurements were performed using a PiStar-180 (Applied Photophysics) spectrometer operating at 25 8C. All measurements were recorded using a cylindrical 1 mm path-length Suprasil quartz cell (Hellma). Zinc finger proteins were dissolved in fresh argon-saturated deionized Milli-Q water. All protein samples were between 5 mM and 16 mM in 1 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.90G0.02. Incremental Zn(II) additions to the protein samples were made using a 25 mM ZnSO4 stock solution in water. After each addition of Zn(II), the pH was readjusted in an anaerobic environment. Corrections for sample dilution arising from Zn(II) additions and pH adjustments were incorporated into calculations of protein concentration for each titration point. CD measurements were carried out at 222 nm using single-wavelength mode with 15 replicates. All data were corrected for residual solvent CD.
