ABSTRACT Lanthanide ions (Ln31), which have ionic radii similar to those of Ca21, can displace the latter in a calcium binding protein, without affecting its tertiary structure. The paramagnetic Ln31 possesses large anisotropic magnetic susceptibilities and produce pseudocontact shifts (PCSs), which have r23 dependence. The PCS can ° be seen for spins as far as 45 A from the paramagnetic ion. They aid in structure refinement of proteins by providing long-range distance constraints. Besides, they can be used to determine the interdomain orientation in multidomain proteins. This is particularly important in the context of a calcium binding protein from Entamoeba histolytica (EhCaBP), which consists of two globular domains connected by a flexible linker region containing 8 residues. As a first step to obtain the interdomain orientation in EhCaBP, a suite of 2D and 3D heteronuclear experiments were recorded on EhCaBP by displacing calcium with Ce31, Ho31, Er31, Tm31, Dy31, and Yb31 ions in separate experiments, and the PCS of 1HN and 15N spins were measured. Such data have been used in the refinement of the individual domain structures of the protein in parallel with the calculation of the respective magnetic anisotropy tensorial values, which differ substantially (2.1­2.8 times) from what is found in other Ca21 binding loops. This study provides a structural basis for such variations in the magnetic anisotropy tensorial values. C Proteins 2006;65:656­669. V 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

and function as signal transducers or modulators. The trivalent lanthanides (Ln3þ), owing to their similar ionic ° radii (0.94­1.10 A) and coordination number as those of 2þ ° Ca (whose ionic radius is 1.04 A),9­11 are effective in displacing Ca2þ from their respective binding sites in CaBPs,12,13 and produce pseudocontact shifts (PCSs).14,15 PCSs arise due to hyperfine dipolar interactions between the magnetic dipole moment of the unpaired electron in the paramagnetic Ln3þ and the nuclear magnetic dipole moment of various NMR active nuclei, such as 1HN, 13C, and 15N present in a biomolecule under study.16 The PCSs are metal centric and dipolar in nature with 1/r3 dependence, where r is the distance between the Ln3þ and the NMR active nucleus affected by the paramagnetic ion.17­19 By virtue of this distance information embedded in them, PCS have been used as additional constraints in structure calculations and refinements of various metallo-proteins.19,15,20,21 Compared with the NOE constraints, which has 1/r6 dependence, PCSs have longer range because of which they have the additional advantage of constraining ° distances beyond 6 A. In the case of Ln3þ, the unpaired electron(s) in 4f orbital is (are) highly localized hence the hyperfine interactions are mainly pseudocontact in nature.16 Since such PCS interactions are always associated with metals having unpaired electrons, they are also accompanied with magnetic susceptibility anisotropy in the environment. The components of the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy tensor contribute to the magnitude and range of PCS interactions.14,17,18 To characterize the various aspects associated with PCS interactions in proteins, a detailed study of magnetic anisotropy tensorial values becomes a matter of utmost importance.

DIFFERENTIAL MAGNETIC ANISOTROPIC TENSORIAL VALUES IN CaBPs

we have undertaken selective displacement of Ca2þ by Ln3þ in a calcium binding protein from Entamoeba histolytica (EhCaBP). EhCaBP is a 134 amino acid residue long two-domain protein. It is a signal-transduction protein believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of amoebasis caused by protozoan.22­24 It has four canonical EF-hand calcium binding sites, two in each domain. The N- and Cterminal domains are separated by a flexible linker region of eight amino acid residues.5 Ln3þ displaces the four Ca2þ present in EhCaBP sequentially, first from the 3rd site followed by the 2nd, the 1st, and the 4th sites.10,11 During the displacement reaction, a large number of PCSs were assigned for both the domains at two Ln3þ:protein ratios of 1:1 and 1.7:1. Such PCSs were then used in the refinement of the individual structures of the respective domains, and in the calculation of the associated tensorial values of magnetic susceptibility anisotropies. The observed tensorial values vary significantly compared with those observed in other EF-hand CaBPs. In this article, we provide a structural basis for the origin of such differential MSA tensorial values and for the first time correlate the conformation of various metal (Ca2þ) binding loops with the magnitudes of the observed PCSs. This study provides a deeper understanding of the origin of PCS interactions in metalloproteins. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Preparation The protocols described earlier10,11,25 were used for the overexpression and purification of two samples of EhCaBP; (i) uniformly 15N-labeled (u-15N) EhCaBP and (ii) Arg, Ile, Leu, Lys, and Phe [RILKF] residues unlabeled and the rest of the amino acid residues uniformly 15 N labeled EhCaBP. The protein solutions were concentrated using an Amicon centricon unit equipped with a 3 kDa cutoff membrane. The protein concentrations were estimated using its absorbance at 280 nm (e ¼ 5120 MÀ1 cmÀ1) on a Varian Cary 50 scan spectrophotometer. NMR experiments were performed with 0.6 mL of $1 mM protein samples (pH 6.0) in a mixed solvent of 90% of H2O and 10% 2H2O. NMR Experiments NMR experiments were recorded on Varian Unity 600 MHz (NFMR, Mumbai) and Bruker Avance 700 MHz NMR spectrometers (CERM, Florence), both equipped with pulsed field gradient units and triple resonance probes with actively shielded Z-gradients. Sensitivity enhanced [15NÀ 1H]-HSQC26 spectra using pulsed field À gradients for coherence selection were recorded for various samples with Ln3þ doped at various metal to protein ratios ranging from 0:1 to 2:1. Data transformation and processing were done on a Graphic workstation (R10000 based Indigo II Solid Impact Graphics) using the Felix 2000 software (MSI). The 1HN and 15N chemical shifts published earlier25 were used to assign individual crosspeaks in the [15NÀ 1H]-HSQC spectrum of (Ca2þ)4À EhCaBP.

Titration of (Ca2þ)4-EhCaBP With Ln3þ Ions The displacement of Ca2þ in the EhCaBP with Ce3þ, Tm3þ, Dy3þ, Yb3þ, Ho3þ, and Er3þ was achieved by adding small aliquots from a 20 mM stock solution of LnCl3 to the protein solution. The [15NÀ 1H]-HSQC spectra were À recorded on (u-15N) EhCaBP samples for all the six types of Ln3þ in the metal: protein ratios ranging from 0:1 to 1:1 in steps of 0.1:1. During this phase, displacement of Ca2þ from 3rd site in C-terminal domain is initiated.10,11 The ensemble around the metal:protein ratio 1:1 essentially consisted of 62­70% uni-substituted Ln3þ species [Ca2þ] [Ca2þ][Ln3þ][Ca2þ]-EhCaBP (representing the PCS peaks) and 25­26% [Ca2þ]4-EhCaBP (representing the original diamagnetic peaks).10 The population of higher Ln3þ bound species such as [Ca2þ][Ln3þ][Ln3þ][Ca2þ]-EhCaBP (4­6%), [Ln3þ][Ln3þ][Ln3þ][Ca2þ]-EhCaBP ($2%) and [Ln3þ] [Ln3þ][Ln3þ][Ca2þ]-EhCaBP (<2%) are too small to produce any contaminating effect in the assignment of PCS shifts done in the above mentioned range. To study the effect of temperature on the individual PCSs and to resolve ambiguities in their measurements, particularly in both [Ho3þ]- and [Er3þ]-doped EhCaBP, the HSQC spectra were recorded on (u-15N)-EhCaBP samples at 25, 27, 30, 32, and 358C.15 For [Tm3þ]- and [Dy3þ]-doped EhCaBP, the HSQC at a metal: protein ratio of 1:1 were performed with both the EhCaBP samples mentioned above. During titration in the range of metal:protein ratio of 1:1­2:1, the displacement of Ca2þ from 2nd site in N-terminal domain is initiated.10 At the metal:protein ratio of 1.7:1, the ensemble contained $50% [Ca2þ][Ca2þ][Ln3þ][Ca2þ]EhCaBP and $42% [Ca2þ][Ln3þ][Ln3þ][Ca2þ]-EhCaBP, while other species like [Ln3þ][Ln3þ][Ln3þ][Ca2þ]-EhCaBP are present around 6­7%.10,11 In the case of Dy3þ, Tm3þ, Ho3þ, and Er3þ, many peaks specially those belonging to Nterminal domain were broadened around a metal:protein ratio of 1.7­1.8:1, making the PCS assignment impossible. However, in the case of Yb3þ, no broadening is seen, primarily because of the large PCS to Curie line broadening ratio of Yb3þ. Hence, the assignment of PCSs could be carried-out even at a higher metal:protein ratio of 1.7:1. The observed PCSs for Yb3þ due to the Ca2þ displacement from the 3rd site were only confined to the C-terminal domain10; hence, the PCSs in the N-terminal domain arising from the 2nd calcium binding site were assigned independently of its Cterminal counterpart. The possible contaminant, that is, species with 3rd, 2nd, and 1st sites filled that can affect the N-terminal peaks are present in small proportions ($6%) to produce any affect. Like Yb3þ, the observed PCSs in Ce3þ due to the Ca2þ displacement from the 3rd site were only confined to the C-terminal domain. However, though Ce3þ initially displaces Ca2þdisplacement was from 3rd site alone, but at higher metal:protein (M:P) ratio (>1.0), parallel displacement of Ca2þ from sites 1 and 2 was observed. This prevents unambiguous assignment of corresponding PCSs for N-terminal domain at higher metal:protein ratio (1.8 > metal:protein > 1.0). HSQC spectra showing PCSs of unisubstituted EhCaBP with Ho3þ and Er3þ at 358C are shown in Figure 1.

the principal axes coordinate system of the magnetic susceptibility tensor (see Fig. 2). This equation always assumes that the unpaired electron(s) is (are) localized on the paramagnetic center, that is, it is (they are) not involved in coordination, hence there is no contact shift contribution to the hyperfine shifts. For all Ln3þ, there is practically no delocalization of 4f orbital and this condition is usually safely assumed to be met. The above mentioned Eq. (1) clearly reflects the usefulness of PCS constraints in structure refinement of proteins.14,15 The program FANTASIAN27 essentially uses the above mentioned equation to calculate both the Dvax and Dvrh components of the magnetic susceptibility tensor from a preassigned set of PCSs and the spatial coordinates of the known molecular structure, which is for refinement. The information about both the components of the magnetic susceptibility tensor thus derived in turn helps in predicting the unassigned PCS values, if any. Equation (1) is used in structure calculation/refinement using PSEUDYANA28 wherein PCS values are used as additional structural constraints along with associated anisotropy values. PCS Assignments At 1:1 metal:protein ratio, the analysis of HSQC spectra of unisubstituted [Ln3þ][Ca2þ]3 EhCaBP samples was trivial with very few spectral overlaps (Fig. 1). In uncertain cases, selective unlabeling resulted in simplification of the HSQC spectra, and aided in unambiguous PCS assignments. Such assignments were verified using FANTASIAN, with the knowledge of the 3D structure of the C-terminal domain. Further, we could predict PCS values for the unassigned nuclei and crosscheck them in the corresponding HSQC spectra. No observed PCS was left unassigned. The PCSs thus assigned were only intradomain (within the C-terminal) in the case of [Yb3þ][Ca2þ]3-EhCaBP and [Ce3þ][Ca2þ]3-EhCaBP. In the

case of [Tm3þ][Ca2þ]3-EhCaBP, PCSs published earlier11 were used. In the case of Dy3þ, Ho3þ, and Er3þ samples, observation of both intra- and inter-domain PCSs complicated the spectral analysis, which could be resolved with the spectra recorded at different temperatures. The MOLMOL29 figure highlighting observed PCSs in Dy3þ and Er3þ unisubstituted species is shown in the Supplementary Figure S1. For residues in C-terminal domain both up and downfield shifted PCSs are observed for all the six Ln3þ. For Yb3þ and Er3þ, most of them are downfield shifted, the ratio of up- and down-field shifted peak is around 30:70 (Supplementary Table S1­S7,). For Tm3þ almost 65% of the peaks are down-filed shifted (Supplementary Table S1­S7). For Dy3þ 70% of the peaks are up-field shifted. In the case of Ho3þ, the ratio of up- and down-field shifted PCSs is around 60:40. As mentioned earlier, at a metal:protein ratio of 1.7:1 only the [Yb3þ]2[Ca2þ]2-EhCaBP spectrum was amenable for the measurement of domain independent PCS values. In this case, we did not observe any inter-domain PCSs. Interestingly, PCSs in the N-terminal domain due to Yb3þ in the 2nd site of EhCaBP were observed to be larger than the corresponding PCSs in the C-terminal domain due to Yb3þ in the 3rd site of EhCaBP (Supplementary Fig. S2). This observation is indicative of the fact that the tensorial values in C-terminal domain are smaller than its N-terminal counterpart, discussed later. PCS assignments thus obtained are given in Supplementary Tables S1­S7. Calculation of Tensorial Parameters and Structure Refinement For the evaluation of tensorial parameters, we have undertaken the refinement of C- and N-terminal domains by using the information about the assigned PCSs. A total of 438 and 70 PCSs along with 634 and 645 NOE constraints were put together in PSEUDYANA calculations for both C- and N-terminal domains, respectively. The initial tensorial parameters incorporated in PSEUDODYANA calculation were obtained from FANTASIAN calculation using the unrefined structure with only NOE constraints (PDB ID:1JFK). In PSEUDODYANA calculations, an ensemble of 200 random structures were generated, which were annealed in 40,000 torsion angle steps (TAD) steps. The default tolerance for PCS shifts was kept at 0.05 ppm. To make our calculations unambiguous, we undertook large number of parallel sets of calculation in which the initial tensorial values were varied in a wide-range. The range in which the variation occurred was around three times higher and lower than that of the initial tensorial parameters obtained by FANTASIAN. Among these parallel calculations, the optimal converged set having the lowest target function is taken for analysis. For both C and N-terminal domain, a final set of 16 structures from the converged set is used in the calculation of tensorial parameters. In particular, we selected all the structure whose tar-

RESULTS Calculation of Tensorial Parameters in C and N-Terminal Domain The magnetic susceptibility tensorial parameters were obtained using FANTASIAN. The refined set of family of 16 structures was taken for this purpose. The values were reported in Table II. Among the equivalent solutions generated by FANTASIAN through cyclic permutations of the three axes, a solution was chosen such that the DXax and DXrh values for Tm3þ, Er3þ, and Yb3þ are negative while those of Ho3þ, Dy3þ, and Ce3þ are positive (Fig. 4). With the present choice, the z-axes of the tensors for most of the Ln3þ (except Dy3þ and Ce3þ) are coincident with the helical axes of the E-helix (71S-84). The x and y axes point to the intervening loop joining the two EF hands present in the C-terminal domain. Further, we checked the agreement between the PCS values calculated over the final family of 16 structures for the C-terminal domain and the experimental ones, and the quality factor was found to be $10% for all the Ln3þ (Fig. 5). The calculation of tensorial values for the N-terminal domain is accomplished in the same way as its C-terminal counterpart. The refined set of family of 16 structures of N-terminal domain is taken for this purpose. The calculated tensorial parameters are given in Table III and the quality factor is found to be 12% (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Comparison of PCS Shifts Between C-Terminal Domains of EhCaBP With Other CaBPs The strength of anisotropy dictates the magnitude of PCSs in any system. In this aspect, we compared the magnitude of PCSs in C-terminal domain of EhCaBP with respect to the other EF hand CaBPs like D9K,15 calmodulin32 N60D (CaM), and parvalbumin.33 Figure 6 represents a MOLMOL figure showing magnitudes of PCSs in the protein frame. The red spheres are the negative PCSs and the green spheres are the positive PCSs. The radius of each sphere is proportional to the magnitude of the observed PCSs. It is clear from the figure that for both Tm3þ and Dy3þ the magnitude of shifts observed for D9K are much higher than those observed for C-terminal domain of EhCaBP. Further the histogram plot representing PCSs for Yb3þ in D9K and C-terminal domain of EhCaBP (Supplementary Fig. S4) shows PCSs of much higher magnitude in D9K when compared with that of C-terminal domain of EhCaBP. On comparing the PCSs for Dy3þ substituted parvalbumin33 and Tm3þ substituted CaM32 with that of the Tm3þ and Dy3þ substituted C-terminal domain of EhCaBP, we found that PCSs in both parvalbumin and CaM are of much higher magnitude than those observed in C-terminal domain in EhCaBP (see Fig. 7). The histogram plot (Supplementary Fig. S5) comparing the PCSs in Dy3þ substituted parvalbumin and C-terminal domain of EhCaBP also depicts the same conclusion. The lower magnitude of PCSs in C-terminal domain of EhCaBP is indicative of smaller magnitudes of anisotropic tensorial values for the 3rd site of EhCaBP compared with the other calcium binding loops.

ture, B0 the magnetic field strength, k the Boltzmann constant, and l0 the induction constant. For amide protons, the RACS correction is negligible since, the CSA of 1 N H (in ppm) is much smaller.30,31 Therefore, 1H remains the most suitable spin for the determination of Dv tensor parameters from PCS data. However, CSA of 15 N are higher than 1HN.31 Recently, an interesting work by John et al.30 reported RACS of the order of 0.15 ppm for 15N spins in a protein­protein complex. In light of this, we attempted to calculate RACS contribution to the observed 15N PCS, following the method of John et al.30 In first step, the structure refinement and calculation of Dv was performed by using 1HN PCS shift. The RACS contribution of 15N spins from the above equation was then calculated using these Dv values. The structure taken in such calculations is the lowest energy minimized structure from the final converged family, refined by only 1HN PCS shift. The RACS thus obtained for both the N- and C-terminal domains are given in the supplementary table (Supplementary Table S9). The values of RACS evaluated here are small; all of them lie with in the tolerance limit of 0.05 ppm used in the PSEUDODYANA calculations. No observable changes were noticed in structure refinement and optimal tensorial parameters, with and without RACS.

DISCUSSION The calculated Dvax and Dvrh values for both N- and C-terminal domains of EhCaBP are given in Tables II and III. In the case of the C-terminal domain, we could evaluate both the tensorial values for all the six Ln3þ species (Yb3þ, Dy3þ, Tm3þ, Er3þ, Ho3þ, and Ce3þ). In

the case of the N-terminal domain, however, we could evaluate the tensorial values only in the case of Yb3þ. The Dvax and Dvrh values thus obtained were first compared with those reported earlier in the case of other EF-hand protein, calbindin D9K.15 As evident from Table II, both Dvax and Dvrh values for the 2nd site belonging to the N-terminal domain of EhCaBP are similar to those reported earlier for calbindin D9K within the experimental error. On the other hand, the Dvax and Dvrh values for the 3rd site belonging to the C-terminal domain of EhCaBP with various Ln3þ surprisingly show large differences with respect to calbindin D9K. In particular, the value of Dvaxial for [Ca2þ][Ca2þ][Ln3þ] [Ca2þ]EhCaBP is found to be 2.1­2.8 times lower than that of calbindin D9K [Table IV]. The comparison of Dvrhombic values also shows a similar trend. Further, the comparison of Dvax and Dvrh values for the 3rd site with those of parvalbumin and CaM also showed lowering of anisotropic tensorial values (Table V). To provide a structural basis for such a discrepancy in the Dvax and Dvrh values, we looked at their origins following the Bleaney's theory,15,34 which is briefly recalled in the following paragraph. In 1972, Bleaney34 developed a theory to ascertain the origin of magnetic susceptibility tensorial parameters. The Dvax and Dvrh values as described earlier in Eq. (1) can be also written in the following form: Dvax / CJ A0 hr2 i and 2 Dvrh / CJ A2 hr2 i 2

CJ's are numerical coefficients, which are calculated for the individual Ln3þ by assuming that the ligand field splitting of the ground-state J multiplet is negligible compared with the Boltzmann energy kT. These coefficients are dependent only on the nature of the Ln3þ ion, and have no bearing on the metal binding loop. hr2i is the expectation value of r2 for the 4f-orbital. The 4f orbital of Ln3þ is highly constricted and it does

not take part in coordination. The value of hr2i for 4f orbital theoretically calculated for free Ln3þ and those involved in co-ordination differ by only 10%.35 Hence, the crystal field parameters or more precisely the crystal field coefficients correlate the co-ordination environment in which Ln3þ resides with the magnitude of anisotropic tensorial values.

The blue sphere indicates the Ln3þ.

domain occurs in the case of all Ln3þ reported here. Hence, it is the structure of the binding loop that leads to the variation of anisotropies by affecting the crystal field coefficients. Before discussing further, we discuss the conformation of the Ca2þ-binding loop in EF-hand Ca2þ-binding proteins. The Ca2þ-binding loop in these proteins consists of a contiguous 12-residues flanked by two a-helices, forming the so-called ``EF-hand motif''.8,36 Within the Ca2þbinding loop, residues that are involved in coordination with the metal ion are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12, forming a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry.8 In the following scheme, highly conserved residues are shown and ÆX, ÆY, ÆZ refer to the vertices of the pentagonal bi-pyramid: 1 D X 2 3 4 Á D=N Á Y 5 D=N Z 6 G 7 Á ÀX 8 Á 9 10 Á Á ÀY 11 Á 12 E ÀZ

The residues at positions 1, 3, 5, and 12 coordinate directly to Ca2þ via their side-chain carboxylate oxygen.8,37 The residue at position 7 coordinates Ca2þ via its backbone carbonyl group, while the residue at position 9 coordinates

Ca2þ indirectly through an intervening water molecule.8 In Ca2þ-binding loops, the residues at positions 1, 3, and 5 are involved in monodentate coordination to the metal ion, while the Glu residue at position 12 is involved in a bidentate coordination. As reported earlier, Ca2þ displacement by Ln3þ results in negligible structural perturbations in the metal binding loop11 and hence, the loop structure is essentially assumed to be unaltered. The structure refinement of C- and N-terminal domains of EhCaBP by PSEUDYANA reveals that the 3rd Ca2þ-binding loop in EhCaBP has more open loop conformation than the 2nd Ca2þ-binding site of EhCaBP, calbindin D9K (PDB ID:1SKM), CaM (PDB ID:1SW8) and parvalbumin (PDB ID:1RJV) (see Fig. 8).5 Such a divergence of the 3rd Ca2þ-binding loop of EhCaBP was earlier attributed to the presence of a Tyr residue instead of a highly conserved Phe5 at position À4 with respect to the binding loop. In a given domain containing a pair of EF-hands, Phe at À4 position with respect to the first EF-hand loop (F[-4]) interacts with another conserved Phe at position 13 of the second EF-hand loop (F[13]), such that their respective aromatic rings are oriented perpendicular to each other.38 Such an orientation

The anisotropies for CaM were calculated by FANTASIAN, using structure of N-terminal CaM N60D (PDB CODE 1SW8). Among three equivalent solutions generated by FANTASIAN by cyclic permutations of axes, the solution reported here are chosen as such that axial and rhombic anisotropies are both negative for comparison of the two set of tensorial values between EhCaBP and CaM.

° results in a Ca­Ca distance of $7­8 A.38 However, in the C-terminal domain of EhCaBP, the aromatic rings of Tyr 81 and Phe 129 are in a parallel orientation with respect to each other resulting in their Ca­Ca distance of the ° order of 10.5 A5 and resulting in relatively more open loop conformation for the 3rd Ca2þ binding site. As discussed above, Bleaney's theory correlates the conformation of the metal binding loop with the molecular magnetic anisotropy but the true nature of such a correlation is difficult to quantify with NMR structures of complex biomolecules like proteins in solution. However, to provide an insight into to the observed anomaly in the Dvax and Dvrh values, we analyzed metal­ligand distances in Ca2þ binding loops. For accurate estimate of the metal­ligand distances, the position of Ln3þ was

correctly fixed in the molecular frame. In this endeavor, we allowed the metal ion to roam freely in the molecular frame during PSEUDODYANA calculations. At the end of such calculations, the metal ion is found rigidly fixed in its binding site. This is primarily dictated by the metal centric property of PCS constraints. To check the consistency of such calculations, we repeated the calculations constraining more rigidly the distances between the metal ion and the coordinating residues belonging to the III rd Ca2þ-binding loop. Calculations performed setting tighter metal­ligand restraints of the order of 2.5­ ° 3 A resulted in serious violations, especially at position 3 of the 3rd binding loop. Conversely, when the metal­ ligand constraints were set loose, with an upper bound ° up to 8­10 A, no violations were seen and the 3D strucDOI 10.1002/prot

ture converged, setting aside doubts in the possibility of any calculation artifacts. The metal­ligand distances were calculated for all the 16 minimum target function conformers. The differences in such metal­ligand distances within the 3rd and the 2nd (3rd­2nd) binding loops are shown as histograms in Figure 9 for all the set of conformers both in the C- and the N-terminal domains of EhCaBP. It is evident from Figure 9 that the metal­ligand distances in the 3rd Ca2þ-binding loop, particularly at positions 1, 3, 5, and 7, show higher values compared with the same distances in the 2nd Ca2þ binding loop of EhCaBP. Further, comparison of the average metal­ligand distances in the 3rd site of EhCaBP with the corresponding distances in calbindin D9K(PDB ID: 1KSM and 4CIB), CaM(PDB ID:1SW8), and parvalbumin (PDB ID: 1RJV, 1TTB, 3PAT and 4PCV) reveals that at least 4 to 5 distances involving the oxygen ligand at positions 3, 5, 7, 1 and/or one of the two at position 12 are larger for the 3rd site of EhCaBP compared with those seen in CaBPs mentioned above (Table VI). In particular, it is worth to notice that the average metal­ligand distance at position 3 in the third Ca2þ-binding loop of EhCaBP is the larg° est ($3.8 A). This metal­ligand distance is found to be ° greater than 3.4 A in all the conformers, and may be too large for coordination, since a typical (Ln3þ/Ca2þ)-ligand coordination distance has its maximum limit around ° 3.0­3.2 A. Hence, it can be speculated that the ligand at position 3 of the third Ca2þ binding loop is either not coordinating at all with Ln3þ or may be it is ``weakly'' coordinating. This observation prompted us to look at the individual chemical shifts of Hb2/Hb3 protons, which are very sensitive to Ca2þ coordination.39 We found earlier that in the Ca2þ-bound state of EhCaBP one of the Hb2/Hb3 spins of D[1] (i.e. the Asp residue at position 1 of the Ca2þ-binding loop) exhibits up-field shifts as large as 1­1.2 ppm with respect to the random coil values.39 Another interesting and generalized observation shows that the Hb2/Hb3 spins are always nondegenerate for all the Asp and Asn residues, which are involved in direct monodentate coordination with Ca2þ through one of their side chain oxygen atoms, namely for residues at positions 1, 3, and 5 of the binding loop (Supplementary Table S8). This feature is common to almost all the EFhand CaBPs characterized by NMR so far (Supplementary Table S8). Indeed, the only exception is the Asp residue (Asp 87) at position 3 in the 3rd binding loop of EhCaBP, which exhibits degenerate chemical shift of 3.1 ppm for both Hb2 and Hb3, which is unusual for a residue that is supposed to be involved in Ca2þ coordination. Therefore, such observation suggests that the side chain of Asp 87 (D[3]) may be involved in an internal rotation along the Ca­Cb bond, leading to similar magnetic environments for both Hb2 and Hb3 spins. This observation may be a basis to rule out the possibility of the involvement of Asp 87 in metal coordination. As stated earlier, the magnitude of anisotropy is related with the structure through crystal field coefficients. Earlier works in crystal field coefficients reveals that they

At position 9, the metal is co-ordinated with backbone carbonyl oxygen via an intervening water molecule. In PSEUDYANA calculations such water molecule cannot be incorporated. However, if we measure the direct distance of carbonyl oxygen for ° ° ° residue at position 9 with respect to metal ion from NMR, it was found to be 6.49 A for D9K, 6.28 A for CaM, 6.21 A for para° valbumin, and 6.69 A for 3rd site of EhCaBP. Such observation may be indicative of slight increase of co-ordination length of ° ° 3rd site of EhCaBP compared, with the rest. X-ray crystal structure showed such distance to be 2.50 A for D9K, 2.32A for ° CaM, 2.30 A for paravalhumin. Holo-EhCaBP cannot be crystallized hence direct measurement of such bond length cludes us. However, taking average hydrogen bond length between intervening water and carbonyl oxygen from X-ray structures of all ° calcium binding loops, the metal­ligand distance for position 9 of 3rd site of EhCaBP was found to be 2.75 A, higher indeed.

are essentially characterized by three major contributions.35 They are ``net'' contribution, the ``overlap contribution'', and the ``lattice contribution''. The ``net'' contribution is dependent on the structure of valence electronic shell. Owing to the same valence electronic structure observed in most of the Ln3þ, the ``net'' contribution is fixed for all of them and it is independent of their coordination environment. The ``overlap contribution'' is due to the orbitals of the coordinating ligands overlapping with the valence electronic shell of Ln3þ. Closer are the ligand atoms from the central metal ion greater is the overlap between their orbitals hence higher is the ``overlap contribution''. Thus increase of metal­ligand distance in 3rd binding loop is expected to decrease the ``overlap'' contribution to the crystal field, hence lowering its anisotropic tensorial values compared to other CaBPs. The ``lattice'' contributions are basically due to electrostatic interactions between all atoms/ions in the lattice (in the present case, the protein) and the metal ion. Since the coordinating ions are closer to Ln3þ, their contribution is obviously larger than the rest. The ``lattice'' contribution shows RÀ3 dependence, where R is the metal­ligand distance. The increase in metal­ligand distance due to the open conformation of the 3rd Ca2þ-binding loop in EhCaBP is also expected to lead to a relative decrease in the ``lattice'' contributions as well. To have further insight into the observed anomaly in the Dvax and Dvrh values, we correlated the Dvax values obtained for the different lanthanides in the 3rd binding site in EhCaBP to the value previously estimated for Calbindin D9K (see Fig. 10). In the past, the experimental anisotropy values of Calbindin D9K were found to match exactly with the theoretically calculated values taking crystal field parameters as 172 cmÀ1.15 Likewise, the slope of the linear fit obtained through correlating the anisotropy values of the 3rd binding site of EhCaBP and that of Calbindin D9K in principle provides us with the ratio of their crystal field parameters. In such a correlation, the slope turned out to be around 2.60 and the regression coefficient r2 ¼ 0.85 (see Fig. 10). Taking the

value of CFP for Calbindin D9K as 172 cmÀ1,15 we could obtain the CFP for the EhCaBP 3rd binding site as 66 cmÀ1, which indeed reflects a lowering of crystal field effects as discussed earlier. Hence, apart from the type of Ln3þ another key factor in determining the magnitude of anisotropies appears to be the structure of the metal­binding loops under consideration. Therefore, at least a rough ``a priori'' hypothesis about the magnitude of anisotropies and PCSs originating from a EF-hand Ca2þ-binding loop may be established by comparing its structure with that (those) for which PCSs have been already measured. A reasonably good starting structure of the loops, either from X-ray or from NOE constraints in NMR, is, however, important to enable such initial comparisons and predictions. In conclusion, the present study provides an insight into the origin of the Dvax and Dvrh values and its dependence on the topology of the metal binding loop. To refine the structure of proteins using Ln3þ, not only the choice of a specific Ln3þ is important but also an insight into the structural features of the binding environment is necessary. The conformation of the binding loop determines the magnitude of the Dvax and Dvrh values in the system, hence indirectly accounts for the range of PCS interactions. This study provides a firm theoretical footing for the better usage of PCS constraints in structure refinement and the study of domain orientation in a multidomain protein, which is currently underway in our laboratory.
