Structural basis for operator and antirepressor recognition by Myxococcus xanthus CarA repressor
Gloria Navarro-Avilés,1 María Angeles Jiménez,2* Mari Cruz Pérez-Marín,1 Carlos González,2 Manuel Rico,2 Francisco Jose Murillo,1 Montserrat Elías-Arnanz1 and S. Padmanabhan1,2* 1 Departamento de Genética y Microbiología, Facultad de Biología, Universidad de Murcia, Murcia 30071, Spain. 2 Instituto de Química-Física `Rocasolano'-CSIC, 119 Serrano, Madrid 28006, Spain. Summary Blue light induces carotenogenesis in Myxococcus xanthus. The carB operon encodes all but one of the structural genes involved, and its expression is regulated by the CarA-CarS repressor-antirepressor pair. In the dark, CarA-operator binding represses carB. CarS, produced on illumination, interacts physically with CarA to dismantle the CarA-operator complex and activate carB. Both operator and CarS bind to the autonomously folded N-terminal domain of CarA, CarA(Nter), which in excess represses carB. Here, we report the NMR structure of CarA(Nter), and map residues that interact with operator and CarS by NMR chemical shift perturbations, and in vivo and in vitro analyses of site-directed mutants. We show CarA(Nter) adopts the wingedhelix topology of MerR-family DNA-binding domains, and conserves the majority of the helix-turn-helix and wing contacts with DNA. Tellingly, helix a2 in CarA, a key element in operator DNA recognition, is also critical for interaction with CarS, implying that the CarA-CarS protein-protein and the CarA-operator protein­DNA interfaces overlap. Thus, binding of CarA to operator and to antirepressor are mutually exclusive, and CarA may discern structural features in the acidic CarS protein that resemble operator DNA. Repressor inactivation by occluding the DNAbinding region may be a recurrent mechanism of action for acidic antirepressors. Introduction Bacteria adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions by turning on or off the expression of specific sets of genes. One critical external stimulus, light, affects various metabolic, developmental and behavioural processes in bacteria as well as higher organisms. In several bacterial species light provokes the synthesis of carotenoids, which serve to quell photo-oxidative cellular damage caused by reactive singlet oxygen and other free radical species produced upon illumination (Armstrong, 1997). Carotenoids also play roles in light-harvesting, as redox intermediates and as precursors for molecules required in photoreception and hormonal action (Frank and Brudvig, 2004). An important model system for light-induced carotenogenesis is the Gram-negative bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, where genetic and molecular analyses reveal intricate genetic circuits comprising several novel factors and regulatory mechanisms for the photo-induction of enzymes responsible for carotenoid synthesis. All of the enzymes for carotenogenesis in M. xanthus are encoded by the carB operon, except for the unlinked crtI gene (Fontes et al., 1993; Botella et al., 1995). carB expression from its typical s70-type bacterial promoter, PB, requires RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing sA, the major vegetative sigma factor in M. xanthus, and its induction by light is intimately linked to the activity of the CarA repressor (Ruiz-Vázquez et al., 1993; Whitworth and Hodgson, 2001; Cervantes and Murillo et al., 2002; López-Rubio et al., 2002). In the dark, PB is switched off by CarA binding to its operator. The operator has a bipartite design with a high affinity site pI corresponding to a perfect interrupted palindrome located upstream of PB, and a low affinity site pII, a pI-like pseudopalindrome that straddles the -35 region of PB; thus, CarA binds cooperatively in a stepwise manner first to pI and then to pII to effectively impede promoter access to RNA polymerase and repress carB (López-Rubio et al., 2004). Lightinduced activation of carB essentially involves disrupting the CarA-operator complex. This is achieved by light triggering production of CarS, an antirepressor of CarA. CarS does not bind DNA but physically interacts with CarA to eliminate CarA-operator binding. CarS is expressed by the photo-inducible carQRS operon, which also produces CarQ, an extra-cytoplasmic function (ECF) s-factor, and its antisigma factor, CarR

Structural basis for CarA-binding to DNA and CarS 981 (McGowan et al., 1993). Expression of carQRS (and crtI) requires CarQ (Fontes et al., 1993; McGowan et al., 1993). CarQ, sequestered in the dark by membranebound CarR, is released when light inactivates CarR (Browning et al., 2003). The mechanism for this is unknown, but involves at least one constitutively produced protein, CarF (Fontes et al., 2003). However, the need for light and CarF can be bypassed by copper (Moraleda-Muñoz et al., 2005). Free CarQ then associates with RNA polymerase to transcribe carQRS. This also absolutely requires three other constitutively produced factors: CarD, the only known bacterial analogue of eukaryotic high mobility group A proteins (Nicolás et al., 1994; 1996; Padmanabhan et al., 2001; Cayuela et al., 2003); the histone-like IhfA (Moreno et al., 2001); and CarG, a novel zinc-bound transcriptional factor (PeñalverMellado et al., 2006). Repression of carB in the dark and its activation by light therefore reflect an antagonistic interplay between interactions of CarA with its operator or with CarS. We previously showed that both these binding modes of CarA map to its 78-residue N-terminal segment, which constitutes a stable, autonomously folding monomeric domain, CarA(Nter), that by itself can repress carB in vivo in a dosedependent manner (Pérez-Marín et al., 2004). A structural basis for the molecular mechanism underlying this competitive binding is provided in this study. We determined the three-dimensional NMR structure of CarA(Nter), and mapped out specific residues and structural elements which are crucial for recognizing operator and CarS, and so for function in vivo. CarA(Nter) adopts the winged-helix topology of MerR-family DNA-binding domains (DBD), consistent with predictions from sequence analysis. We further show that it retains many of the critical MerR-type DNA-binding contacts in its helix-turn-helix (HTH) and wing. We find a2 of the HTH motif to not only mediate specific recognition of operator DNA but also of the CarS antirepressor. This implies that binding of CarS and operator DNA to CarA are mutually exclusive. Occlusion of the DNA-binding region of the CarA repressor by the CarS antirepressor thus provides the mechanistic basis for this on-off switch that controls light induction of gene expression in M. xanthus. the ensemble of the final 20 NMR structures (Fig. 1A) calculated from 1072 NOE distance constraints and 126 dihedral angle constraints using restrained molecular dynamics with simulated annealing algorithms (Supplementary Fig. S1B lists the structural statistics). Pairwise root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) for the superposition of these structures are 1.7 0.4 Å and 2.6 0.4 Å, respectively, for backbone and heavy atoms. These reduce to 0.5 0.2 Å and 1.6 0.2 Å, respectively, when segments between residues 1­6 and 34­43 that are not well-defined by the NMR constraints are excluded in the superposition. Steady-state heteronuclear backbone {1H}15 N NOEs of less than 0.6 for residues in both these segments confirm these regions to be flexible with large amplitude motions on the subnanosecond timescale (Supplementary Fig. S1C). The four a-helices, a1, a2, a3 and a4, in CarA(Nter) span residues 5­12, 15­26, 44­59 and 65­73, respectively, and are present as two HTH segments separated by 17 residues. Residues 2­4 and 40­42 may form a small antiparallel b-sheet: the positive chemical shift changes relative to random coil values (Supplementary Fig. S1A) for most of the residues within these two short segments are consistent with extended b-conformations, and NOEs are observed between the R4 and Y42 side chains. The least solvent accessible residues are I8, A9, L19, W22, F28, P29, Y42, V50, V53, A54, A67 and I68, and their side chains contribute towards the formation of a compact hydrophobic core. The estimated changes in solvent-accessible non-polar and polar surface areas for native CarA(Nter) relative to its unfolded form modelled as an extended chain with b-conformation, are 5300 Å2 and 3300 Å2 respectively. These correlate with a heat capacity change for folding, DCp, of (1.19 0.24) caldeg-1 mol-1 (Myers et al., 1995), comparable to that estimated from denaturation data (Pérez-Marín et al., 2004). CarA(Nter) adopts the winged-helix topology of MerR family DBDs A DALI search of the structure database (Holm and Sander, 1993) revealed a high degree of structural similarity (z score > 7) between CarA(Nter) and the DBD of each of three MerR family transcription regulators, BmrR, MtaN and CueR, whose winged-helix topology consists of a four-helix bundle formed by two HTH segments and an antiparallel b-sheet made up of two or three short strands (Changela et al., 2003; Newberry and Brennan, 2004). The pairwise r.m.s.d. for an overlay of the CarA(Nter) backbone onto the DBD of BmrR, MtaN or CueR is 2.8, 2.3 or 2.4 Å, respectively, and 1.8 Å, 1.7 Å or 1.8 Å, respectively, when only regions with well-defined secondary structure are compared (Fig. 1B). The CarA(Nter) sequence is 11­23% identical

Results NMR structure of CarA(Nter) H and 15N NMR resonances in 15N-labelled native CarA(Nter), a monomer with high a-helical content (PérezMarín et al., 2004), were assigned using standard procedures. Short and medium range NOE and chemical shift data (Supplementary Fig. S1A) suggest four a-helical segments in CarA(Nter). These can be seen in

and 34­52% similar to these MerR-family DBDs (Fig. 1C). Most of the hydrophobic core residues are conserved. R40 in CarA(Nter) is absolutely conserved in MerR proteins, where it is a crucial DNA-contact residue and is almost always associated with a conserved E or D as a possible salt-bridge partner. The equivalent R39 in MtaN forms a buried salt-bridge with D23 to help position the third b-strand and the guanidinium group of R

for contacting the DNA backbone (Godsey et al., 2001; Newberry and Brennan, 2004); R43 in BmrR turns away from the carboxylate group of D26 to interact with the DNA backbone (Zheleznova-Heldwein and Brennan, 2001); and R37 and E21 in CueR can form a salt-bridge (Changela et al., 2003). In CarA(Nter), R40 has E23 as its possible partner, and both are solvent-exposed in the NMR structures.

Fig. 2. NMR analysis of CarA(Nter) interactions with DNA or CarS1. A superposition of 1H-15N HSQC spectra at 45°C of 100 mM 15 N-CarA(Nter) alone (red contours), or with a threefold excess of 24 bp DNA (green contours), or a twofold excess of H6-CarS1 (blue contours) is shown on the left. Solution conditions are described in the text. Cross-peak assignments in free 15N-CarA(Nter) are labelled. The backbone fold of CarA(Nter) on the right and the sequence at the bottom indicate residues whose 1H-15N HSQC cross-peaks were affected (shifted or disappeared) by DNA (green), H6-CarS1 (blue), or both (magenta). Residues unaffected are in black, while those undetected or which occur in regions of high spectral overlap are in grey. The secondary structural elements are labelled.

Operator and CarS contact regions of CarA(Nter) mapped by NMR CarA(Nter) residues proximal to DNA or CarS can be deduced from the shifts in 1H-15N HSQC cross-peaks on titrating 15N-CarA(Nter) with unlabelled DNA or CarS respectively. The 1H-15N signals disappeared when 15NCarA(Nter) was titrated with up to a threefold excess of a 24 bp DNA fragment corresponding to the high affinity CarA operator site, pI, and 3 flanking base pairs at 25°C/ pH 6.5­7.5/0­100 mM NaCl. Several, though not all, of these cross-peaks reappeared at 45°C in the presence of 50 mM each of Arg and Glu in the buffer for improved solubility (Golovanov et al., 2004). About 21 cross-peaks remained undetected at 45°C possibly due to very rapid exchange of the amide protons with solvent. CarA(Nter), whose temperature at the folding transition midpoint, Tm, is 76°C (Pérez-Marín et al., 2004) would be expected to be predominantly native at 45°C, as would the DNA used, with an estimated Tm of 66°C. The observed signal loss at 25°C and its partial recovery at 45°C can be attributed to

line-broadening effects resulting from exchange between free and bound forms of CarA(Nter) that is intermediate on the NMR timescale, and from the larger size of the complex. The gradual shifts in the 1H-15N HSQC peaks of 15 N-CarA(Nter) with stepwise temperature increments aided their reassignment at 45°C starting from their values at 25°C. Those 1H-15N cross-peaks that were detected and could be unambiguously identified as perturbed (shifted or gradually lost) during the titration with DNA are summarized in Fig. 2. Most of these map to a1, a2 and the loop between a2 and a3. On titrating 15N-CarA(Nter) with CarS the 1H-15N HSQC cross-peaks disappeared, as with DNA. However, higher temperature and optimized solution conditions did not lead to partial signal recovery in titrations with CarS, unlike with DNA. By contrast, these conditions could more successfully restore the partial recovery of the line-broadened 1H-15N HSQC cross-peaks when 15NCarA(Nter) was titrated with CarS1 rather than CarS. CarS1 is a truncated form of CarS that lacks the latter's 25 C-terminal residues and, like CarS, forms a 1:1 complex

984 G. Navarro-Avilés et al. with CarA(Nter) to eliminate its binding to DNA in vitro (Pérez-Marín et al., 2004). It is clear from Fig. 2 that the majority of the detected 1H-15N cross-peaks that were perturbed by CarS1 map to residues in helices a1, a2 and the loop between a2 and a3, just as was observed with DNA. In particular, almost all of those assigned in a2 as perturbed by DNA were also affected by CarS1. Thus, NMR chemical shift mapping suggest that DNA and CarS1 contact highly overlapping zones of CarA(Nter), and that a2 is a key structural element mediating such contacts. Effects of site-directed N-terminal mutations on CarA function in vivo Specific CarA N-terminal residues that interact with operator and/or CarS were independently probed by examining the effects in vivo and in vitro of site-directed mutants. CarA residues for mutation were chosen based on the sequence alignment and structural homology of its DBD to those of BmrR and MtaN, and the finding that residues contacting DNA are highly conserved in BmrR and MtaN even though their DNA sites are different (Newberry and Brennan, 2004). Such a choice would reveal the extent to which CarA conserves MerR-type DNA contacts. R4, I5, R6, R15, A17, T18, R20, A21, W22, N38, Y39, R40, Q58, S63 and V64 in CarA align with those contacting DNA in the BmrR and MtaN complexes (Fig. 1C). Each of these was mutated to A, except for I5, W22, Y39 and V64 (and residues 17 and 21, which are already A). All of the exceptions are non-polar residues which, being typically buried, tend to be crucial for protein stability (Sauer et al., 1996). R24, R25, R33 and R55, conserved in some MerR DBDs, were also probed by site-directed mutagenesis. A total of 13 residues were thus examined (Fig. 3A). Each carA mutant was introduced into M. xanthus (see Experimental procedures). Western blots of the corresponding whole cell extracts using antibodies against CarA confirmed all of the mutant proteins to be stable in vivo (not shown). A lack-of-function carA mutation can be inferred by the colour phenotype associated with carotenogenesis. Wild-type M. xanthus cells are yellow in the dark because CarA represses carB. They turn deep red in the light as carB is derepressed by CarS binding to CarA, and crtI is also photo-induced. A carA-deleted (carAD) strain is orange in the dark because there is no CarA to repress carB, and turns red in the light due to photo-induction of crtI. Likewise, strains expressing stable, single-site mutants of CarA defective in operatorbinding would not repress carB, and would be orange in the dark and red in the light. On the other hand, stable CarA mutants impaired in binding to CarS but not to operator would result in strains where carB is repressed but not photo-induced, and these would be yellow in the dark as well as in the light. However, strains with stable single-site CarA mutants defective in binding to operator as well as CarS would be phenotypically indistinguishable from those impaired only in operator-binding (i.e. orange in the dark and red in the light). Consequently, each CarA variant was independently assessed for interactions with CarS by yeast two-hybrid analysis. As Fig. 3A summarizes, of the 13 mutants analysed only those expressing CarA variants T18A, R55A, Q58A or S63A behaved like wild type. Those with CarA mutations R4A, R6A, R15A, R20A, R25A, R33A, N38A or R40A were orange in the dark and red in the light, indicating carB is not repressed, as in the carAD strain. Moreover, expression levels of a reporter PB­lacZ fusion in these mutant strains were comparable to those of the carAD strain, and significantly higher in the dark or light when compared with wild type (Fig. 3B). Thus, these stable variants must be impaired in operator-binding. On the other hand, the strain with the R24A variant was yellow both in the dark and light, suggesting that carB repression persists but its photo-induction is impaired. Consistent with this, the reporter PB­lacZ expression for the R24A strain was far lower than for carAD in the dark, and remained unchanged in the light. The somewhat higher lacZ activity in the dark for the R24A strain than for the wild type suggests that this variant may repress carB to a lower degree, but not to the extent as to produce a visibly orange colour in the dark. Yeast two-hybrid analysis confirmed the weaker interaction of the R24A variant with CarS, and further revealed that, among the others, only the R25A variant was also affected in interaction with CarS (Fig. 3C, left). Reporter lacZ expression levels (Fig. 3C, right) for these two variants were similar to one another and about half of those observed for the wild type or for representative variants affected only in operatorbinding (R20A and R40A). CarA residues critical for operator-binding thus lie in a1 (R4, R6), a2 (R15, R20, R25), and the segment between a2 and a3 (R33, N38, R40), while the two residues implicated in interactions with CarS (R24 and R25) map to a2. That all but one of these residues are R suggests charge effects may contribute significantly to the interactions with operator as well as with CarS. Although 1H-15N HSQC cross-peaks for T18 and R20 were perturbed on titrating with DNA or CarS1, the lack of any effect in vivo of the T18A mutation, and that of R20A only on carB repression suggests that modifying the side chains of these residues to that of A does not adversely affect interactions with DNA and/or CarS. Moreover, it may be noted that in BmrR and in some other MerR proteins the residue equivalent to T18 is an A (Fig. 1C; Newberry and Brennan, 2004). Overall, the mutational analyses show that CarA conserves several of the DNA contacts that characterize MerR-type winged-helix DBDs, and that these as well as

contacts to CarS map to zones inferred by NMR chemical shift perturbations. In particular, helix a2 in CarA contains residues crucial for binding to DNA as well as to CarS. Analysis of the binding of CarA N-terminal variants to operator DNA and CarS in vitro Representative CarA variants apparently affected in interactions with operator or CarS (R20A, R24A, R25A and R40A) were further examined for DNA and CarS-binding in vitro. In gel-shift assays (EMSA) two DNA probes were used (Fig. 4A). A 130 bp probe, CCR, contains both the high affinity pI site (-64 to -47, relative to the transcription

start site; Fig. 4A), and the lower affinity pII site (-26 to -40) of the bipartite CarA operator. The other probe, CCR64, lacks pII. Stepwise CarA-CCR binding is manifested by a lower retarded band appearing first for CarA-pI binding, and then an upper one for pII-binding with increasing CarA concentrations. CarS, when added, first disrupts the CarA-pII complex and then the CarA-pI complex. Only one retarded band is seen with CCR64, in accord with the pI site alone being present (López-Rubio et al., 2002; 2004). CarA(Nter) binds to CCR with the same specificity as CarA, albeit with a lower affinity (Pérez-Marín et al., 2004). Given that CarA(Nter) is both the operator and CarS-interacting domain, and that it is far

more soluble, easier to purify and more suitable for biophysical characterization than CarA, the effects of the single mutations were tested in vitro with this domain. A ladder-like pattern of bands appear progressively with increasing CarA(Nter) concentrations in EMSA with CCR as well as CCR64. Up to four retarded bands can be observed with CCR (lanes 2­5, Fig. 4B), the smearing out of the lowest mobility band at the highest CarA(Nter) concentration used possibly reflecting additional nonspecific binding and/or DNA binding cooperativity at these concentrations; on the other hand, two retarded bands are observed with CCR64 (lanes 2­7, Fig. 4C). This would be

consistent with stepwise binding to each half-site of pI and then pII. Faint retarded bands begin to appear for the R20A and R40A variants on binding to CCR (see lanes 6­9 and 18­21, Fig. 4B) or CCR64 (lanes 8­13 and 26­31, Fig. 4C) only at protein concentrations 800 nM. This is about 20-fold higher than required for comparable binding by CarA(Nter), indicating that these variants bind weakly to the operator DNA. Binding to CCR or to CCR64 begins to be observed at lower protein concentrations (200 nM) for the R25A variant (lanes 14­17, Fig. 4B; lanes 20­25, Fig. 4C), but still about four- to eightfold higher than required for the wild type.

Although binding of the R24A variant at the lower protein concentrations used resembled wild type, the lowest mobility complexes were not detected at the higher protein concentrations suggesting that complex formation with the operator is less stable for this mutant (lanes 10­13, Fig. 4B; lanes 14­19, Fig. 4C). This would be in accord with the somewhat higher carB expression observed in the dark for the strain bearing the R24A mutation noted earlier in Fig. 3B. We next examined how each of the above four purified CarA(Nter) variants interacts with CarS by HPLC in a Superdex200 analytical gel filtration column. Using this method we had previously demonstrated that CarA(Nter) forms a complex of 1:1 stoichiometry with CarS or CarS1, stable enough to be observed as a higher molecular weight species that elutes distinctly from the pure proteins (Pérez-Marín et al., 2004). Purified CarA(Nter), CarS and H6-CarS1 elute off an analytical Superdex-200 column as monomers with apparent molecular weights (Mr, in kDa) of 9.6, 15.5 and 15.1, respectively (calculated monomer values are, 9.5, 12.5 and 11.5 respectively), while Mr for the CarA(Nter)-CarS and CarA(Nter)-H6-CarS1 complexes are (30 2) and (27 1) respectively. Pure CarA(Nter) variants R20A, R24A, R25A and R40A also elute as monomers with Mr ~9.5 kDa (Fig. 5A, top panel). When mixed with equimolar or various-fold excess of CarS (middle panel) or H6-CarS1 (bottom panel) stable 1:1 complexes with Mr of (30 2) and (25 2) were clearly detected for the variants R20A and R40A, but not for R24A or R25A. These observations are thus consistent with conclusions from the two-hybrid analysis described earlier. A further confirmation in vitro was provided by EMSA analysis of the CCR64-binding of these variants (at concentrations sufficient to detect even the weak binding of R20A or R40A) in the presence of CarS. As seen in Fig. 5B, a twofold excess of CarS markedly decreased CCR64-binding by CarA(Nter) (compare lanes 2 and 3): free probe was not detected with CarS absent, and ~70% of the retarded DNA corresponds to the lower mobility complex; in contrast, only about 18% of this complex remains with CarS present, and > 40% of the probe is free. CarS completely eliminated the weak CCR64 binding by the R40A variant (compare lanes 8 and 9, Fig. 5B) or R20A (not shown). By contrast, in the presence of excess CarS, binding to CCR64 persisted for both the R24A and the R25A variants even though these variants bind to operator with lower affinities than CarA(Nter), and the decrease in the fraction of DNA-bound complexes on adding CarS was small or negligible (lanes 4 and 6 vs. lanes 5 and 7, respectively, in Fig. 5B).

988 G. Navarro-Avilés et al. The above in vitro results are therefore in overall agreement with inferences from the in vivo data, namely, that operator-binding is impaired significantly for R20A, R25A or R40A, and slightly for R24A, and that R24A or R25A affect union to CarS (or CarS1) as well. the local DNA axes are nearly perpendicular to each other. As with MtaN or BmrR, many DNA contacts of CarA(Nter) cluster in a2, besides a1 and the flexible `wing' of CarA(Nter) in the part that precedes a3. The MtaN/BmrR wing contacts minor groove bases as well as DNA backbone phosphate and sugar groups, and the apparently lower crystal thermal factors of this wing segment in DNA-bound MtaN relative to the free form suggests a decreased flexibility on DNA-binding. NMR studies showed that the wing was immobilized upon DNA-binding in the Mu repressor winged-helix DBD (Wojciak et al., 2001), but that it remained dynamic in the Genesis protein (Jin et al., 1999). Signal-broadening effects, however, precluded such NMR studies on the conformational behaviour of the CarA(Nter) wing upon binding DNA or CarS. A long helix, a5, that follows a4 of the MtaN, BmrR and CueR DBDs, forms an antiparallel coiled-coil to mediate dimerization, and positions the DBD on the DNA (Newberry and Brennan, 2004). Although secondary structure predictions do not indicate such a helix in CarA, it is known to dimerize via its C-terminal domain, CarA(Cter), and the cooperativity from CarA binding to operator as a preformed dimer rationalizes its considerably higher DNA-binding affinity over CarA(Nter) (López-Rubio et al., 2002; 2004; Pérez-Marín et al., 2004). Analogous to MerR C-terminal dimerization domains which typically bind specific ligands like a metal or drug (Brown et al., 2003), sequence analysis revealed that CarA(Cter) contains the signature sequence for binding vitamin B12 of the type found in methionine synthase (Cervantes and Murillo, 2002; Supplementary Fig. S2). B12-binding to CarA has been confirmed experimentally (Pérez-Marín et al., 2004), but its role on CarA activity, if any, is unknown and is currently being investigated. In a homology model of the B12-bound CarA(Cter) dimer, based on the structure of the methionine synthase B12-binding domain, the N-termini of the two CarA(Cter) units would lie within a distance comparable to that separating the C-termini of the two MtaN DBD modules in the complex with DNA. Including this homology modelled CarA(Cter) dimer in the model for the CarA(Nter)-DNA complex (Fig. 6A) would therefore position the two CarA(Nter) units appropriately for optimal operator recognition. High-resolution structures of CarA(Cter) or of whole CarA with DNA could validate this model, and also shed light on the role, if any, of B12 on CarA function. Implications for CarA-CarS recognition and the mechanism of antirepression Non-covalent union of the antirepressor to repressor (not DNA) is a frequently employed mechanism for antirepressor activity. Such a union can modify the conformation or oligomeric state of the repressor (Lewis et al., 1998; Masuda and Bauer, 2002), cause intracellular aggrega-

Discussion Structural model for CarA-binding to its operator CarA(Nter) adopts the winged-helix fold of the DBD of MerR-family proteins BmrR, MtaN and CueR, and it conserves the majority, though not all, of the specific DNAcontacts observed for BmrR and MtaN in their complexes with DNA. This is noteworthy given that the operator sequence and design for CarA are different from those for the MerR operators. Unlike with CarA, the MerR operators are not bipartite and lie within non-optimally spaced -35 and -10 promoter regions, and operator-bound MerR proteins can be modulated not only to repress transcription but also to activate it (Brown et al., 2003). BmrR and MtaN bind as homodimers to their dyad symmetry-related operator DNA, distorting it around the central base pairs by a near-identical 50° bend, and the structures of the complex reveal that each DNA half-site is bound to the DBD of a BmrR or MtaN monomeric unit (Newberry and Brennan, 2004). DNase I footprints for other MerR proteins also display intense hypersensitive bands, symptomatic of DNA distortion caused by a local bending towards the major groove and a widened and more DNase I-susceptible minor groove (Outten et al., 2000). Stepwise CarA(Nter)-binding to each operator DNA halfsite is consistent with its ladder-like EMSA pattern (Fig. 4B and C). Moreover, operator-binding of CarA as well as CarA(Nter) are also characterized by pronounced DNase I hypersensitive sites at the central dinucleotide of the pI operator site suggestive of DNA distortion centred at this site (López-Rubio et al., 2002; 2004; Pérez-Marín et al., 2004). Thus, DNA recognition by CarA(Nter) appears to follow similar structural guidelines as BmrR and MtaN. A structural model for the CarA(Nter)-DNA complex can therefore be proposed based on data from the present study and the reported structures for MtaNDNA and BmrR-DNA complexes. In the model (Fig. 6A), the average NMR structure of free CarA(Nter) was superimposed onto each DBD of the MtaN-DNA complex, and the DNA sequence in the complex was replaced by the CarA operator pI site. The ~50° DNA bend between the two dyad symmetry-related DNA half-sites was retained, and the relative positions of the two CarA(Nter) molecules, with no dimer contacts between them, were fixed to those for the MtaN DBD in its DNA complex. a2, as the DNA recognition helix, docks onto the major groove of each pI half-site such that the a2 and

The two DNA strands are depicted in green and dark blue and are bent by 47° in the centre. Each CarA(Nter) monomer is shown in ribbon representation in light blue with the DNA recognition helix (a2) in red. The homology modelled CarA(Cter) is in grey with bound vitamin B12 in black. The views are perpendicular (left) and parallel (right) to the DNA axis, related by a 90° rotation about the horizontal. B. Model for CarA-mediated repression in the dark and antirepression by CarS in the light. In the dark, dimeric CarA (green) binds to its bipartite operator (pI-pII) via its N-terminal domain (helix a2 in blue) to deny promoter access to RNA polymerase (red) and so repress carB. Binding of CarA (via a2) to CarS (orange) produced in the light, disrupts the CarA-complex allowing RNA polymerase to initiate carB transcription. C. CarA(Nter) surface coloured according to electrostatic potential (-4 kT to 5 kT; k is the Boltzman constant and T the absolute temperature) with regions of positive potential blue and negative potential red, the colour intensity scaling with potential. On the left is shown the positively charged CarA(Nter) surface that would interact with the pI half-site of operator DNA (modelled in red). R24 important for interaction with CarS is at the bottom left and would be proximal to the expected distortion about the central base pair of pI. The right view is a 180° rotation of that on the left.

990 G. Navarro-Avilés et al. tion and relocalization of the repressor (Davis et al., 2002) or promote its degradation (Luo et al., 2001). The present study provides experimental evidence for yet another mechanism, that of occluding the DNA-binding region of the repressor by the antirepressor. Detailed molecular descriptions for this obvious and frequently proposed mechanism for repressor-antirepressor systems are, to our knowledge, surprisingly few. Our data reveal that the CarA(Nter) helix a2, a key element in operator DNA recognition, is also critical for interaction with CarS. This implies that the CarA-CarS protein-protein and the CarAoperator protein­DNA interfaces overlap, so that binding of one to CarA would exclude the other. That a2 contains sequence-structure specificity determinants sufficient for binding to CarS is further supported by the latter's ability to also interact with the N-terminal region of Orf11 (our unpublished data), a CarA-like protein in M. xanthus, where the a2 segment is highly conserved (Cervantes and Murillo, 2002; Supplementary Fig. S2). The present study thus yields a structural-mechanistic model for the on-off control of light-induced gene expression of carB by CarA and CarS. As depicted in Fig. 6B, the model shows how dimeric CarA binds, via the N-terminal domain, to its bipartite operator in a cooperative manner. This impedes promoter access to RNA polymerase to enforce carB repression in the dark. Derepression in the light occurs by the sequestering of CarA through its physical union with CarS produced under these conditions. The picture that emerges is that binding of CarS and operator DNA to CarA are mutually exclusive, and involve a2 as a common overlapping element. a2 and a1 constitute the most positively charged portion of the highly basic CarA(Nter) (theoretical pI = 10.7), and form a continuous positively charged ridge in the tertiary structure that would be optimal for binding to the negatively charged DNA (Fig. 6C). This same region encompassing a2 also interacts with CarS and CarS1. Thus, structural landmarks present in operator DNA may also occur in CarS and CarS1. In other words, the CarA-binding region of CarS might resemble operator DNA features in shape and electrostatic complementarity. Both CarA residues identified as crucial for binding CarS are R, indicating that charge effects could contribute significantly to CarA-CarS complex formation, just as for CarA-operator DNA. Moreover, like reported DNA mimics that function in diverse DNA transactions and are typically acidic proteins, CarS and CarS1 are both negatively charged (theoretical pI of 4.8 and 4.1 respectively). The structures of known DNA mimics, where available, reveal that they imitate DNA by enlisting a-helical elements, as in the eukaryotic transcription factor TAFII230 domain (pI = 3.8) that binds the TATA box-binding protein (Liu et al., 1998a), and in the phage T7 Ocr (pI = 3.9) that inhibits type I restriction enzymes (Walkinshaw et al., 2002); b-sheet structures, as in phage PBS1 Ugi (pI = 4.2) that blocks the DNA repair enzyme uracil-DNA glycosylase (Mol et al., 1995); or a righthanded quadrilateral b-helix, as in M. tuberculosis MfpA (pI = 5.5) that counteracts DNA gyrase (Hegde et al., 2005). Our ongoing determination of the structure of CarS (which has no known sequence homologues), and its complex with CarA(Nter) would answer if and how it may resemble CarA operator DNA. Non-covalent binding to their cognate repressor is the observed or proposed mechanism of action for various bacteriophage antirepressors like P22 Ant, P1 Coi, 186 Tum, P4 E and RS1 RstC (Susskind and Botstein, 1978; Heinzel et al., 1992; Liu et al., 1998b; Shearwin et al., 1998; Davis et al., 2002). Whether these interact with the DNA-binding region of their cognate repressor has not, to our knowledge, been determined, nor has any structural data for how they interact been reported. Like CarS, Coi, Tum and RstC are acidic proteins (pI of 4.1, 5.0 and 4.5 respectively). Moreover, Tum shares a 31% sequence identity to DinI, a DNA mimic that negatively regulates the Escherichia coli SOS response, raising the possibility that DNA mimicry may underlie Tum activity (Voloshin et al., 2001). Thus, at least for some of these bacteriophage antirepressor systems, occlusion of the DNA-binding site of the repressor via physical interaction with a presumably DNA-like surface on the antirepressor may provide, as with the CarA-CarS pair, the molecular basis for repressor inactivation.

Experimental procedures Strains and media
Myxococcus xanthus strains used in this study are DK1050 (the wild-type strain ­ Ruiz-Vázquez and Murillo, 1984) and its derivative, MR844, which bears a non-polar carA deletion (Cervantes and Murillo, 2002). DK1050-derived M. xanthus strains which bear carA alleles with mutations of specific residues to Ala were constructed as described below. The casitone-Tris (CTT) rich medium was used to grow M. xanthus cells (Bretscher and Kaiser, 1978). E. coli strain DH5a was used for plasmid constructions, and BL21(DE3) (pLysS) for protein overexpression. Cell growth was carried out in Luria broth or in a modified M9 minimal medium with 15 NH4Cl and glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources for expressing uniformly 15N-labelled protein (Sambrook and Russell, 2001).

Site-directed mutagenesis, plasmid and strain construction
pMAR172 is a pUC19 derivative that contains gene carA and 1.1 kb upstream and 2.2 kb downstream flanking DNA in a 4.3 kb KpnI restriction fragment (Cervantes and Murillo, 2002). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) overlap extension method (Ho et al., 1989) was used to mutate specific

Structural basis for CarA-binding to DNA and CarS 991
CarA residues to Ala using pMAR172 as template, two appropriate complementary primers bearing the mutation, a 5 flanking primer 674 bp upstream of carA (RI: 5-AAAA GAATTCGTGATTCAC GCGGCGAAA-3) with an EcoRI site (underlined) and a 3-flanking one 923 bp downstream of carA (XI: 5-AAACTCGAGCCCTGACTCACGTACCCGC G-3) with a XhoI site (underlined) were used. The PCRamplified fragment was cloned into the EcoRI and the XhoIcompatible SalI sites of pBJ113 which contains a kanamycin (Km) resistance gene for positive selection and a galactose (Gal) sensitivity gene for negative selection (Julien et al., 2000). The plasmid construct was electroporated into M. xanthus wild-type strain DK1050 or the carAD strain MR844, and plated on CTT plates containing 40 mg ml-1 Km (Pérez-Marín et al., 2004). Plasmid integration into the chromosome by homologous recombination yields stable Kmr merodiploids containing wild type and mutant carA alleles. Independent merodiploids were grown for several generations in the absence of Km, and then plated on CTT plates supplemented with 10 mg ml-1 Gal to select for the loss of the vector Gals marker. This evicts the vector DNA together with either the wild type or the mutant allele by intramolecular recombination to yield haploid GalrKms cells. Those carrying the mutant carA allele were screened by the colour phenotype and the presence of the mutation was checked by DNA sequencing. Stable production of CarA variants was checked in Western blots with anti-CarA antibodies. Expression at PB, the carB promoter, in the mutant strain was monitored by electroporating it with a 16 kb plasmid pMAR113 (Kmr) with a lacZ transcriptional probe fused to PB (Ruiz-Vázquez et al., 1993). This cannot replicate in M. xanthus but integrates into the chromosome. PB­lacZ expression was monitored qualitatively on CTT plates containing 40 mg ml-1 Xgal, and quantitatively by measuring b-galactosidase activity (Pérez-Marín et al., 2004). For overexpressing CarA(Nter) variants, the coding sequence for each variant was PCR-amplified and cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET15b. purification, thrombin cleavage for H6-tag removal, and concentration determination from the absorbance at 280 nm were carried out as described previously (López-Rubio et al., 2002, 2004; Pérez-Marín et al., 2004). A modified M9 minimal medium with 15NH4Cl and glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources were used to obtain ~10 mg of pure uniformly 15 N-labelled H6-CarA(Nter) protein per litre of culture.

NMR
NMR data were acquired in a Bruker AV-600 NMR spectrometer equipped with a z-shielded gradient triple resonance cryoprobe. NMR samples (0.5 ml) in 5 mm tubes were prepared by dissolving lyophilized CarA(Nter) to ~1 mM in 9:1 H2O : D2O or pure D2O with and 0, 50 or 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6, 6.5, 7 or 7.5). NMR probe temperatures were calibrated with a methanol sample, and sample pH measured was not corrected for isotope effects. Data for structural calculation were acquired at 298 K or as indicated. 2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulphonate (DSS) was the internal 1H chemical shift reference, and 15N chemical shifts were calibrated as described by Wishart et al. (1995). Standard techniques were used for recording spectra and assigning 1H and 15N NMR resonances. Resonance assignments and NOE data for structure determination were obtained from a series of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) experiments. 2D 1H-1H COSY, TOCSY and NOESY (60 and 80­100 ms mixing times respectively), 1H-15N HSQC and 15N-decoupled TOCSY and NOESY, and 3D 15N-NOESY-HSQC, 15N-TOCSY-HSQC data were acquired using conventional pulse sequences and phase-cycling procedures in the phase-sensitive States-TPPI mode (Marion et al., 1989), with selective presaturation or WATERGATE (Piotto et al., 1992) for water signal suppression. The data acquisition matrices were 2048 ¥ 512 data points in f2 and f1, respectively, for 2-D and 2048 ¥ 64 ¥ 240 data points in f3 (1H), f2 (15N), f1 (HN), respectively, for 3-D data. Data were zero filled to twice the number of data points in all dimensions, resolution enhanced with sine-bell or square-sine-bell windows and the shifts were optimized for every spectrum. NMR spectra were processed to the appropriate format with XWINNMR (Bruker, Germany) and NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995), respectively, and were assigned using X-EASY (Bartels et al., 1995) and SPARKY (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco). 1H and 15N NMR resonances were assigned using standard procedures and 2D and 3D spectra of the uniformly 15N-labelled protein obtained in H2O buffers, and homonuclear 2D spectra of the unlabelled protein in H2O and D2O buffers at 298K, pH 7.0 (Wüthrich, 1986). The chemical shift assignments have been deposited in BioMagResBank (reference numbers 15 023 and 15 035; http://www.bmrb. wisc.edu/). Structures of CarA(Nter) were calculated with the program CYANA version 1.0 (Güntert, 2003) with NOE-derived distance constraints, and torsion angle constraints obtained from the analysis of 1H chemical shifts with the program TALOS (Cornilescu et al., 1999). The best structures were refined with the SANDER module of the AMBER 7.0 package (Case et al., 2002), and analysed using the programs PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1996), VADAR (Willard et al., 2003) and

Yeast two-hybrid analysis
Vectors pEG202, for N-terminal protein fusions of CarA to the LexA DBD, and pJG4-5, for a B42 transcriptional activation domain-CarS fusion, used in yeast two-hybrid analyses have been described earlier (López-Rubio et al., 2002). Using similar procedures each mutant carA was PCR-amplified for cloning into the EcoRI­XhoI sites of pEG202 to yield pEG202-X, where X denotes the cloned gene. The recipient yeast strain EGY48 harbouring pSH18-34 was transformed with pEG202-X and pJG4-5-carS, by the lithium acetate method, and streaked on galactose plates supplemented with or without leucine. CarA­CarS interaction was assessed by analysing the blue colour that developed on plates in an Xgal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside) overlay assay, and by measuring b-galactosidase activity for a 14 h induction with galactose as described previously (López-Rubio et al., 2002).

Co-ordinates for the 20 final NMR structures have been deposited in the PDB with accession code 2 JML. Structurally similar proteins were identified using the program DALI (Holm and Sander, 1993). After initially screening for optimal conditions of concentrations, temperature and pH, 1H-15N HSQC titration data were recorded at 45°C in the above buffer with 50 mM each of Arg and Glu included for 100 mM 15N-CarA(Nter) with 0.2, 1, 2 or 3 equivalents of DNA or 0.4, 0.8, 1, 1.5 and 2 equivalents of CarS or H6-CarS1. The mean weighted change in chemical shifts of the amide 1H and 15N was calculated according to D(1H,15N) = [(Dd 2H + Dd 2N/25)/2]1/2 (Grzesiek et al., 1996).

Gel mobility shift assays and gel filtration
Gel-retardation assays were carried out using 5-end 32Plabelled DNA probes, the 130 bp CCR or the 64 bp CCR64, as described previously (Pérez-Marín et al., 2004) except that 8% rather than 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels were used. Band intensities were estimated with a Gel Logic200 Imaging System and Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software V3.6. Gel filtration was carried out with a Superdex-200 column equilibrated with 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM phosphate (pH 7.5), 2 mM b-mercaptoethanol in an AKTA HPLC unit (Amersham Pharmacia). One hundred microlitres of 5­50 mM protein samples (pure proteins or a preincubated mixture of a given CarA(Nter) variant with upto twofold molar excess of CarS or H6-CarS1) were injected into the column, and elution at a flow-rate of 0.3 ml min-1 was tracked by absorbances at 280, 235 and 220 nm. Peak identities were verified by SDS-PAGE. Column calibration carried out as before (Pérez-Marín et al., 2004) yielded log Mr = 7.64­0.209 Ve, where Mr is the apparent molecular weight, and Ve, the elution volume.

Model for CarA-DNA complex
The model for CarA(Nter)-DNA complex was constructed using the crystal structures deposited for MtaN-DNA (PDB code 1R8D) and BmrR-DNA (1R8E) complexes. The structure for the CarA(Cter) dimer was modelled on the basis of its sequence homology to the B12-binding domain of methionine synthase (1BMT) using the program MODELLER (Fiser and Sali, 2003). From the ensemble of structures generated, the one with the lowest energy was selected for further analysis without any additional refinement. The resulting dimer was placed between the two CarA(Nter) modules in the model for the CarA(Nter)-DNA complex. After appropriate translation and rotation, the two N-termini of CarA(Cter) domains were docked close to the C-termini of each of the CarA(Nter) domains in their complex with DNA. The proximal CarA(Nter) and CarA(Cter) modules were then linked, and energy minimized with AMBER. In the minimization, only the conformation of the last three C-terminal residues of CarA(Nter) portion and the first 10 N-terminal residues of CarA(Cter) part were optimized, the atomic co-ordinates for the remainder of the molecule being constrained with the IBELLY option in AMBER (Case et al., 2002).
