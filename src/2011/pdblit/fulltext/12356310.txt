ABSTRACT: Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) is a component of the eosinophil granule matrix. It shows marked toxicity against helminth parasites, bacteria single-stranded RNA viruses, and host epithelial cells. Secretion of human ECP is related to eosinophil-associated allergic, asthmatic, and inflammatory diseases. ECP belongs to the pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily of proteins, and the crystal structure of ECP in the unliganded form (determined previously) exhibited a conserved RNase A fold [Boix, E., et al. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 16794-16801]. We have now determined a high-resolution (2.0 Å) crystal structure of ECP in complex with adenosine 2,5-diphosphate (2,5-ADP) which has revealed the details of the ribonucleolytic active site. Residues Gln-14, His-15, and Lys-38 make hydrogen bond interactions with the phosphate at the P1 site, while His-128 interacts with the purine ring at the B2 site. A new phosphate binding site, P-1, has been identified which involves Arg-34. This study is the first detailed structural analysis of the nucleotide recognition site in ECP and provides a starting point for the understanding of its substrate specificity and low catalytic efficiency compared with that of the eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), a close homologue.

Eosinophils secrete cytotoxic granule proteins, cytokines, and lipid mediators, which when they enter the tissue cause allergic and asthmatic diseases (1, 2). The eosinophil granule primarily contains several multifunctional proteins (3, 4) such as eosinophil cationic protein (ECP),1 eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), eosinophil major basic protein (EMBP), and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO). ECP and EDN belong to the ribonuclease A (RNase A, EC 3.1.27.5) superfamily of proteins and are also known as RNase 3 and RNase 2, respectively (5, 6). Both these proteins, when injected into either rabbits or guinea pigs, cause the neurotoxic Gordon phenomenon (characterized by muscle stiffness, ataxia, incoordination, and spasmodic paralysis) through the loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells (7-9). ECP is involved in the immune response system and has marked toxicity for a variety of helminth parasites, hemoflagellates, bacteria, single-stranded RNA viruses, and the host tissues (10). Serum ECP levels can be used as a clinical tool for the quantitative estimate of inflammatory activity in asthma and other allergic

diseases, and it is related to the severity of the diseases. The antibacterial activity and parasitic toxicity of ECP are higher than those of EDN (11, 12). In vitro, ECP can function as an antiviral agent and may participate in the host defense mechanism against single-stranded RNA respiratory syncytial virus (13). The toxicity of ECP against bacteria and helminths does not seem to be related to its RNase activity (11, 14), while the RNase activity of ECP is required for its antiviral (13) and neurotoxic activity (9). The RNase activity of ECP is known to be 100 times lower than that of EDN for most common RNA substrates, and the in vivo substrates of both these enzymes are yet to be identified. Mature ECP is a small cationic polypeptide of 133 residues, and its molecular mass varies from 16 to 22 kDa due to differences in glycosylation. The amino acid sequence of ECP is 67% identical to that of EDN and 32% to that of RNase A. ECP adopts the kidney-shaped RNase A fold, conserved among all known pancreatic RNase family members (15). ECP also possesses the four disulfide bonds and catalytic residues conserved between EDN and RNase A. However, ECP and EDN show significant differences at the secondary substrate binding sites (16, 17). Also, ECP does not possess the C-mannosylation site found at the N-terminus of EDN (EDN's Trp-7-X-X-Trp-10 motif is replaced with an Arg-7-X-X-Trp-10 motif in ECP) (18). A considerable number of studies on RNase A show multiple binding subsite interactions with RNA. These studies have established the presence of subsites designated as B0Bn, R0-Rn, and P0-Pn, involved in the recognition of base, ribose, and phosphate moieties of the RNA substrate (1921). In addition to the main active site (P1), other phosphate-

(C) Diagram of the 2.0 Å sigmaA 2|Fo| |Fc| electron density map of the ECP-bound 2,5-ADP nucleotide contoured at the 1.0 level.

binding subsites have been identified, which included P2, P0, and P-1. The P2 site binds the 3-phosphate of the nucleotide with the base bound at B2 and the P0 site the 5phosphate of the nucleotide with the base bound at B1 (2123), and the P-1 site is adjacent to the P0 site at the 5-side (22, 24). A new P-1 subsite has been proposed on the basis of the EDN-sulfate complex structure (25). On the basis of structural analyses (17), a similar site was also proposed for ECP, albeit distinct from the P-1 subsite described for RNase A (22). Comparison of the crystal structure of ECP (17) with those of EDN and RNase A shows three main catalytic residues at the P1 subsite which are conserved in all RNase A homologues. In RNase A, these are His-12, Lys-41, and His119 with the equivalent residues being His-15, Lys-38, and His-129 for EDN and His-15, Lys-38, and His-128 for ECP, respectively. The pyrimidine specific B1 subsite and the purine-preferring B2 subsite are partially conserved among RNase A, EDN, and ECP. The B1 subsite residues in RNase

A (Thr-45, Phe-120, and Ser-123) are present in EDN as Thr-42 and Leu-130, and in ECP as Thr-42, Leu-129, and Thr-132, respectively (Figure 1A). The B2 subsite of RNase A, which includes His-119, Asn-71, and Glu-111, is partially conserved in EDN and ECP as His-129 (His-128), Asn-70, and Asp-112, respectively (Figure 1A) (16, 17, 21). Here we present the crystal structure of ECP in complex with 2,5-ADP at 2.0 Å resolution. Three different mononucleotides (2,5-ADP, 3,5-ADP, and 5-ADP) were examined in this study, of which only 2,5-ADP bound to the active site of ECP. This is in contrast to EDN where all three nucleotides bind at the active site as observed from their crystal structures (16). This study on ECP has provided details about the interaction of the ribonucleolytic active site residues Gln-14, Lys-38, His-15, and His-128, and some additional information about the ECP substrate specificity. Mainly, the adenine base binds at the B2 subsite (involving His-128) in ECP, and Arg-34 makes a hydrogen bonding

Mohan et al. The refinement of the structures was carried out using CNS (29) with the native structure of ECP (17) as a starting model. Several alternating cycles of refinement, energy minimization, individual temperature factor refinement, simulated annealing, and model building were performed until the Rfree (30) value could not be further improved. Water molecules were then gradually inserted into the model at positions corresponding to peaks in the |Fo| - |Fc| electron density map with heights greater than 3 and at hydrogen bond forming distances from appropriate atoms. Water molecules with temperature factors of >65 Å2 were excluded from subsequent refinement steps. The nucleotide molecule was included in the final stages of CNS refinement. The details of the refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. The program PROCHECK (31) was used to analyze the quality of the final structure. Analysis of the Ramachandran (-) plot for the structure showed that all residues lie in the allowed regions. Kinetic Analysis of ECP. RNase activity of ECP was measured by a spectrophotometric method. Assays were carried out at 25 °C in 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0) and 0.1 M HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) using a 0.5 cm path length cell. UpA was used as a substrate. Substrate and inhibitor concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using the following extinction coefficients: 261 ) 23 500 M-1 cm-1 for UpA (32) and 259 ) 15 400 M-1 cm-1 for 5-ADP, 2,5-ADP, and 3,5-ADP (33). The activity was measured by following the initial reaction velocities using the difference molar absorbance coefficient ( 286 ) 570 M-1 cm-1) for the transphosphorylation reaction of UpA (34). Ki values were determined by the Dixon method (35) using concentrations of 0.15 and 0.3 mM UpA, and five inhibitor concentrations from 0.0 to 0.2 mM; 1/V0 (where V0 is the initial velocity) was plotted against the inhibitor concentration, [I] (data not shown). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The structure of ECP in complex with 2,5-ADP is shown in Figure 1B. The root-mean-square deviation of the CR atoms of the native ECP (17) and the present ECP-2,5ADP complex structure is 0.31 Å. Fifty-four water molecules were identified in the structure of the ECP-2,5-ADP complex. The active site residues in ECP show no significant conformational change upon nucleotide binding. The side chain of RNase A, His-119, and its EDN counterpart, His-129, are highly mobile and tend to adopt one of two main conformations (A and B), with a 1 of 150° and a 2 of 60° (36, 37). In the RNase A structure, conformation A was identified as the catalytically active conformation (38, 39) and is found to be compatible with substrate binding (16, 39). A similar active conformation has been observed for His-129 in EDN and in complex with 3,5ADP, while in the EDN-2,5-ADP and EDN-5-ADP complexes, this His residue adopts the B conformation (16). Residue His-128 in ECP (in both the native and complex structures) adopts conformation A, with a 1 of 179°. However, in the ECP structure determined by Mallorqui´ Fernandez et al. (40), His-128 adopted an inactive conforma´ tion (conformation B), and this could be attributed to the difference in the crystallization conditions and crystal packing.

interaction with the 5-phosphate group in the ECP-2,5ADP complex, forming a putative P-1 site. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials. Adenosine 2,5-diphosphate (2,5-ADP), adenosine 3,5-diphosphate (3,5-ADP), and adenosine 5diphosphate (5-ADP) were purchased from Sigma. Uridylyl3,5-adenosine (UpA) was purchased from ICN Biochemicals. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Refinement. Recombinant ECP was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (26). Hexagonal crystals of ECP were grown as described by Boix et al. (17). Native ECP crystals were soaked for 48 h prior to data collection with either 25 mM 2,5-ADP, 3,5-ADP, or 5-ADP dissolved in crystallization buffer [0.5 M NaCl, 10% 2-propanol, and 0.1 M HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0)]. A single crystal was used to collect data for each soaking experiment. The ECP crystals soaked with 2,5-ADP diffracted to 2.0 Å resolution on the Synchrotron Radiation Source at Daresbury (Warrington, U.K.) (station PX 9.6), and the data were acquired using an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector system. Data for the ECP crystal soaked with 3,5-ADP were collected on station PX 14.2 to a resolution of 2.2 Å and for 5-ADP on station PX 14.1 to a resolution of 2.85 Å. All data sets were collected at room temperature. Using DENZO (27), all raw data images were first indexed, integrated, and corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. Data were scaled and merged using SCALEPACK (27). Intensities were further truncated to amplitudes using TRUNCATE (28). Details of data collection and processing statistics are presented in Table 1.

Binding of 2,5-ADP to ECP. The structure of 2,5-ADP is well-defined in the electron density map (Figure 1C). When bound to ECP, the deoxyribose moiety of 2,5-ADP adopts the energetically favorable C2-endo anti conformation and a  torsion angle of 69° (Table 2) which is in the synclinal range (+sc), usually found in free nucleotides (41). A stereoview of the binding of 2,5-ADP to ECP is shown in Figure 2. The rms deviation between the CR atoms of the superimposed ECP-2,5-ADP and EDN-2,5-ADP structures is 0.99 Å, and the rms deviations between ECP and the EDN3,5-ADP and EDN-5-ADP structures are 1.1 and 1.0 Å, respectively. The superimposed structures of the ECP-2,5ADP and EDN-2,5-ADP complexes, native ECP with the EDN-3,5-ADP complex, and native ECP with the EDN5-ADP complex are shown in panels A-C of Figure 3, respectively. These show differences in the degree of conformational freedom at the ribonucleolytic active site residues for the adenylic diphosphate nucleotides (2,5-ADP, 3,5-ADP, and 5-ADP) in ECP and EDN. The mode of binding of 2,5-ADP to ECP and EDN is similar. In both cases, the backbone torsion angles () are in +sc range (Table 2). The torsion angle () of the 2,5ADP-ECP complex is anticlinal (+ac; 139°), while that of

a EDN-2,5-ADP complex (PDB entry 1HI3) (16). b Atom numbering for 2,5-ADP is defined according to Figure 1C. c For the EDN complex, conserved waters are considered.

the 2,5-ADP-EDN complex is antiperiplanar (ap; 158°). The other backbone torsion angles are very similar in both cases. Glycosidic torsion angles ( ) of the nucleotide in both ECP and EDN nucleotide complexes differ by 20°, and both are in the anti conformation. The pseudorotation angles 03 are broadly conserved, and also the 5-phosphate torsion angle ( ) is maintained in the ap range (Table 2). The binding of 2,5-ADP to ECP is mainly at the active site P1-B2 region (Figure 2). In the ECP-2,5-ADP complex, the 2-phosphate occupies the P1 site and forms a set of hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Gln-14, His15, and Lys-38 (Table 3 and Figure 2). Similar hydrogen bonding contacts have been observed in the case of the EDN-2,5-ADP complex (Figure 3A and Table 3). In addition, a weak hydrogen bond contact between His-128 and the nucleotide base is observed in the ECP-2,5-ADP complex (Table 3 and Figure 2) which is absent in the EDN2,5-ADP complex. In the ECP-2,5-ADP complex, the adenine ring is not parallel to the imidazole ring of His-128 (Figure 2), but in the case of the EDN-2,5-ADP complex, the adenine ring adopts a conformation which is almost parallel to the imidazole ring of His-129. Interestingly, in

Mohan et al. A novel P-1 subsite region was identified in ECP and EDN, located upstream of the cleavable phosphodiester bond (17, 25). The 5-phosphate group of 2,5-ADP makes a hydrogen bond interaction with the side chain of Arg-34, which is part of this P-1 subsite. The 5-phosphate group also makes hydrogen bonding interactions with symmetryrelated Gln-4 and Tyr-33 residues. The binding of the 5phosphate group in the ECP-2,5-ADP complex takes place in a specific orientation different from that expected from the RNase A binding subsite model where it would be expected to bind at the P2 subsite. In contrast, in the EDN2,5-ADP complex, the 5-phosphate group is not involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with EDN or symmetryrelated molecules. In addition, the main chain of a symmetryrelated Asn-32 residue makes a hydrogen bonding interaction with the amino group of the purine ring in the ECP-2,5ADP complex (Figure 2 and Table 3). The packing interactions involving residues Gln-4, Asn-32, and Tyr-33 are nevertheless conserved between native ECP and EDN. Shifts in the orientations of residues Asn-70 and Asp-112 (which correspond to the B2 subsite) are observed in the ECP-2,5ADP complex when compared to their EDN-2,5-ADP counterparts, although in both cases the corresponding residues do not interact directly with the nucleotide, as only observed for Asn-70 in the EDN-3,5-ADP complex (Figure 3A,B). The lower substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency of ECP might be due to an impaired B2 binding subsite together with the absence of the P2 subsite (17, 26). There are also some differences in the hydrogen bonding interactions of ECP and EDN with 2,5-ADP. In the EDN2,5-ADP complex, there exists a hydrogen bond between Leu-130 and the 2-phosphate group of 2,5-ADP (16), which is not found in the present ECP-2,5-ADP complex structure. In ECP, Asp-112 and Arg-7 make strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the N 2 atom of Arg-7 and the O2 atom of Asp-112. This feature is not observed in EDN, but the corresponding residue in EDN (Trp-7) does make van der Waals interactions with the 3,5-ADP and 5ADP nucleotide (16). The other feature observed in both the ECP and EDN complexes is that the main chain oxygen atom of Trp-10 makes a hydrogen bond with the main chain of Gln-14. There is a major structural rearrangement at the loop region from Asn-32 to Arg-36 due to variation in the primary sequence of ECP and EDN. This is significant since the P-1 subsite residue is located in this region in both the ECP and EDN molecules. There are five water molecules making direct hydrogen bonding interactions with the 2- and 5-phosphates of the nucleotide in the ECP-2,5-ADP complex (Figure 2 and Table 3). Furthermore, both ECP and 2,5-ADP participate in an extended water-mediated hydrogen bonding network involving six water molecules, the side chains of residues Arg-7, Gln-14, Arg-34, and Asn-39, and the main chain of Leu-129 (Figure 2). The nucleotide is also involved in watermediated interactions with the R-amino group of Met-0 at the N-terminus as observed in the EDN-2,5-ADP complex. In addition, 2,5-ADP in the ECP complex also makes van der Waals interactions with the side chains of Met-0 and Asn-41. The main catalytic residues required for RNase activity are conserved in ECP, as in all other members of the mammalian RNase family. Site-directed mutagenesis of two

both the ECP-2,5-ADP and EDN-3,5-ADP complexes, the imidazole ring of His-128 (His-129 in EDN) adopts conformation A, but in the EDN-2,5-ADP complex, the imidazole ring of His-129 adopts conformation B.

Structure of the ECP-2,5-ADP Complex of these residues, Lys-38 to arginine and His-128 to aspartate, eliminates the RNase activity of ECP (11). Another important fact is that the weakening of the His-128-Asp-130 interaction in eosinophil RNases may explain the reduction in activity and the lower pH range for the optimum activity of its transphosphorylation reaction (15). In RNase A, the corresponding His-119-Asp-121 catalytic dyad does play an important role in this reaction (19). The histidine-aspartic acid catalytic dyad could contribute for the respective RNase activities in RNase A, EDN, and ECP. Interestingly, from the crystal structure analysis, this interaction is found to be stronger (based on the distance) in RNase A (2.6 Å) than in EDN (2.8 Å), and no interaction is observed in ECP (4.6 Å). Several orthologs of ECP have been identified and characterized enzymatically. All of them maintain the classic catalytic triad (His-15, Lys-38, and His-128) and have the conserved Gln-14 residue. Also, an evolutionary analysis of the single sequence homologue of ECP and/or EDN in the primate ribonuclease gene family has been carried out by Rosenberg et al. (42). The results of this analysis have clearly suggested two novel functions: increased cationicity and/or toxicity (ECP) and enhanced ribonuclease activity (EDN) arising due to evolutionary constraints (43). However, the relative catalytic efficiency of these ECP orthologs, and that of the single sequence of EDN and/or ECP found among the New World monkey species, could not be predicted with the available crystallographic and kinetic data. Lack of Binding of 3,5-ADP and 5-ADP to Crystalline ECP. We have repeatedly tested the binding of 3,5-ADP and 5-ADP nucleotides to ECP (by cocrystallization and soaking methods), but no binding was observed in the crystal. A simple modeling exercise in which the 3,5-ADP and 5ADP nucleotides from the respective EDN complexes are superimposed on the active site of ECP shows distinct steric clashes (Figure 3B,C). His-128 and Trp-35 (symmetry-related molecule) from ECP are directly involved in these clashes. Docking analysis was also performed using the AUTODOCK program (44) to check the nucleotide binding ability to the enzyme. Among the three nucleotides that were studied here, none of them predicted the required conformational arrangement (or the mode of binding) for making the hydrogen bonding interactions with the enzyme. Inhibition of ECP Enzymatic ActiVity by 2,5-ADP, 3,5ADP, and 5-ADP. The inhibition constants for these adenylic nucleotides have been determined spectrophotometrically. Kinetic assays were initially carried out at pH 8.0, the pH used for the crystallization buffer to grow ECP crystals. However, the kinetic analysis at pH 8.0 with the spectrophotometric assay did not allow the determination of the Ki value as the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme was very low and the inhibitor-enzyme interactions very weak; therefore, a detailed kinetic analysis was performed at pH 6.0 to increase the affinity of the inhibitor for the enzyme. The estimated Ki values at pH 6.0 obtained from the study presented here and obtained using the Dixon plot analysis are in the range of 2-3 µM for 5-ADP and 6-7 µM for 2,5-ADP and 3,5-ADP. The results indicate that there are no significant differences in the affinity constants between the three assayed adenylic nucleotides. However, our crystallographic data clearly show the binding of only 2,5-ADP to ECP in the crystalline state due to steric clashes (see

Biochemistry, Vol. 41, No. 40, 2002 12105 above). Previous kinetic characterization of eosinophil RNases (15) reported an activity optimum of 6.5. An increased nucleotide affinity should also be expected at an even lower pH, as described for RNase A (45). Therefore, lower Ki values would be expected for the mononucleotides at pH 6.0 than at pH 8.0. Previous kinetic analyses of EDN have shown that 3,5-ADP has a slightly higher binding affinity for EDN (lower Ki value) than 2,5-ADP and 5ADP (16). However, the comparison of the determined Ki values with the reported ones in the literature should take into account the differences in both the pH and ionic strength of the assay mixture. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of the crystal structure of the ECP-2,5-ADP complex has enabled us to identify for the first time some of the key residues involved in the substrate specificity of ECP, i.e., the P1, B2, and P-1 subsites. The P1 subsite is conserved in ECP, EDN, and all pancreatic RNase superfamily members that have been examined. The B2 subsite of ECP does bind adenine as in RNase A and EDN nucleotide complexes. A P-1 subsite has been identified in the ECP-2,5-ADP complex presented here, and this site is conserved in EDN but not in RNase A. The molecular basis of RNase activity inhibition has yet to be understood in ECP, particularly in view of its lower substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency. Meanwhile, further analysis of ECP-nucleotide complexes which are currently in progress might prove to be useful for the design of inhibitors.
