Abstract A 23-kDa antifungal thaumatin-like protein was isolated and purified from Cassia didymobotrya (Fres.) cell cultures for the first time. The protein was secreted in the culture medium, but it could be also isolated after elution of whole cells with a 0.5 M CaCl2 solution. Treatment of the cells with laminarin oligosaccharides or salicylic acid, but not with NaCl, resulted in enhancement of expression of the protein. A rapid purification protocol was used based on cationic exchange chromatography. The protein, with a highly basic character (pI 10), has an exact molecular mass of 23034 Da, as determined by MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry analysis. N-terminal sequencing of the intact polypeptide and the sequencing of two internal tryptic peptides indicated significant identity with other thaumatin-like proteins (TLP). The protein exerted antifungal activity towards some Candida species showing EC50 values comparable to those of other antifungal TLPs. The collected data lead to classify this TLP as a new PR-5 protein. © 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Higher plants protect themselves from various stresses such as pathogen attacks by producing constitutive or inducible proteins and peptides known as "Pathogenesis-Related Proteins" (PRPs). These are classified into seventeen families based on sequence similarities, serologic or immunologic relationships, and enzymatic properties [1]. Thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) belonging to group 5 (PR-5), are proteins commonly found both in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species, that

show primary sequences and structural arrangements similar to the sweet tasting protein Thaumatin isolated from Thaumatococcus danielli [2]. Most of the known PR-5 proteins play a defensive role against pathogenic fungi [3­7]; the antifungal activity is correlated with plasma membrane permeabilization as observed for zeamatin [8] and tobacco osmotin [9] PR-5 proteins. Some authors relate the antifungal activity to a structural feature common to the antifungal PR-5 proteins, represented by a central cleft formed by domains I and II [10,11]. This cleft, rich in hydrophobic and acidic residues, is believed to interact with specific receptors present on the fungal-cell membrane. However, the precise mechanism by which PR-5 proteins exert their antifungal activity has not been clearly elucidated. The defensive role was also attributed to -amylase inhibitor [12] or endo -1,3-glucanase-like activities [13,14]. Another established function attributed to a subgroup of PR-5 proteins, known as osmotins, is a regulatory role induced by osmotic stress; osmo-

tins were in fact discovered in tomato plants and cell cultures stressed upon treatment with NaCl [15]. Other biological activities have been further attributed to PR-5 proteins which have been found to act as protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors [16], while others were involved in immune reactions as allergens [17,18]. So far, several TLPs derived from different plant sources and tissues have been isolated, purified and cloned [7,19­21] allowing the elucidation of many of their structural and functional properties [10,11,21]. Plant cell cultures of Cassia didymobotrya [22] have been studied for their secondary metabolites production [23] and for their protein content, and were found to produce and release into the culture medium several proteins including peroxidase isoenzymes [24] and a group of low molecular weight polypeptides. Our work describes some biochemical and functional aspects of a new antifungal TLP purified from cell cultures of Cassia didymobotrya. 2. Results 2.1. CdTLP Purification A new thaumatin-like protein (CdTLP) was purified from the medium of Cassia didymobotrya cell cultures by means of two cation exchange chromatographic procedures. The first step allowed the recovery of a basic protein fraction from the medium, while the second column allowed the recovery, by elution with a salt linear gradient, of a pure form of the CdTLP with a 23 kDa molecular mass. (Fig. 1, lane 5). The cell-wall protein fraction obtained by washing whole cells with a 0.5 M CaCl2 solution, was separated employing the same procedure applied for the medium and the two preparations resulted in protein yields ranging from 0.045 mg to 0.06 mg per gram of cell (fresh weight). The basic fraction was also separated using RP- HPLC for analytical purposes, and two

main peaks were collected (Fig. 2). Their subsequent Nterminal sequence analysis indicated that CdTLP was recovered in a pure form in peak 1, as confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, inset) and MALDI ToF mass spectrometry analysis (not shown). 2.2. Expression and induction In order to monitor the CdTLP expression rate during cell growth, fixed amounts of culture medium were collected every three days and analyzed by RP-HPLC. The concentration of the CdTLP released in the medium raised in the first 10 days of growth; a plateau was reached after the 12th day, when the amount of CdTLP was estimated to be around 5 moles*gr-1 of cell fresh weight (results not shown). Treatment of cells with salicylic acid (30 M) or with a preparation of laminarin oligosaccharides (final concentration 150 g.ml-1), increased the production of CdTLP in the first 48 hours by 6- and 8- fold, respectively (Fig. 3). When cells were grown in a medium containing a final concentration of NaCl 0.5 M, no noticeable enhancement in the CdTLP production was observed (results not shown). SA or laminarin oligosaccharides used at such concentrations did not cause any cytotoxic effect on the cells, while NaCl slightly inhibited cell growth (results not shown). 2.3. Biochemical characterization The N-terminal amino acid analysis of the CdTLP obtained by automated Edman sequencing from PVDF blotted protein, yielded a 31 amino acid residue sequence: ATITFTNKCTRTVWPGTLTGDQKPQLSKTGF Purified CdTLP was subjected to proteolytic cleavage in order to gain further information on its sequence. After RPHPLC purification of the tryptic digest, two major fragments of 12 and 15 residues were found and their respective sequences were determined to be TGFELASGVSTR and GAAPPATLIELTVAS. The first sequence partially overlapped the 1-31 N-terminal sequence resulting in the following 1-40 residues N-terminal sequence: ATITFTNKCTRTVWPGTLTGDQKPQLSKTGFELASGVSTR A sequence alignment (Fig. 4, top) with other thaumatinlike proteins showed a high degree of identity of CdTLP with Prunus persica TLP (80%), Medicago sativa TLP (80%), Malus domestica PR-5 (75%), Castanea sativa and Glycine soja TLPs (67%). The 15 residues internal sequence showed a 80% of identity with the Medicago truncatula and Prunus persica TLPs (Fig. 4, bottom). CdTLP is a highly basic protein as determined from isoelectrofocusing experiments in which a pI of 10 could be estimated (not shown).

form of CdTLP, only the non-glycosylated form of CdTLP was employed in this work in all the antifungal assays. Unlike other PR-5 proteins, CdTLP did not show any detectable -amylase inhibitory or -1,3-glucanase activity. 2.4. Antifungal activity of CdTLP The antifungal activity of CdTLP was tested in vitro and determined by measuring the effect of increasing concentrations of protein (1.2 M, 2.2 M, 5.4 M, 10.8 M and 21.6 M) on different species of fungi. On a time course ranging from 18 to 24 hours of incubation at 30 °C, inihibitory growth effects against Candida albicans (586), Candida krusei (ATCC 14243, 80) and Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) strains were monitored, showing EC50 values ranging from 2.2 M to 6.2 M (Table 1). No growth inhibitory activity was observed on Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida tropicalis or Torulopsis glabrata even at concentrations of CdTLP above 20 M (results not shown). 3. Discussion One of the advantages represented by plant cell culture systems is that many relevant biochemical compounds, such as secondary metabolites and proteins, are released into the culture medium. In our study the secreted thaumatin-like protein from Cassia didymobotrya could be purified applying a rapid and efficient purification protocol that employed two cation exchange columns: the amount of CdTLP obtained from each preparation ranged from 2 to 4 mg*l-1 of medium, corresponding to 0.04-0.066 mg*gr-1 of cell fresh weight. Such a high yield makes of the Cassia didymobotrya cell cultures a valuable system for the production of antifungal TLPs, even when

CdTLP concentration was estimated on the basis of the HPLC peak area integration after calibration with a pure sample of CdTLP. Standard deviation is represented by the black tops.

MALDI-TOF analysis performed on a pure CdTLP sample, resulted in a [M+H]+ value of 23035.9, a [M+2H]2+ of 11519.1, a [M+3H]3+ of 7675.16 and a [M+4H]4+ of 5752.2, with a resulting molecular mass of 23035 Da (not shown). CdTLP was positive for PAS-Schiff staining after SDSPAGE and when a CdTLP preparation was applied to a Concanavalin A column, 5% of the total amount bound to it and could be eluted with a 0.5 M -D-mannopyranoside solution (data not shown). Due to the low amount of the glycosylated

compared to the reported systems based on microorganism expression [25,26]. Moreover it must be pointed out the possibility of enhancing the CdTLP production in this system up to a 32 mg/L of yield, by adding SA or laminarin oligosaccharides to the cell culture. As many other thaumatin-like proteins, CdTLP displays a strong basic character with an isoelectric point of pI 10 and a molecular weight (23034 Da) comparable to other TLPs. The MALDI-ToF analysis performed on pure CdTLP, showed a typical protein spectrum in which a value of 23035.9 [M+H]+ was observed. A lower peak at about 23868 amu, could indicate the presence of some carbohydrate groups, as confirmed by PAS-Schiff staining and by the affinity of CdTLP for ConA resin, suggesting that this TLP is a glycoprotein. Further studies are needed to shed more light on this aspect; it is likely, in fact, that this kind of post-translational modification may occur even in other thaumatin-like proteins as found in the PR-5 TLP from Pyrus serotina [27]. CdTLP was also isolated and purified from CaCl2 washings of intact cells. Similar procedures of cell wall protein isolation have been employed for HRGP

(hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins) and peroxidases [28,29] purification. The amount of CdTLP purified after CaCl2 treatment of whole cells, comparable to that obtained from the culture medium, indicates that a large amount of this protein is stored in the cell wall compartment, in order to be readily available as defensive tools against pathogen attacks. In order to understand the physiological roles of CdTLP, C. didymobotrya cell suspension cultures were treated with NaCl, laminarin oligosaccharides or salicylic acid (SA). Some plant tissues and cell cultures, when treated with sodium chloride, show an increase in the expression of osmotins [30,31]. Cassia didymobotrya is a plant naturally growing in semi-arid areas where dehydration is frequent. In order to mimic drought conditions, we have treated suspension cultures of Cassia didymobotrya with NaCl, but since the expression of CdTLP was not affected by such stimulus, we concluded that this protein does not behave as an osmotin-like protein. Laminarin oligosaccharides have been found to be elicitors of the defensive response in cells of tobacco, promoting an enhancement of the expression of SA and therefore of PRPs proteins [32]. SA itself is a plant signal compound which triggers the systemic acquired response and has a role in the localized hypersensitive response in inducing the expression of the pathogenesis related proteins PR-1, PR-2, PR-5, -1,3-glucanase, and glutathione S-transferase [33]. CdTLP expression was increased eight-fold in the presence of low micromolar amounts of SA and six-fold when treated with laminarin, which suggests a possible involvement of CdTLP in the defensive mechanisms of this species.

Some interesting points arise from the analysis of the antifungal activity. The yeast growth inhibitory effect was differently exerted depending on the fungal species tested: Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) and C. krusei (ATCC 14243) were inhibited by concentrations of CdTLP of 2.2 M and a 2.5 M respectively, a higher amount (5.4 M) had to be employed to induce the same effect on C. krusei (80) and C. albicans (586) strains (Table 1). Interestingly, the other three tested species, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Torulopsis glabrata were not effected at all even at higher concentration (> 20 M) of CdTLP, suggesting a species specificity mechanism, as previously observed by other authors for other TLPs [9]. The interesting hypothesis that glycosylation, observed for this thaumatin-like protein, could also be involved in the mechanism of protein-pathogen recognition and hence in the antifungal activity, is going to be investigated in the future. CdTLP was shown to lack in -glucanase-like activity and in inhibiting bacterial and fungal -amylases; this last result however, should be cautiously considered taking in account that the inhibitory activity reported for zeamatin was only exerted towards insect -amylase [12]. The thaumatin-like protein isolated from Cassia didymobotrya suspension cultures can be considered as a new member of the PR-5 family proteins. The expression induced by laminarin oligosaccharides or salicylic acid, the antifungal activity and the high identity values obtained when comparing the sequence with the N-terminal sequences shared by other PR-5 proteins, are all evidence pointing towards such classification for this new antifungal TLP. 4. Methods 4.1. Plant material and chemicals Chemicals and reagents were purchased from SigmaAldrich, Bruker Daltonics and Bio-Rad. Seeds of Cassia didymobotrya (Fresen) were obtained from Chiltern Seeds, Cumbria, (UK). Cell suspension cultures of Cassia didymobotrya have been optimized and grown as described [22]. 4.2. CaCl2 Cell washing In order to obtain the wall-bound proteins fraction, cells (10 g) were collected after 20 days of growth, filtered until dryness and subsequently poured into an empty glass column (7.5 i.d. x 20 cm). The column was filled with water in order to wash the cells; after elution of the resulting liquid, the column was filled with a cold (4 °C) CaCl2 solution (0.5 M) at a 5:1 (ml for gram of fresh cell weight) ratio to completely submerge the cells. The mixture was left to settle for 15 minutes; thereafter the column was opened, the eluting sample collected and dialyzed against water overnight for further analysis.

4.3. Treatment with laminarioligosaccharides , salicylic acid, and NaCl Laminarioligosaccharides were obtained from laminarin hydrolysis performed with 50% (v/v) TFA at 100 °C as reported [34]. The resulting solution was neutralized with NaOH and freeze-dried. After 5 days of growth, five cultures were treated with SA (30 M, final concentration) and five with laminarioligosaccharides (150 g.ml-1, final concentration). After 48 hours the medium was filtered, freeze-dried and analyzed by RP-HPLC. NaCl treatment was performed by adding to the culture medium the salt at a final concentration of 0.1 M. After a growth period of 15 days the culture medium was filtered, freeze-dried and analyzed by RP-HPLC (see paragraph 4.5 for analysis details). 4.4. CdTLP Purification Cell culture medium (1 L) was collected at 20 days of cell growth. After centrifugation at 6000 g for 30 minutes to remove cell debris, the medium was treated with a 10% (w/v) of insoluble polyvinylpolypyrrolidone overnight at 4 °C in order to remove the majority of phenolic compounds. The resulting clarified solution was concentrated and equilibrated in 25 mM Na acetate buffer (pH 6.0) by ultrafiltration (Viva Flow 50, 10 kDa cut-off). When the sample reached 20 ml, it was loaded onto a XK-50 (7.5 × 30 cm) column (Amersham) packed with CM Sepharose Fast-Flow (Amersham) resin equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with five volumes of 25 mM Na acetate (pH 6.0) and then eluted with two volumes of a NaCl (0.5 M) solution in the same buffer. The resulting "basic fraction" was dialyzed overnight against 3 l of water, using a SpectraPor 1 (MWCO: 6­8 kDa) membrane and then freeze-dried. The resulting powder was dissolved in 2 ml of 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6) and applied to a column (30 × 1 cm) packed with CM MacroPrep resin (Bio-Rad, CA) equilibrated with 20 mM Naacetate buffer (pH 6.0). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 ml.min-1 with a linear gradient of NaCl (0­500 mM) in the same buffer. 4.5. HPLC analysis and purification Two HPLC methods, employing a Hewlett & Packard 1100 HPLC with a PDA (Photo Diode Array) detector system, were used. 0.1% (v/v) aqueous TFA (solvent A) and acetonitrile/0.1% (v/v) aqueous TFA (80:20 v/v) (solvent B) were used in both the methods. For preparative runs a C8 Vydac column (8 m, 1 × 25 cm) was employed in a linear gradient system (0% solvent A to 85% solvent B in 65 min, at 1.2 ml.min-1 flow rate). For analytical runs a Hypersil BDS C-18 column (3 m, 4.6 × 100 mm) was used in a linear gradient (0% solvent A to 85% solvent B in 50 min, 1.0 ml.min-1 flow rate). Elution

of proteins was monitored at 280 and 214 nm, and fractions corresponding to the peaks were collected and freeze dried. 4.6. Amino acid sequence determination N-terminal sequences were determined from protein bands excised from PVDF membranes (ProblottTM) after electroblotting. For the characterization of internal sequences, purified CdTLP was carboxylated with iodoacetamide. The lyophilized sample was suspended in 0.2 ml of 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate and incubated at 37° for 3 h after addition of 0.03 mg of trypsin. The peptide mixture was purified using a Beckman System Gold HPLC on a macroporous reversed-phase column (Aquapore RP-300, 4.6 mm × 250 mm). Amino acid sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation using a Perkin-Elmer model AB476A sequencer. 4.7. Electrophoresis SDS-PAGE was carried out as reported [35] on a 12% (w/v) acrylamide gel or on a 8-20% (w/v) gradient gel system when necessary. Electro-blotting was performed in a Towbin transfer buffer system (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol, pH 8.3) at 50 Volts for 30 minutes. The isoelectric point was determined by isoelectrofocusing on horizontal gels prepared with a pI 3-10 ready strip gel in a Protean IEF (BioRad Lab, CA) chamber. 4.8. MALDI-ToF analysis MALDI mass spectra were acquired with an Autoflex TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker-Daltonics, Bremen, DE) equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser (337 nm). Analysis of pure CdTLP was performed in a linear mode. A Protein Calibration Standard II (Bruker-Daltonics) mixture was used for instrument calibration. All spectra were acquired using an accelerating voltage of 25 kV and a grid voltage of 80%. Two hundredfifty shots were added to give the best signal to noise level. The sample (5 M), after purification, was lyophilized and suspended in a TFA 0.1% (v/v) solution. A 0.5 l volume of sample was mixed with an equal volume of a matrix solution prepared dissolving -hydroxy-cinnamic acid (Bruker-Daltonics) in acetonitrile/ TFA 0.1% (70/30 v/v). CdTLP was also analyzed from excised portions of SDS-PAGE gels following the rapid method as reported in: [www.hmc.psu.edu/core/oldsite/ Maldi/othermalditofprotocols.htm]. 4.9. Protein concentration and enzymatic assays Protein concentration was determined following the method of Bradford [36]. -amylase was assayed as reported in [12], employing enzymes from Bacillus sp. and Aspergillus oryzae (SIGMA), while -glucanase activity was tested as reported in [37].

4.10. Antifungal activity and other biological assays The assay for antifungal activity was carried out in 96-wells microplates (Nunc) filled with Potato Dextrose Broth (Sigma) and incubated at 23 °C for 72 hrs. After incubation in a Sabouroud agar (DIFCO), yeast strains have been diluted at a final concentration of 0.5 McFarland medium with distilled water. From this solution 20 l have been taken and diluted in 10 ml of Potato Dextrose Broth. Cassia d. TLP was diluted with the same medium at 50, 25 and 12.5 g/ 100 l. To the resulting solutions were added 100 l of yeast preparation. The control wells contained 100 l of water and 100 l of fungi suspension. Fungistatic effects were monitored by reading the O.D. at 660 nm and the EC50 values were calculated as described [38]. Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank M.E.
