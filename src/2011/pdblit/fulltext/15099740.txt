Implications for Switching Restriction Enzyme Specificities from the Structure of BstYI Bound to a BglII DNA Sequence
Sharon A. Townson,1 James C. Samuelson,2 Shuang-yong Xu,2 and Aneel K. Aggarwal1,* 1 Structural Biology Program Department of Physiology & Biophysics Mount Sinai School of Medicine 1425 Madison Avenue New York, New York 10029 2 New England Biolabs, Inc. 32 Tozer Road Beverly, Massachusetts 01915 cleavage pattern (Aggarwal, 1995; Pingoud and Jeltsch, 2001; Pingoud et al., 2002). For example, sticky end cutters, such as EcoRI and BamHI, which cleave DNA to leave four base (5#) overhangs, or blunt end cutters, such as EcoRV and PvuII, which cleave DNA to produce blunt ends, have more structural elements in common (Athanasiadis et al., 1994; Newman et al., 1994a). Using the knowledge gained from these structures, a number of attempts have been made to alter the specificity of restriction enzymes by both single-site and cassette mutagenesis (Alves et al., 1989; Dorner et al., 1999; Flores et al., 1995; Horton and Perona, 1998; Lanio et al., 2000; Osuna et al., 1991; Schottler et al., 1998; Wenz et al., 1998; Whitaker et al., 1999; Xu and Schildkraut, 1991). In general, these attempts have been unsuccessful. For instance, the structure of the BamHI-DNA complex reveals that the enzyme recognizes its cognate sequence GGATCC primarily through residues Asn116, Ser118, Arg122, Asp154, and Arg155 (Newman et al., 1995). However, attempts to select BamHI mutants to recognize the closely related BglII site AGATCT based on the cassette mutagenesis of these residues have been unsuccessful (I. Schildkraut, personal communication). To understand the basis of this resilience, we have determined structures of BamHI and BglII, both in the presence and absence of DNA (Lukacs and Aggarwal, 2001; Lukacs et al., 2000; Lukacs et al., 2001; Newman et al., 1994a; Newman et al., 1994b, 1995; Viadiu and Aggarwal, 2000). As expected, the structures reveal a similar / core and commonalities in some of the DNA recognition elements. However, despite these commonalities in enzyme structure, the DNA is contorted differently in the two DNA complexes, leading to different DNA contacts for even the common inner GATC base pairs. Moreover, the mechanism of DNA capture is different: a clamping motion in the case of BamHI and a large scissor-like motion in the case of BglII (Vanamee et al., 2004). We undertook the structural characterization of BstYI in an effort to find a better candidate for specificity switch experiments. BstYI, (from Bacillus stearothermophilus Y406) is a 203 amino acid residue thermophilic enzyme that recognizes the degenerate hexanucleotide sequence 5#-RGATCY-3# (where R = A or G and Y = C or T) and cleaves after the 5#-R on each DNA strand to produce four-base (5#) staggered ends. The recognition sequence of BstYI overlaps with that of BamHI (GGATCC) and BglII (AGATCT), and the enzyme shares 22 and 30% sequence identities with BamHI and BglII, respectively. Thus, as an "intermediate" endonuclease with the specificity of both BamHI and BglII, it is of substantial interest to see how BstYI is able to recognize and cleave a degenerate DNA sequence and whether its mode of DNA recognition is "BamHI-like," "BglII-like," or in between the two. Curiously, a genetic variant of BstYI has been isolated that prefers to cleave the BglII sequence (AGATCT), suggesting that BstYIDNA recognition is perhaps more structurally akin to BglII than to BamHI (Samuelson and Xu, 2002). Recently, we reported the structure of the free BstYI

Summary The type II restriction endonuclease BstYI recognizes the degenerate sequence 5 -RGATCY-3 (where R = A/G and Y = C/T), which overlaps with both BamHI (GGATCC) and BglII (AGATCT), and thus raises the question of whether BstYI DNA recognition will be more BamHI-like or BglII-like. We present here the structure of BstYI bound to a cognate DNA sequence (AGATCT). We find the complex to be more BglII-like with similarities mapping to DNA conformation, domain organization, and residues involved in catalysis. However, BstYI is unique in containing an extended arm subdomain, and the mechanism of DNA capture has both BglII-like and BamHI-like elements. Further, DNA recognition is more minimal than BglII and BamHI, where only two residues mediate recognition of the entire core sequence. Taken together, the structure reveals a mechanism of degenerate DNA recognition and offers insights into the possibilities and limitations in altering specificities of closely related restriction enzymes. Introduction Type II restriction endonucleases display exceptional specificity in protein-DNA recognition. They generally recognize short DNA sequences of 4­8 bp in length and require only Mg2+ to catalyze the hydrolysis of DNA (Roberts and Halford, 1993). Strikingly, a single variation in the DNA recognition sequence results in over a million-fold loss in activity. Over 3500 bacterial and viral enzymes have been characterized to date, representing hundreds of specificities (Roberts et al., 2003). Together, their abundance and selectivity have made these enzymes attractive models for studying DNA recognition and for potentially engineering new specificities. Comparison of their protein sequences, however, reveals little or no similarities, suggesting that these enzymes might be structurally and mechanistically diverse (Vanamee and Aggarwal, 2004). Crystal structures of over a dozen bacterial restriction endonucleases have now been determined and they reveal a common / core, with additional structural homologies beyond the core domain correlated to the DNA

dimer at 1.85 Å resolution (Townson et al., 2004). As expected, the structure reveals a similar / core as BamHI and BglII, though in BstYI the / core is embellished by an extended "arm" substructure that enables the enzyme to adopt a more compact, intertwined dimer structure. We report here the structure of BstYI in complex with a cognate BglII DNA sequence (AGATCT). The structure reveals the basis for degenerate DNA recognition and offers insights into possibilities and limitations in changing the specificities of closely related restriction enzymes. Results and Discussion Structure Determination The gene coding for the BstYI restriction endonuclease was cloned from B. stearothermophilus Y406 genomic DNA and overexpressed in a three-plasmid expression system: bstYIR gene on pET21at, bstYIM gene on pACYC for host DNA protection, and LysS on a pSC101 derivative for minimization of residual expression. Selenomethionyl BstYI was expressed in the presence of selenomethionine (SeMet) and by inhibiting the methionine synthesis pathway. Native and SeMet BstYI endonuclease samples were concentrated to w35 mg ml-1 and incubated with a 1.5 M equivalent of the 14 bp selfannealed duplex 5#-TTATAGATCTATAA-3#. Cocrystals were initially obtained from solutions of sodium citrate, but were mosaic and did not diffract better than 3.5 Å. Microseeding the original cocrystals and growing them under the same conditions subsequently yielded well ordered monoclinic cocrystals. These crystals contained one enzyme dimer bound to a DNA duplex in the asymmetric unit. For phasing, multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) data were measured from a SeMet derivative. An experimental electron density map was calculated at 2.7 Å using the MAD data. The good quality of the map enabled most of the protein and the DNA to be built. Further rounds of refinement, including noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging, resulted in a final model with good statistics and stereochemistry (Table 1). A total of 104 solvent molecules were included in the final refined model. Overall Structure The BstYI dimer approaches DNA from the major groove side and wraps around to the "back" side of the DNA (Figure 1). As anticipated, the DNA fits into the large cleft of the dimer. The two BstYI subunits bind in a classical "crossover" manner (Aggarwal, 1995), where the "left" subunit cleaves and makes most of its phosphate contacts to the left DNA half-site, but makes almost all of its base pair contacts to the right subunit, and vice versa for the "right" subunit. The BstYI monomer is composed of three substructures: an / core domain, an extended "arm" subdomain, and a small two-stranded  subdomain at the base of the binding cleft (Figure 1). Each BstYI subunit contributes three loops (A, B, and C) that reach into the major groove on the "front" and "back" sides of the DNA. Unlike BamHI and BglII, there are no contacts to bases in the minor groove of the recognition sequence. The DNA remains

B form, though mild bending and local under- and overwinding cause some distortion.

Protein Conformation The BstYI / core domain is similar to that of BamHI and BglII, comprised of a central mixed six-stranded  sheet (1, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2) surrounded by seven  helices (1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9), two of which are involved in dimerization (7 and 9) (Figure 1). As in BamHI and BglII, the loops (A and B) preceding the dimerization helices fit into the major groove on the front side of the DNA and carry the residues for specific recognition. In BstYI, an extended "arm" subdomain, unlike anything previously seen in the BamHI and BglII structures, embellishes the / core domain. The subdomain results from the extension of 2 and 3 strands beyond the core domain and the acquisition of two additional helices (5 and 6). The arm from one subunit reaches across to make contacts with the / core domain of the symmetry-related subunit, giving rise to a unique intertwined BstYI dimer. Previously, from the structure of the free enzyme, we proposed that this "arm" subdomain contributed to the thermostability of BstYI because it increases the packing and the buried surface area at the dimer interface (Townson et al., 2004). The complex structure now reveals a subsidiary role for this subdomain in DNA binding. The 2 and 3 strands extend across the top of the DNA and several residues along 3 make contacts with the phosphate backbone (Figure 1). Additionally, a tyrosine residue (Tyr115) on 3 makes a direct base contact with the DNA through a hydrogen bond to an adenine residue outside of the core recognition sequence (TTATAGATCT ATAA). This interaction, which occurs in both DNA halfsites, acts to fix both ends of the DNA duplex at either side of the binding cleft. Thus, the extended arm subdomain in BstYI enables the enzyme to make additional DNA contacts that are not present in either the BamHI or BglII complexes. BamHI and BglII both contain a substructure at the base of the / core that wraps around to the backside of the DNA. In BamHI, this substructure consists of a small two-stranded  sheet (2 and 8) and an  helix (7) that unfolds on specific DNA binding (Newman et al., 1994a, 1995). In BglII, this substructure is elaborated into a full five-stranded  sandwich domain (2, 8, 9, 10, and 11) that orients one loop (loop D, following 2) into the major groove and another (loop C, between 8 and 9) into the minor groove of the DNA (Lukacs et al., 2000; Lukacs et al., 2001) (Figure 1). The fitting of these loops into grooves on the backside of the DNA leads to the complete encirclement of the DNA in the BglII complex. The BstYI complex reveals an analogous substructure that positions a loop (C), which is equivalent to loop D in BglII, into the DNA major groove, making contacts with the sugar-phosphate backbone. However, this substructure in BstYI is much more minimal than in BglII, comprised of only a small two-stranded  sheet (7 and 8), with no equivalent of loop C in BglII projecting into the minor groove (Figure 1). In effect, BstYI encloses the DNA in its binding cleft but to a lesser extent than BglII.

Conformational Changes upon DNA Binding BamHI and BglII have surprisingly distinct modes of DNA binding. The BamHI dimer binds DNA via a "clamp-like" motion, in which each subunit closes onto the DNA by a 10° rotation around the DNA axis (Newman et al., 1995). BglII accommodates DNA by a "scissor-like" motion in which each subunit swings open by as much as 50° in a direction parallel to the bound DNA axis (Lukacs et al., 2001) (Figure 2). Intriguingly, BstYI incorporates elements of both clamping and scissorlike motions. In comparing the free BstYI structure to that of the complex, each subunit rotates by w5° around the DNA axis (clamping) and w8° perpendicular to the DNA axis (scissor-like). Together, this "twisting" motion causes a tightening of the DNA binding cleft where, for example, the distance between symmetryrelated Thr41 residues at the rim of the cleft changes from w38 to w34 Å and the distance between symmetry-related Ser172 at the base of the cleft (on loop B) changes from w26 to w19 Å (Figure 2). BstYI also undergoes local conformational changes upon DNA binding. Loop C, encompassing residues 42­52 between strands 7 and 8, is disordered in the free enzyme but becomes ordered in the complex and projects into the major groove on the back side of the DNA (Figure 2). The equivalent loop (loop D) in BglII also undergoes a similar disorder to order transition on DNA binding (Lukacs et al., 2001). In BstYI, a particularly striking local change is the shift in the extended arm subdomain toward the DNA backbone. In the free structure, the arm subdomain makes stabilizing dimer contacts with / core of the symmetry-related subunit, wherein the N terminus of helix 5 packs against the dimerization helix 9. Because the arm subdomain moves in unison with the / core of the symmetry related subunit these dimer contacts are preserved in the

complex. The DNA is locked into position by this rigid body movement in arm subdomain (Figure 2), with the elongated 3 strand tracking and making contact with the sugar-phosphate backbone and Tyr115 on 3 forming a hydrogen bond to the N3 of a flanking adenine (TTATAGATCTATAA). DNA Conformation Like the BglII and BamHI DNA, the BstYI DNA bends mildly away from the protein / core (w6­8° over the 10 central base pairs) (Figure 3A). In terms of local helical parameters, the BstYI DNA conformation is closer to the BglII DNA than to the BamHI DNA. Most notably, the BstYI recognition sequence is unwound at the central step (RGATCY) but is overwound at the adjoining steps (RGA TCY). The extent of unwinding is less than the BglII DNA, as evidenced by comparison of the helical twist parameters at the two central base pairs (21° versus 15°), but has a similar effect of causing the orientation of these base pairs to be almost superimposed (Figure 3B). Interestingly, unwinding at the central step has also been described in EcoRV- and EcoRI-DNA complexes, but in these two cases, the two inner base pairs become unstacked and cause large kinks in the DNA axis (Kim et al., 1990; Winkler et al., 1993). Moreover, the unwinding in the EcoRV and EcoRI complexes continues to the adjoining steps, whereas the BstYI and BglII DNAs are overwound. The under- and overwinding in BstYI and BglII DNAs may stem from common enzyme-DNA contacts. In particular, the sugar-phosphate backbone of the inner and middle pyrimidines (AGATCT) in both DNAs is stabilized in part by hydrogen bonds with the main chain NH groups of residues (45 and 47 in BstYI and 38 and 40 in BglII) carried on a loop (loop C in BstYI and loop D in BglII) that tracks the major groove on the backside

In BglII, two extended loops (loops C and D) from each subunit enclose DNA in the binding cleft.

The 6 base pair DNA recognition sequences are shown at the bottom with the common four base pair core sequences highlighted in red.

of the DNA. This loop is missing in BamHI and there are no equivalent BamHI-DNA hydrogen bonds. Active Site Architecture Structural studies on restriction endonucleases have revealed a similar architecture for the active site, with residues in most endonucleases following the weak consensus sequence (Glu/Asp)-X9-20-(Glu/Asp/Ser)-X(Lys) (Galburt and Stoddard, 2002; Pingoud and Jeltsch, 2001). BamHI and BglII are the only exceptions to this consensus, containing a glutamate (Glu113) and a glutamine (Gln95) at the final position, respectively, instead of lysine (Lukacs et al., 2000; Newman et al., 1995). This difference is "real," as for example, changing Glu113 in BamHI to lysine or glutamine inactivates the enzyme (Dorner and Schildkraut, 1994). The BstYI structure reveals an active site that is more BglII-like than BamHIlike, with a glutamine at the final position (Asp119, Glu128, and Gln130). The BstYI catalytic triad is arranged around the scissile phosphate similar to the active sites of BamHI (Asp94, Glu111, and Glu113) and BglII (Asp84, Glu93, and Gln95) (Figure 4). There has been much debate as to the catalytic

mechanism of restriction endonucleases (Galburt and Stoddard, 2002). Crystal structures of the BamHI prereactive and postreactive complexes have been solved in the presence of Ca2+ and Mn2+, respectively, and suggest a two-metal mechanism of catalysis (Viadiu and Aggarwal, 1998) (Figure 4). In contrast, in the BglII cocrystal structure, only a single octahedrally coordinated Ca2+ ion is seen occupying the active site (Lukacs et al., 2000; Viadiu and Aggarwal, 1998). However, solution studies are still needed to confirm the structural interpretation of metal ion coordination by BamHI and BglII. No divalent cations were used in the crystallization of the BstYI complex, and we see no evidence of any ions occupying a potential Mg2+ binding site. There are, however, several conserved water molecules positioned within the active site that are likely to be displaced upon metal binding (Figure 4). In some restriction endonucleases, a fourth catalytic residue is required to stabilize the second metal ion (Galburt and Stoddard, 2002). Interestingly, the putative fourth catalytic residue in the BstYI active site appears to be a glutamate (Glu75), which may be functionally analogous to the Glu77 of BamHI. In BamHI, the side

To highlight the movement of the monomer subunits, the right subunit in the free dimers are shown in the same orientation as the right subunit in the complexes. Regions within the binding cleft and dimer interface that undergo local conformational changes are colored in yellow and magenta, respectively, and disordered regions are indicated as black dashed lines. The BstYI dimer incorporates elements of both BamHI-like (clamping) and BglII-like (scissor) motions, in which each subunit rotates around and perpendicular to the DNA axis. A disordered loop (loop C) in BstYI also becomes ordered upon DNA binding and the extended arm subdomain moves downwards by a rigid body movement.

chains of Glu77 and Asp94 coordinate a second metal in the active site, next to the scissile phosphate (Figure 4). Because BglII has a less acidic asparagine residue (Asn69) at the corresponding position, it is thought to be unable to coordinate a second metal in the active site, though more experimental data are needed to confirm this (Lukacs et al., 2000). In the BstYI-DNA structure, Glu75 is too distant to coordinate a metal ion in the active site (Figure 4). In the presence of metals, however, it is likely that this residue will move closer to the other active site residues, with the potential to coordinate a second metal ion, similar to BamHI. Therefore, until further structural and solution studies in the presence of Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions are performed, it remains uncertain whether the BstYI catalysis reaction proceeds with one or two metals.

DNA Recognition The BstYI recognition sequence (RGATCY) overlaps that of BamHI (GGATCC) and BglII (AGATCT). Thus, questions arise as to (1) how BstYI manages to recognize either a G:C or an A:T base pair at the outer position, and (2) whether BstYI recognizes the common inner and middle base pairs in a similar way as BamHI or BglII do. BamHI and BglII recognize the outer base pairs of their recognition sequences (GGATCC and AGATCT) by two equivalent residues located on the loop preceding the second dimerization helix (6 in BamHI, 5 in BglII). Specifically, residues Asp154 and Arg155 in BamHI and Asn140 and Ser141 in BglII recognize a G:C and an A:T base pair, respectively (Lukacs et al., 2000; Newman et al., 1995) (Figure 5). Based on the structure of free

The identity of the base pairs is shown on the left and the local twist parameters for each base pair step are highlighted on the right.

In the absence of metals, the BstYI-DNA structure reveals several water molecules in the putative Mg2+ binding sites.

The DNA recognition sequences are highlighted in yellow; with major and minor groove contacts indicated as red and blue lines, respectively. Contacts to the phosphate backbone (purple) are also displayed for BstYI (green). In the BstYI complex, only two residues (Ser172 and Lys133) mediate recognition of the core base pairs and, unlike BamHI and BglII, there is a direct contact to an adenine of a flanking A:T base pair, via Tyr115. (Bottom) Close-up view of protein-DNA contacts in one half-site of the recognition sequence. DNA bases are colored in yellow and water molecules are colored cyan. Hydrogen bonding is indicated by dashed lines (white). In the BstYI-DNA complex, Ser172 forms a hydrogen bond to the middle cytosine, identical to Asn140 in BglII and Asp154 in BamHI. However, Gly173 does not specify the outer base pair, like the equivalent residues in BglII (Ser141) and BamHI (Arg155). Instead, a cavity between the glycine and the nucleotide allows for watermediated recognition of N7 of the outer purine by a lysine (Lys133). This lysine residue also forms bidentate hydrogen bonds with the middle guanine and VDW contacts with the inner thymine.

BstYI, we previously speculated that Ser172 and Glyl73 in BstYI were positioned equivalently to Asp154 and Arg155 in BamHI and Asn140 and Ser141 in BglII for contacting the degenerate outer base pair (RGATCY) (Townson et al., 2004). Indeed, this is the case. Ser172 donates a single hydrogen bond to the O4 of outer thymine (AGATCT) in a similar way as Asn140 in BglII donates a single hydrogen bond to the outer thymine (AGATCT) and Asp154 in BamHI accepts a hydrogen bond from N4 of the outer cytosine (GGATCC). Furthermore, the main chain oxygen of Ser172 forms a hydrogen bond to the middle cytosine (AGATCT) in an identical manner as the main chain carbonyl of Asn140 in BglII and Asp154 in BamHI (Figure 5). On the other hand, Gly173 in BstYI has a much more distinctive role than Arg155 in BamHI and Ser141 in BglII. In BamHI,

Arg155 donates bidentate hydrogen bonds to the outer guanine (GGATCC), while Ser141 in BglII forms bidentate hydrogen bonds with the outer adenine (AGATCT). In BstYI, Gly173 does not directly specify the outer purine; for example, the distance between the main chain carbonyl of Gly173 and the N7 of the outer adenine (AGATCT) is >6 Å. Instead, a cavity between the glycine and the nucleotide allows for a water molecule that hydrogen bonds to the N7 of the outer purine. In turn, this water molecule also hydrogen bonds to a lysine (Lys133) located on another conserved loop (A). Thus, recognition of the outer purine is different from that observed with BamHI and BglII. The means by which BstYI recognizes the outer base pair can also be compared to the mechanism by which endonucleases HincII and BsoBI recognize a degenerate R:Y base pair. Both HincII and BsoBI spec-

ify the R through a purine-specific hydrogen bond to N7, and the Y through water-mediated contacts to the N4/O4 (Horton et al., 2002; van der Woerd et al., 2001). BstYI displays an opposite pattern: a direct hydrogen bond to the pyrimidine and water-mediated recognition of the purine (Figure 5). The inner and middle base pairs of the BstYI, BamHI, and BglII recognition sequences are identical (NGATCN). Thus, one might expect the recognition of these base pairs to be very similar between the three enzymes. Surprisingly, even BamHI and BglII, which contain a structurally equivalent asparagine near these base pairs (Asn116 in BamHI and Asn98 in BglII), interact differently with the inner and middle base pairs (Lukacs et al., 2000; Newman et al., 1995). In BstYI, the structurally equivalent residue to Asn116 in BamHI and Asn98 in BglII turns out to be a lysine (Lys133). Because of its length, Lys133 is able to extend between the middle and outer base pairs, making bidentate hydrogen bonds with the guanine of the middle base pair (RGATCY) and also bonding to the "outer" water molecule (described above) (Figure 5). Moreover, the nonpolar portion of Lys133 makes van der Waals (VDW) contacts with the methyl group of the thymine of the inner A:T base pair (RGATCY). Hence, Lys133 in BstYI specifies the inner and middle base pairs of the recognition sequence and contributes to the recognition of the outer base pair. Like Lys133, the nonpolar portions of Asn116 in BamHI and Asn98 in BglII also mediate similar VDW contacts with the inner thymine. Curiously, there are no direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the inner A:T base pair in the BstYI-DNA complex. In contrast, in the BamHI-DNA complex, the inner thymine is hydrogen bonded to Asn116, whereas the inner adenine is involved in a network of water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the enzyme (Newman et al., 1995). In the BglII-DNA complex, the inner adenine is instead hydrogen bonded to Ser97 (Lukacs et al., 2000). Part of the specificity for an inner A:T base pair in the BstYI recognition sequence may derive from "indirect readout," given the undertwisting at the central base pair step (RGATCY). Among Watson-Crick nearest neighbors, adjacent A:T base pairs are the least stable and presumably require the least free energy to unwind (Klug et al., 1979; SantaLucia and Hicks, 2004). BstYI also makes a base contact outside of the core RGATCY recognition sequence. A tyrosine residue (Tyr115) on strand 3 of the extended arm donates a single hydrogen bond to the N3 of a flanking adenine residue in the DNA minor groove (TTATAGATCTATAA) (Figure 5). An identical interaction is seen in the sequence flanking the other half-site. Thus, Tyr115 effectively "locks" the DNA duplex on either side of the binding cleft. Interestingly, analogous DNA contacts are not observed in either the BamHI or BglII complexes, wherein basespecific contacts are limited solely to the hexameric DNA recognition sequence (GGATCC or AGATCT, respectively). Discussion The BstYI recognition sequence overlaps with that of BamHI (GGATCC) and BglII (AGATCT). Correspondingly,

BstYI recognizes and cleaves both BamHI and BglII sites equally well and one might expect the structure of BstYI to be "intermediate" between BamHI and BglII. In fact, the BstYI/DNA complex emerges here as more BglII-like than BamHI-like with, for example, a DNA that is distorted by local unwinding and overwinding, a loop in the enzyme that wraps around to the back side of the DNA, and an active site that contains a glutamine at the final position of the consensus. At the same time, BstYI is unique in containing an extended arm subdomain that gives rise to an intertwined dimer, and the mechanism of DNA capture has both scissor-like (BglIIlike) and clamping (BamHI-like) elements. Also, BstYI does not directly contact the minor groove of its recognition sequence, and DNA recognition as a whole is much more minimal than BglII and BamHI. Only Ser172 and Lys133 partake in recognition of the core sequence (RGATCY), resulting in two water-mediated and eight direct base specific contacts for the dimeric enzyme (Figure 5). In contrast, almost every hydrogen bonding potential of the core base pairs is satisfied in the BamHI and BglII structures, culminating in an extensive network of over 20 base-specific contacts in both the minor and major grooves of the DNA (Figure 5). A key question in the study of restriction endonucleases is whether an existing scaffold can be modified to recognize a different, or even a closely related, DNA site. Guided by structure, a number of attempts have been made to alter the specificity of restriction endonucleases, but without much success. The recent application of a "directed evolution" method to select BstYI variants with activity toward only BglII (AGATCT) rather than the wild-type (RGATCY) recognition sequence has shown promise (Samuelson and Xu, 2002). By selecting BstYI mutants that inflict limited DNA damage in vivo in the presence of BglII methylation protection, two mutations (K133N and S172N) were identified as being important for partially altering the DNA specificity of BstYI to that of BglII. Moreover, a combined double mutant (K133N/S172N) displayed even greater selectivity, with a 12-fold preference for cleavage of the AGATCT sequence, as compared to cleavage of AGATCC, and with no detectable cleavage of the BamHI recognition sequence GGATCC. The BstYI structural analysis validates this genetic approach to identifying residues involved in DNA specificity, revealing Lys133 and Ser172 as essential for DNA recognition. Ser172 donates a single hydrogen bond to O4 of outer thymine, whereas Lys133 contributes to the recognition of all three base pairs in each BstYI recognition half-site. The fact that the BstYI complex is more similar to the BglII complex than to the BamHI complex is consistent with the selection of BstYI variants that prefer to cleave the BglII sequence (rather than the BamHI sequence). The BstYI complex will bolster efforts to isolate BstYI variants with increased specificity toward the BglII sequence. Interestingly, the S172N variant can be modeled with the asparagine donating a hydrogen bond to the O4 of the outer thymine (AGATCT) and making VDW contacts with its methyl group. However, the O1 of the asparagine is apposed unfavorably close to the carboxylate group of Glu46 and, based on the structure, it would be more favorable to replace Glu46 with a glutamine (as it occurs in BglII). However, even with the struc-

ture, it is unclear why the BstYI K133N genetic variant prefers to cleave the BglII sequence. One can speculate on the loss of the "outer" water molecule (bonded by Lys133), but this does not explain the preference for A over G at the outer purine position. Along the same lines, replacing Gly173 in BstYI by serine (as in BglII), in the context of the double mutant S172N/G173S, has been found to render the enzyme virtually inactive (Samuelson and Xu, 2002), even though the serine hydroxyl group can, in principle, substitute for the "outer" water molecule and specify an outer purine. Thus, although the BstYI complex can be used in combination with in vivo selection methods to alter the specificity of the enzyme, the structure also highlights the limitation in our current understanding of specificity. Consequently, crystal structures of BstYI S172N, K133N, and G173S genetic variants may be necessary for a fuller understanding of the perturbations in the BstYI-DNA interface at sites distant from the mutations. Even with these potential mutant structures, it is an open question as to how "completely" one can switch the specificity of BstYI to that of BglII. Although BstYI and BglII share a similar / fold, their DNA recognition strategies are surprisingly distinct, even for the common inner and middle base pairs (NGATCN). Whereas BglII positions an asparagine (Asn98) near these base pairs, BstYI contains a lysine (Lys133) that mediates a different set of protein-DNA contacts and extends up to the outer base pair. Thus, each enzyme appears to have evolved its own unique DNA recognition strategy, even though they recognize closely related or overlapping DNA sites. We have previously suggested that restriction enzymes may be under selective pressure not to look too much alike (Lukacs et al., 2001). For example, if the specificity of BamHI could be easily changed to that of BglII through just a few point mutations, it would be lethal for a host bacterium because it would become susceptible to cleavage at the unmethylated BglII sites on its genome. However, one can take some encouragement from the recent work on homing endonucleases. Similar to restriction enzymes, homing endonucleases recognize and cleave highly specific double-strand DNA sequences, requiring only Mg2+ for phosphodiester bond cleavage (Galburt and Stoddard, 2002). In one recent study, the LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease I-CreI was successfully altered at individual residues corresponding to contact points in the DNA target site, and the resultant enzymes were shown to have new specificities both in vivo and in vitro (Sussman et al., 2004). Whether similar results can be achieved with restriction endonucleases is debatable, although BstYI and BglII are ideal test cases. BstYI and BglII could not be any closer in terms of their recognition sequences. It will be interesting to see how far the specificity of these two closely related enzymes can be interchanged using the newly gained structural information.
Experimental Procedures Crystallization BstYI was overexpressed in an Escherichia coli T7 expression strain ER2744 (pACYC-BstYIM, pCEF8 [LysS], pET21at-BstYIR). The protein was purified by heat denaturation at 65°C to denature

E. coli proteins, followed by heparin-sepharose and DEAE sepharose chromatography, as previously reported (Samuelson and Xu, 2002). The protein was concentrated to 35 mg ml-1 in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 5 mM Me. A self-complementary 2#-tritylated oligomer 5#-TTATAGATCT ATAA-3# was purified by HPLC, dissolved to 10 mM in distilled water, and reannealed by heating to 95°C followed by slow-cooling to room temperature. The duplex was then concentrated to 10 mg ml-1. Before crystallization, protein at 35 mg ml-1 was incubated with a 1.5 M equivalent of duplex oligonucleotide at 4°C for 30 min. A 1 l drop of protein-DNA complex was combined with 1 l of precipitant (1.0 M sodium citrate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate [pH 6.5], and 1.5% 1,2,3 heptanetriol) and equilibrated at 20°C against 0.5 ml of the same solution in a hanging drop plate. Initial cocrystals grew at 20°C within a few weeks but were mosaic and did not diffract better than 3.5 Å. Microseeding the original cocrystals and growing them under the same conditions subsequently produced single well ordered crystals. These cocrystals grew at 20°C and diffracted cleanly to w3 Å on the home source (RAXIS IV). Recombinant selenomethionyl BstYI was expressed using E. coli ER2744 cells in media containing selenomethionine (SeMet) instead of methionine. Because ER2744 cells are not methionine auxotrophic, amino acids known to inhibit the methionine biosynthesis pathway were also included in the media, as described previously (Van Duyne et al., 1993). The protein was purified using the same protocol as described for the native protein and crystallized under identical conditions. Crystals were equilibrated at 20°C for several days before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection and Structure Determination A MAD experiment was performed on a SeMet crystal at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) on the Beamline X12C (Table 1). The crystal diffracted to 2.7 Å resolution and indexing with the HKL2000 package (Otwinowski, 1997) determined that it belonged to the space group C2, with cell dimensions a = 78.58 Å, b = 110.91 Å, c = 80.08 Å,  = 90°,  = 107.17°, and  = 90°, and one enzyme dimer bound to a DNA duplex in the asymmetric unit. The data were gathered at two wavelengths, corresponding to the peak of the selenium K edge absorption profile and a remote point, and processed with the HKL2000 package. The positions of all eight selenium atoms were located and subsequently refined and phased using CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). The initial phases (2.7 Å) were improved by density modification (Cowtan, 1994). The resulting electron density map was of readily interpretable quality and was used to build the initial model in O (Jones et al., 1991). Several cycles of simulated annealing, positional and B factor refinements, were performed in CNS. Two-fold noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging was applied to the monomer subunits (A and B), and both subunits have nearly identical conformations with an average root-mean-square deviation of 0.013 Å for all C atoms. The final structure contains residues 1­203 (subunits A and B), the 14-mer DNA duplex (subunits C and D), and 104 waters, with a crystallographic R factor of 23% (Rfree of 26.7%). The model has good stereochemistry, with 100% of the residues in the most favored and allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, and no residues in the disallowed regions (Laskowski et al., 1993). Structural Analysis Analysis of the stereochemical quality of the protein model and assignment of secondary structure were conducted with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). Protein-DNA contacts were calculated using LIGPLOT (Wallace et al., 1995). DNA parameters were analyzed using 3DNA (Lu and Olson, 2003) and CURVES (Lavery and Sklenar, 1988). Figures were prepared using MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996) and PYMOL (DeLano, 2003).
