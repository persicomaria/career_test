Abstract--The reaction of 1-chloro,l-chloromethyl,l-silacyclopentane and 1-chloro, lchloromethyl, l-silacyclohexane with magnesium turnings in THF yielded a mixture of bimolecular coupled dispiro compounds, namely 5,7-disila-dispiro[4.1.4.1]dodecane (IA) and 6,8-disila-dispiro[5.1.5.1]tetradecane (IB) and the trimolecular coupled products 5,7, 13-trisila-trispiro[4.1.4.1.4.1]octadecane (IIA) and 6,8,15-trisila-trispiro[5.1.5.1.5.1] heneicosane (liB). The solid state structures of the two trispiro compounds were determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis. The crystal structure of 6,8,15-trisila-trispiro [5.1.5.1.5.1]heneicosane is noteworthy in that there are three independent molecules found in the unit cell.

Organosilicon-spiro chemistry is a rapidly expanding area of research. 1 It has been demonstrated previously that the reverse Grignard procedure in THF: can be used as a general preparative route for the synthesis of several silicon-spiro linked 1,3disilacyclobutanes and 1,3,5-trisilacyclohexanes, 3 as shown in Scheme 1. As a continuation of our investigation into the chemistry of spirosilanes, we report herein the synthesis of two 1,3-disilacyclobutanes and two 1,3,5-trisilacyclohexanes prepared by this method, as well as the structural characterization of the two 1,3,5-trisilacyclohexanes, namely 5,7,13-trisila-trispiro[4.1.4.1.4.1]

octadecane (IIA) and 6,8,15-trisila-trispiro [5.1.5.1.5.1]heneicosane (liB). EXPERIMENTAL

Synthesis
THF was distilled from lithium aluminum hydride prior to use. Magnesium turnings were ground to 2 mm mesh prior to use. 1-Chloro,1chloromethyl, l-silacyclopentane and 1-chloro, 1chloromethyl, l-silacyclohexane were prepared by published procedures. 4 All reactions were carried out under an inert atmosphere of dinitrogen. Mass spectral data were recorded on a high resolution CEC-21-110B mass spectrometer (70 eV ionizing voltage).

Preparation of 5,7-disila-dispiro[4.1.4.1]dodecane (IA) and 5,7,13-trisila-trispiro[4.1.4.1.4. l]octadecane (IIA)
To a small amount of magnesium covered by T H F was added a few drops of l-chloro, l-chloromethyl-silacyclopentane. The reaction started with the application of heat and was evidenced by the subsequent exotherm. The remainder of the silane (13.24 g; 7.8 x 10 -2 mol) in sufficient T H F to bring the final silane concentration up to 33% was then added rapidly. The remaining magnesium (2.85 g; 1.7 x 10 -1 tool) was added gradually over a period of 2 h. After an additional 1.5 h of heating, the cooled solution was filtered to remove the precipitated magnesium salts, which were washed with hexane. The hexane washings were combined with the T H F filtrate and distilled until the bath temperature reached 120°C. The remaining liquid was transferred to a vacuum line, where 2.39 g [1.22 x 10 -2 mol (31%), m.p. 40-41°C] of IA was obtained by sublimation (M + at m/z = 196.1098, calc. for C10H2oSi2 : 196.1102). The remaining solid residue was sublimed at 1 m m at 85-90°C to yield 0.969 g [3.29 x 10 -3 mol (12.7%), m.p. 138-139°C] o f I I A (M + at m/z = 294.1637, calc. for C~5H30Si3 : 294.1647).

Preparation of 6, 8-disila-dispiro [5.1.5.1 ] tetradecane (IB) and 6,8,15-trisila-trispiro[5.1.5.1.5. l ]heneicosane (IIB)
The procedure outlined above was followed using 3.1 g of magnesium and 15.66 g of 1-chloro,1chloromethyl-silacyclohexane. After distillation, the remaining liquid was transferred to an evaporating dish and left to evaporate to dryness in air. The resulting solid residue was sublimed at 1 m m at 65°C yielding 5.4 g [0.024 mol (57%), m.p. 6567°C] of IB (M + at m/z = 224.1430, calc. for C12H24Si2: 224.1416). Vacuum distillation of the residue at 1 m m and 160°C yielded 0.14 g [4.25 x 10 -4 mol (1.5%), m.p. 85-87°C] of IIB at m/z = 336.2140, calc. for Ci8H36Si3 : 336.2125).

X-ray structural solution and refinement
Crystals of IIA and liB were obtained by vacuum sublimation (1 torr; 90 and 160°C, respectively). Colourless prismatic crystals were mounted at the end of glass fibres and covered with epoxy. Geometric and intensity data were taken on a CAD-4 diffractometer, using essentially routine procedures. After the initial determination of the unit cell for structure IIA, normal-beam oscillation

Synthesis of spiro cyclic siliconmethylene compounds photos were taken for the a- and c-axes, as well as for the direct lattice vector [210], in order to verify the lattice dimensions. An axial photo of the vector [ - 1,1,1] was used to verify the R-centring of the cell, prior to intensity data collection. For both crystals, three intensity-monitor reflections varied by only a fraction of 1% each in intensity during the course of data collection. Although absorption was not a great worry for these crystals, an empirical correction was applied, based on ~,-scans of seven reflections. After data reduction 5 the structures were solved by direct methods and developed and refined in the usual series of difference maps and least-squares refinements. Although m a n y of the hydrogen atoms could be seen in difference Fourier, all of them were initially placed at idealized positions and then

1547

treated as riding atoms, with the C - - H distances variable from one carbon atom to another. (The two hydrogen atoms attached to a given carbon were placed in such a way as to have the same C - - H distance.) In addition, the isotropic displacement parameter of each hydrogen atom was set to 1.2 times the equivalent isotropic displacement parameter of its parent carbon atom. For the refinement of complex IIA, the choice of R3c as space group, rather than the centric group R3c, was verified by successful refinement in the polar group, followed by verification that the coordinates and symmetry operators together do indeed define a polar structure. The determination of the enantiomorph, as expected, was slightly ambiguous. The Flack parameter 6 for the enantiomorph we report refined to a value of -0.30(34). This

can be compared to the value of 1.32(35) for the opposite enantiomorph. The value of Rw2 for the second enantiomorph was 0.114, as compared to a value of 0.109 for the enantiomorph that we report. For the remaining refinement, due to the unusual feature of an asymmetric unit containing three molecules (liB, IIB', IIB"), one extra test for higher symmetry was performed, beyond the normal axial photographs. At the end of refinement, a listing was made of the reflection data, including the observed and calculated structure factors, sorted by the length of the associated reciprocal-lattice vector. In cases of higher symmetry, this listing of the hemisphere of data would expose groupings (in this case, presumably triplets) of what would really be symmetry equivalent data. We did not observe any such grouping in the sorted listing for this structure. In the final refinement, 60 variable parameters were refined to 1027 data and one restraint (for the floating origin of the polar space group 7) and 568 variable parameters were refined to 5478 data for structures IIA and liB, respectively, giving the final residuals listed in Table 1. No significant features were seen on either final difference map. A selection of bond distances, bond and torsion angles is given in Tables 2-4. Atomic coordinates, thermal parameters, full list-

This work demonstrates the capacity of the reverse Grignard procedure (i.e. adding magnesium to the chlorosilane) to effectively prepare four- and six-membered silaspiro ring systems which exhibit silicon as the unique spiro atom and possess only methylene bridging units. As expected and indicated by the overall yields, bimolecular coupling to produce the dispiro 1,3-disilacyclobutane systems is the statistically favoured pathway. However, it is not exclusive and trimolecular coupling, although much less probable, does compete with the bimolecular mechanism. Crystals of compound IIB exhibited three independent molecules per asymmetric unit, while crystals of IIA exhibited only one. ORTEP 8 diagrams showing the solid state conformation and atom numbering schemes for IIA, IIB, IIB' and liB" are presented in Figs 1 and 2. Each molecule is characterized by a central 1,3,5-trisilacyclohexane ring with an average Si--C bond distance of 1.868(3)/~. For comparison, this value is midway between that found for two similar complexes, namely dispiro [5.1.5.1 ]tetradecane and tricyclo[6.4.0.0]dodecane, 9 which exhibit average Si--C ring bond distances of 1.889(2) and 1.854(3)/~, respectively. The average trisilacyclohexane ring Si--C distance for the four molecules (IIA, IIB, lIB', IIB") is virtually identical

Synthesis of spiro cyclic siliconmethylene compounds at 1.867, 1.865, 1.866 and 1.869 ~ , respectively. The average C - - S i - - C and S i - - C - - S i bond angles for these structures are 108.6(3) ° and 117.5(3) °, respectively. This deviates slightly from the two comparative structures, which report average C - - S i - - C and S i - - C - - S i bond angles of 112.0(3) ° and 114.4(3) °, respectively. These correspond to another similar structure, namely (Ph2SiCH2)3 ~° (Ph = C 6 H s ) , in which the average C - - S i - - C and S i - - C - - S i angles of 110.0 ° and 117.9 ° are very close to those presented here. The remaining CsSi rings exhibit little deviation from the expected C - - C bond distances and C - - C - - C bond angles. The m a x i m u m and minim u m C - - C bond distances found in the three independent molecules (IIB, IIB', liB") were 1.541(9) and 1.492(9)/~, with an average of 1.524(9)/~. The C - - C distances found in the C4Si rings of IIA were slightly less, with an average of 1.483(9) /~. All C - - C - - C bond angles for both the C4Si and CsSi rings fell within the limits of 115.2 ° and 112.2 ° . Average values for the S i - - C bond distances found in the C4Si and CsSi rings are 1.879(4) and 1.867(7), 1.867(7), and 1.869(7)/k for the three independent molecules of IIB. The corresponding average C - - S i - - C ring angles were found to be 94.9(3) ° and 103.3(3)', 102.4(3) °, and 102.7(3) ° for IIA, IIB, I I B ' and IIB". The smaller C - - S i - - C angle of molecule IIA is presumably due to the smaller ring size and decreased C - - C bond lengths. REFERENCES
