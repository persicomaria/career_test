Abstract The ribonuclease MC1 (RNase MC1) from seeds of bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) consists of 190 amino acid residues with four disulfide bridges and belongs to the RNase T2 family, including fungal RNases typified by RNase Rh from î Rhizopus niveus and RNase T2 from Aspergillus oryzae. The crystal structure of RNase MC1 has been determined at 1.75 A resolution with an R-factor of 19.7% using the single isomorphous replacement method. RNase MC1 structurally belongs to the (K+L) class of proteins, having ten helices (six K-helices and four 310 -helices) and eight L-strands. When the structures of RNase MC1 and RNase Rh are superposed, the close agreement between the K-carbon positions for the total structure is obvious: the root mean square deviations calculated only for structurally related 151 K-carbon atoms of RNase MC1 and î RNase Rh molecules was 1.76 A. Furthermore, the conformation of the catalytic residues His-46, Glu-105, and His-109 in RNase Rh can be easily superposed with that of the possible catalytic residues His-34, Glu-84, and His-88 in RNase MC1. This observation strongly indicates that RNase MC1 from a plant origin catalyzes RNA degradation in a similar manner as fungal RNases. ß 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Since McClure et al. discovered that the S-glycoproteins associated with gametophytic self-incompatibility in the Solanaceae has ribonuclease activity [1], there has been growing evidence that RNases in plants, as the cases for RNases in mammals [2], may participate in diverse physiological and developmental processes (for a review see [3]). A large number of sequence information on plant RNases have

become available to date; it has been shown that their amino acid sequences are mutually related. On the basis of sequence homology, the plant RNases have been found to be related to RNases classi¢ed in the RNase T2 family typi¢ed by fungal RNases, such as RNase T2 [4], RNase M [5], and RNase Rh [6]. Furthermore, the plant RNases are subgrouped into two groups S-RNase and S-like RNase; the former includes RNases involved in the gametophytic self-incompatibility and the latter includes RNases not involved in it. However, despite the vast amount of sequence information, very few studies on the tertiary structure of plant RNases have been carried out thus far.

The 2P,3P-cyclizing RNases have been studied in mammalian as well as microbial cells for many years and classi¢ed into three distinct groups; RNase A, RNase T1 , and RNase T2 families, according to their molecular weights and amino acid sequences. The best characterized protein of the RNase T2 family is RNase Rh from Rhizopus niveus. The three-dimenî sional structure was determined at 2.0 A resolution [7] and the amino acid residues involved in the catalytic reaction and the substrate binding are well de¢ned by site-directed mutagenesis ([8] and references therein). Moreover, on the release of nucleotides from RNA, RNase Rh was identi¢ed to have nonabsolute base speci¢city. However they release the four nucleotides in the order of A s G s U,C [9]. Thus, the fungal RNases grouped in the RNase T2 family can be distinguished from other RNase families by their non-base speci¢city. RNase MC1, isolated from the bitter gourd seeds, consists of a single polypeptide chain of 190 amino acids, having four disul¢de bridges [10]. Sequence comparison of RNase MC1 with other known plant RNases revealed that RNase MC1 has a signi¢cant homology with S-like RNases (42%), and a slightly lower homology with S-RNases (40%). In addition, RNase MC1 shares the two stretches of amino acid sequences around the two active site histidine residues in fungal non-base-speci¢c RNases. However, in spite of sequence homology, RNase MC1 has been revealed to preferentially cleave the phosphodiester bond of the NpU (where N is either A, G, U, or C) [11]. This absolute uracil speci¢city found for RNase MC1 is quite di¡erent from that of fungal RNases, which preferentially cleave RNA at adenylic acid residues, but without absolute base speci¢city. Moreover, the speci¢city of RNase MC1 set by the uracil at the 3P-terminal side of dinucleotide monophosphates is distinct from other RNases, including those in RNase A and RNase T1 families. It is generally known that RNases degrade the phosphodiester bond, primarily recognizing the base located at the 5P-side of the scissile bond, though the dependence of the catalytic rate on the nature of the nucleoside at the 3P-side of the scissile bond is known to be a general feature of RNases. It is thus speculated that RNase MC1 might have diverged from the archetype of fungal non-base-speci¢c RNases, acquiring a subsite structure capable to bind to the uracil

base at the 3P-side of the scissile bond. To obtain a fuller understanding of the enzymatic mechanism of RNase MC1, it was thought to be essential that its tertiary structure be determined at the atomic resolution. De and Funatsu crystallized RNase MC1 for X-ray studies some years ago [12]. In the present study, we determined the crystal structure of RNase MC1 by the single isomorphous replacement method. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Preparation of the RNase MC1 crystal. RNase MC1 was prepared from the seeds of bitter gourd and crystallized as previously described in [10,12]. The crystals are orthorhombic space group P21 21 21 with cell dimensions a = 67.69, b = 75.42, and î c = 38.76 A, containing one RNase MC1 molecule per asymmetric unit. The heavy atom derivative was prepared by soaking the crystals in solution containing 2 mM of p-hydroxymercuricbenzenesulfonic acid dissolved in the mother liquor. The soaking time was 2 days. 2.2. Data collection and computing. All di¡raction data were collected using CuKK radiation from a MAC science M18X rotation anode î (40 kV, 80 mA) with double focusing mirrors. Data were collected on a MAC science DIP-2000k di¡ractometer with 1.0³ rotation per frame. All data were integrated using the programs DENZO [13]. Scaling and merging were performed using the program SCALA [14] and other programs in the CCP4 suite [15]. The intensities were reduced to structure factors and scaled relative to each other using the programs in the CCP4 program suite [15]. Results of data reduction are summarized in Table 1. Further calculations for crystallography were mainly performed using the programs in the CCP4 program suite [15]. Two mercury atom sites were found from the anomalous di¡erence Patterson map using SHELXS-97 [16]. Heavy atom parameter re¢nement and phase calculation were carried out using the maximum likelihood approach with the program SHARP [17]. The atomic model was built using the program O [18] and was re¢ned by the program X-PLOR [19].

2.3. Structure determination and re¢nement Re¢nement of heavy atom parameters and phasing î was done with the di¡raction data below 2.0 A resî olution. The electron density map calculated at 1.9 A resolution obtained after phase extension and phase improvement by the program SOLOMON [20] gave extremely good electron density map (Fig. 1) in spite of poor anomalous signal. The results of phasing calculations are summarized in Table 2. All residues were built into the initial electron density map without ambiguity. Seventy-three water molecules were also identi¢ed in the initial map, and they were included in the initial model for re¢nement. The crystallographic R-factor for the data between 8 to 1.75 î A resolution dropped from 0.371 to 0.215 after the ¢rst ¢ve iterative cycles of positional and B-factor re¢nement. At the ¢nal stage of re¢nement, the model has an R-factor of 19.7% for 95% of the data î î between 10.0 A and 1.75 A resolution, including 190 residues and 25 water molecules, a total of 1145 atoms. Bulk solvent correction was applied. The free R-factor [21] for the remaining 5% of the data within this resolution range is 24.9%. The Ramachandran plot of the model shows that 87.7% of the residues lie within the most favored region and the remaining 12.3% of the residues lie within the additional allowed region. The root mean square deviations from standard values [22] of bond lengths î and angles are 0.005 A and 1.246³, respectively. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession code 1BK7.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Structure description Fig. 2 shows a ribbon diagram of the K-carbon tracing of RNase MC1. Dimension of the RNase î MC1 molecule is approximately 50U40U35 A, and structurally belongs to the (K+L) class of proteins, having ten helices (six K-helices and four 310 -helices) and eight L-strands. The amino acid residues (L1: 3^ 9, and L2: 32^40) at the N-terminal region form a two-stranded antiparallel L-sheet, intervening one Khelix (K1; 11^16) and one 310 -helix (K2: 24^27) structures which are held together by the ¢rst disul¢de bridge between residues 15 and 23. The polypeptide chain enters the extended helical structure, having a short L-strand (L3: 43^44), followed by K-helices (K3: 55^61 (310 ), K4: 62^68, K5: 77^87, K6: 89^92 (310 ), K7: 98^111, K8: 114^118, K9: 119^121 (310 ) and K10: 132^143) and one strand L4: 129^131, connected through a series of loops. The amino acid residues at the C-terminal region form an antiparallel pleated L-sheet (L5: 148^153, L6: 160^170, and L7: 176^177), forming a central antiparallel pleated Lsheet with the N-terminal L-strands (L1^L3). The structure is completed by two antiparallel L-strands (L4: 129^131 and L8: 187^189) followed by a stretch of extended polypeptide chain. The amino acid sequence of RNase MC1 was initially determined by the protein chemical methods [10]. Recently, the cDNA encoding RNase MC1

Gln-50 as identi¢ed by protein sequencing was missing in the sequence deduced from the cDNA. The present crystal structure perfectly matches the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence. It thus results in that RNase MC1 is composed of 190 amino acid residues with a calculated Mr of 21, 222. The recent analysis by the protein chemical method determined the connection scheme of four disul¢de bridges in RNase MC1 as follows: Cys-15 to Cys-23, Cys-48 to Cys-91, Cys-168 to Cys-179, and Cys-151 to Cys-184 (G. Funatsu, unpublished results), which is in full agreement with that determined by the crystal structure of RNase MC1. 3.2. Structure comparison The three-dimensional structure of RNase MC1 molecule was compared to the RNase Rh molecule, the structure of which has been described in detail [7]. Fig. 3 is the superposition of the backbones of the RNase MC1 and RNase Rh molecules. Two structures are very similar, even with the sequence di¡erence in the residues (26% identity). The root mean square deviation, calculated only for structurally related 151 K-carbon atoms of RNase MC1 and RNase Rh molecules of which K-carbons were closer î î than 3.8 A, was 1.760 A as calculated by the 1sqimprove command in O [18]. The two molecules also possess the same elements of secondary structure, as shown in Fig. 4, which displays the amino acid sequence alignment of the two proteins and the ele-

ments of secondary structure observed from the crystallographic models. The di¡erences in the K-carbon tracings mainly occur due to di¡erences in the length of the two polypeptide chains. One insertion found at the Nterminal region in RNase MC1 forms K-helix turn 310 -helix structure possibly stabilized by the disul¢de bridge (Cys-15 to Cys-23) between two-stranded (L1 and L2) structures. Since these two cysteine residues are absent in RNase Rh, but are completely conserved in plant RNases [3], the N-terminal region of plant RNases might fold into a conformation similar to that of RNase MC1. The N-terminal extension, which occurs only in RNase Rh, forms a closed loop that is held together by two disul¢de bridges (Cys-3 to Cys-20 and Cys-10 to Cys-53). This structure is completely missing in the RNase MC1. The other extra residues at the N-terminal (pos. 66^73) and middle region (pos. 118^128) of RNase Rh adopt short and extended loop structures, respectively. Deletion of these residues in RNase MC1 results in the shortened loop structure between two helices K6 and K7, as compared to RNase Rh. Sequence comparison of plant RNases found ¢ve highly conserved regions designated C1^C5 and two hypervariable regions designated HVa and HVb [3]. The conserved regions correspond to Phe-1-Pro-11 (C1), Thr-30-Pro-38 (C2), Lys-87-Ser-92 (C3), Met108-Ile-115 (C4), and Tyr-161-Phe-169 (C5) in RNase MC1. Examining the RNase MC1 structure, the regions C1^C5 are found to adopt secondary

structures, L1, L2, K5, K7, and L6, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3. This observation suggests that the structure found in this RNase MC1 is principally common to all plant RNases. On the other hand, the hypervariable regions HVa and HVb are located on the extended loop structures between L3 and K3, and K4 and K5, respectively, which are located on the external surface of RNase MC1. Since it is described that the HV regions in S-RNases are involved in pollen recognition [23], the S-RNases may have acquired a variety of amino acids in these regions and display their allele-speci¢c information on the molecular surface. 3.3. Possible active site The active site of RNase Rh has been mapped from the site-directed mutagenesis experiments [8]. The key active site residues include His-46, His-104, Glu-105, Lys-108, and His-109 involved in catalysis, and Trp-49, Asp-51, and Tyr-57 involved in binding the target base. The sequence alignment readily shows their equivalent residues in RNase MC1, as

shown in Fig. 4. All catalytic residues in RNase Rh are completely conserved in the primary structure of RNase MC1 as His-34, His-83, Glu-84, Lys-87, and His-88, while Asp-51 and Tyr-57 in RNase Rh are replaced by Gln-39 and Ser-44 in RNase MC1. Our recent study by the site-directed mutagenesis of RNase MC1 shows that the mutants, in which His34 or His-88 are replaced by the Ala residue, are virtually inactive (Kimura et al., unpublished results). It is therefore likely that His-34 and His-88 in RNase MC1 serve as the catalytic acid and catalytic base, respectively in the transphosphorylation reaction, as the catalytic His-46 and His-109 pair do in RNase Rh [24]. It is known that RNases have two distinct binding sites: the primary site and subsite, for the bases located at 5P- and 3P-terminal ends of the scissile bond, respectively. Base speci¢city is usually attributable to the nature of the interaction of the primary site with the base located at the 5P-terminal end [25]. As for RNase Rh, Trp-49, Asp-51, and Tyr-57 are assigned as building blocks to constitute the primary site. The Trp-49 is conserved in RNase MC1 (Trp-37) and two

259

residues appear to adopt an identical conformation, whereas Asp-51 and Tyr-57 are replaced by Gln-39 and Ser-44, respectively, in RNase MC1. In particular, the replacement of Tyr-57 in RNase Rh with Ser44 in RNase MC1 results in the lack of a hydrophobic pocket, which is involved in the purine recognition site (B1 -site) for RNase Rh. As described in Section 1, RNase MC1 is distinct from RNase Rh in that it preferentially cleaves the phosphodiester bond NpU, recognizing the uracil at the 3P-terminal side of the scissile bond. It is thus assumed that the lack of rigid base speci¢city at the 5P-terminal end for RNase MC1 may be due to these substitutions. Obviously, understanding the molecular basis for the uracil speci¢city at the 3P-terminal end for RNase MC1 will require structural studies of the crystal structure of RNase MC1 complexed with suitable nucleic acid fragments. The present crystal structure of RNase MC1 allows us to commence these studies. Acknowledgements We thank Prof. K.T.
