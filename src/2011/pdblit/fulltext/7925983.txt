Abstract Sequence of a tick gut lysozyme (TGL) from the soft tick Ornithodoros moubata was determined by cloning and sequencing of overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and RACE PCR products. It is the first lysozyme sequence representing the subphylum Chelicerata. The resulting open reading frame codes for a putative signal peptide of 22 amino-acid residues and a mature protein composed of 124 amino-acids. Calculated mass of the protein is 14037.75 Da and a theoretical isoelectric point is 8.16. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the TGL belongs to the c-type lysozymes. It forms a distinct monophyletic group together with multiple lysozyme-like sequences found in the gene products agCP6542 from Anopheles gambiae strain PEST and CG8492-PA from Drosophila melanogaster. This group is referred to as an H-branch due to a unique histidine residue at position 52 which replaces the highly conserved tyrosine present in the vast majority of c-type lysozymes. TGL seems to be an interesting case in which the features of lysozymes with anti-bacterial and digestive function are combined. Semiquantitative RT-PCR and Northern blotting analysis demonstrated that TGL is strongly up-regulated at the transcriptional level after a bloodmeal. The maximum lysozyme mRNA level was detected 16 h post bloodmeal and the message remained stable for 5 days and then it slowly dropped down to the level of non-fed ticks within 2 weeks. q 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Tick gut does not contain extracellular proteolytic enzymes and serves mainly as a major storage organ of a bloodmeal. Digestion is intracellular, taking place within the gut epithelium cells [1]. The protein-rich nutrient is only gradually absorbed and the digestion takes several months [2]. In order to avoid bacterial growth and decomposition of the ingested blood by multiplying bacteria, ticks have to possess an efficient protective mechanism within their gut. Up to this date,

only two antibacterial molecules have been shown to play the defense role in the tick gut. Four isoforms of defensin have been identified in the soft tick Ornithodoros moubata and their expression in the midgut was reported to be up-regulated in response to blood-feeding [3,4]. In our lab, we isolated and characterized a lysozyme from the gut contents of this species [5]. Lysozyme hydrolyses the 1,4-b-glycosidic bound between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine in cell wall peptidoglycans of Gram-positive bacteria. The bacteriolytic function of lysozyme is widely employed, in the innate immunity, in both animal and plant kingdoms and this enzyme is probably the most comprehensively studied defense molecule [6]. Recently, it was demonstrated that the antibacterial activity of lysozyme is independent of its muramidase activity [7]. The known lysozymes are grouped into several types. Within the animal phyla, three main lysozyme types are recognized: chickentype (c), goose-type (g), and invertebrate type (i). Lysozyme occurs widely in the cells and secretory fluids of vertebrates, where it may function as a bactericidal agent or help to dispose bacteria after they have been killed by other means. In the stomach of ruminants, the function of lysozyme was adapted to digest ingested bacteria which provide nitrogen and phosphorus necessary for milk production [8,9]. A similar adaptation of lysozyme to the digestive function has been reported for langur ruminant monkeys [10], leaf-eating bird-- hoatzin [11] and also for lysozymes from the midgut of flies Drosophila melanogaster [12,13] and Musca domestica [14,15]. In general, digestive lysozymes are of the c-type [16], however, they differ from nondigestive enzymes in several features: lower number of basic amino-acids (low pI values), resistance to proteases present in the alimentary tract (like pepsin in the stomach of vertebrates or cathepsin D in the insect midgut), pH-optimum in acidic range, etc. The role of the serine residue at position 98 (counted for Drosophila mature lysozyme D) for digestive function is also considered [13]. The biochemical characteristics of tick gut lysozyme (TGL) indicated to some extent that this enzyme may be adapted to a digestive function [5]. The Nterminal amino acid sequence of this protein (K-V-YD-R-C-S-L-A-S-E-L-R) had the closest relation to

the lysozymes from digestive tract of vertebrates; the motif DRCSLA was found to be specific for the whole family of Drosophila digestive lysozymes [17] and the pH optimum of tick lysozyme was in the range 5 ­ 7. On the other hand, the tick gut lysozyme had a high pI near 9.7 and it was only moderately thermostable. Hence, knowledge of the complete TGL sequence, and its phylogenetic relationships are necessary to answer the questions of how closely is this enzyme related to digestive lysozymes, and to which lysozyme type it belongs. The other problem addressed in this work is how lysozyme levels are regulated by a bloodmeal. We observed roughly a four-fold increase of lysozyme activity in the gut contents of adult O. moubata during the first day post bloodmeal (PBM) and the activity remained at the same level for a month [5]. In order to better understand the post-feeding lysozyme regulation, we determined the level of lysozyme mRNA by the method of semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Nothern-blotting.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Animals The nymphs and adult ticks were kept separately in polyethylene cages in a room conditioned to 25 ­ 27 8C and 80 ­90% relative humidity. They were fed artificially through the Parafilme membrane on prewarmed (40 8C) whole citrated bovine blood supplemented with 1:100 antibiotics-antimycotic solution (Sigma A9909) until repletion. Fed ticks were washed to remove any excess blood, dried on filter paper until coxal fluid excretion was completed and further kept as described above. 2.2. Collecting the gut tissues Guts were dissected from fed and non-fed adult ticks at increasing intervals of time following bloodmeal. The posterior cuticle was excised with fine scissors. Mild dorsoventral pressure on the tick body was applied to remove contents from the gut. The gut was collected with a fine pair of forceps and washed in excess of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The tissue was immediately transferred into a micro-tube

653

containing RNAlatere solution (Ambion, cat. no. 7020), and kept on ice during the dissection. Guts from 10 individual ticks were collected for each time point. 2.3. Isolation of the total RNA The gut tissue was homogenized in TRI Reagentw (Sigma, cat. no. T 9424, 1 ml per 50 ­100 mg of wet tissue) using a plastic pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min at 4 8C, to remove insoluble material. The supernatant containing RNA was transferred to a fresh tube and further RNA isolation was undertaken according to the TRI Reagentw protocol provided by the manufacturer. The final pellets of isolated RNA samples were stored in 70% ethanol at 2 80 8C until used. 2.4. PCR amplification of lysozyme fragments Total RNA (1 ­ 5 mg) isolated from the gut tissues of non-fed ticks was used for the preparation of first strand cDNA using Superscripte -II reverse transcriptase (Gibco BRLw, cat. no. 18064-022) and oligonucleotide (T)17 as a primer according to the provided protocol. One microliter of the resulting cDNA was used as a template for the following PCR amplifications. The first lysozyme gene fragment was obtained by PCR amplification using a degenerate sense primer S1: 50 AAGGTCTA(C/T)GAC(A/C)GTTG(C/T)TCCCTGGC 30 derived from the known N-terminal amino-acid sequence (KVYDRCSLA). Two variants of degenerate anti-sense primers AS1: 50 -(C/T)(T/G)CCA(A/T)GCCACCCATGC30 and AS2:50 -TA(C/G)T(T/G)CCA(T/G)GTGGACCA(A/G)GC were designed from two highly conserved motifs AWVAW(R/K) and AWSTW(H/K)Y which occur in the C-terminal part of vertebrate and Drosophila digestive lysozymes, respectively. The thermal cycler MasterGradient (Eppendorf) was programmed as follows: 94 8C--5 min, (94 8C--1 min; 52 8C-- 1 min; 72 8C--1 min) 30 cycles and 72 8C--7 min. Recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (Gibco BRLw, cat. no 10342) was used. A PCR product of 320 bp was obtained using the anti-sense primer AS1. The product was isolated from the agarose gel, cloned and sequenced as described below. The 30 - part of the TGL gene was PCR amplified by using a 30 RACE system (rapid amplification of cDNA

ends) of Gibco BRLw (cat. no. 18373-019). The first strand cDNA was prepared as above using a 30 RACE adapter primer 50 -GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC (T) 17-30 . The specific fragment of 440 bp was obtained by PCR amplification using a TGL genespecific sense primer (S2) derived from the 320 bp product 50 -ATTGCTGATTGGGTGTGC-30 and the Gibco BRLw universal amplification primer (UAP) 50 -GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-30 . PCR conditions were as above except for annealing at 60 8C, the reaction run for the first five cycles with the sense primer only and then the UAP was added and the amplification continued for another 30 cycles. The 50 -part of the lysozyme gene was obtained using the Takara 50 Full RACE Core Set (Takara, cat. no. 6122) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, reverse transcription was performed using a gene-specific anti-sense primer phosphorylated at the 50 -end: 50 -(P) CCTCCAATGGGTTG-30 and the resulting cDNA was circularized by the T4 RNA ligase (provided in the kit) and used as a template for PCR amplification. The unknown 50 -end region was amplified in two subsequent PCR reactions using two pairs of nested sense and anti-sense primers 50 S1: 50 -GCGCTGCGGGATGACAAC-30 ; 50 AS1: 50 -GCGATGCACACCCAATAAGC-30 and 50 S2: 50 -CAGGCATGGCTTCAGTG-30 ; 50 AS2: 50 TTT GGT CCT TGG GTAGTATGTA-30 . The PCR products of 390 and 310 bp were obtained using the first and the second pair of primers, respectively. T he reaction conditions were as above, annealing at 56 8C, 30 cycles. 2.5. DNA cloning and sequencing The obtained PCR products were isolated from agarose gel using a Sephaglas BandPrep kit (Amersham Biosciences, cat. no 27-9285-01) and cloned into pCRw 2.1-TOPOw vector of a TOPO TA Cloningw kit (Invitrogen, cat. no. K4500-01). The inserts were sequenced in both directions using the M13 Reverse or M13 Forward (2 20) primers (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing was performed using an automated sequencer model ABI Prism 310 (Perkin ­ Elmer) and the BigDyee DNA sequencing kit (PE-Biosystems, cat.no. 4303152) at the Institute of Entomology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech  ´  Republic, Ceske Budejovice. At least three different

654

clones of each overlapping lysozyme fragment were sequenced to assure high fidelity of the obtained sequence data. 2.6. Phylogenetic analysis The O. moubata lysozyme was analyzed together with 27 sequences retrieved from the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD, USA. They covered vertebrate stomach forms of lysozyme and invertebrate digestive lysozymes; gene for canine a-lactalbumin was used as an outgroup. The sequences were aligned in ClustalX using an array of parameters. Three different kinds of matrices were designed, an amino acid matrix, a nucleotide matrix, and a combined matrix. Since all the alignments, regardless the parameters, contained obvious errors, we prepared a final alignment by manual adjustment using BioEdit program [18] based on lysozyme alignments obtained from www pages of Pfam (http://pfam.wustl.edu) and Smart (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de) databases. To evaluate influence of ambiguously aligned regions, we analyzed two types of data: (1) complete matrices and (2) conservative regions only, which could be unambiguously aligned. Parsimony analyses of the matrices were performed in PAUP [19]. For each matrix the TBR algorithm with 50 replications of random sequence input was used. Bootstrap values were calculated for complete matrices by 1000 replications. 2.7. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR The semi-quantitative analysis of differences in lysozyme gene expression was performed by one-step RT-PCR reaction using the Enhanced Avian RT-PCR Kit of Sigma (cat. no. RT-PCR-20) according to the protocol provided. The ethanol was removed from the stored samples of RNA, the pellet was air-dried and RNA was dissolved in 50 ml of RNAse-free water. Two microliters aliquot was diluted by addition of 98 ml of RNAse-free water and used for spectrophotometrical determination of RNA concentration by reading the absorbance at 260 nm and using the formula 1 A ¼ 40 mg/ml RNA. Only the RNA samples with

purity ensured by the ratio A260 =A280 $ 1:7 were taken for further analysis. For semi-quantitative PCR a new pair of lysozyme gene-specific PCR primers were designed; sense S3: 5 0 -GTTGGGCAAAAGCACAGTCT-30 and anti-sense AS3: 50 -GAAAAGGGCGAGGGCATCAT-3 0 . The resulting product of 494 bp (comprising the complete coding sequence) was cloned and its sequence was determined as above. The RT-PCR reaction was performed using a fixed number of 30 cycles and annealing temperature of 56 8C. At first, pilot experiments with different dilution of total RNA were performed to determine the optimum starting amount of total RNA to achieve a linear response of the resulting product. 2.8. Northern blotting Prior to electrophoresis, RNA concentration was determined and adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml; 5 mg of each sample was loaded on the RNAse-free agarose gel. RNA gel electrophoresis and electrotransfer onto ZETA-Probe GT membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using the Genie electrophoretic blotter (Idea Scientific) was performed according to the protocol of Kevil et al. [20]. Transfer efficiency was determined by examining the agarose gel and nylon membrane under UV-light. The 0.24 ­ 9.5 kb RNA ladder (Gibco BRLw, cat. no. 15620-016) was used for RNA sizing. The probe was prepared by cutting the 494 bp insert from the pCRw 2.1-TOPOw plasmid DNA, followed by agarose electrophoresis and Sephaglase purification. DNA was random-primed labeled with [a-32P] dATP using a Decalabele DNA Labeling kit (MBIFermentas, cat. no. K0622) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The hybridization was performed at 55 8C overnight and further processed as recommended [20]. For documentation and analysis of electrophoretic gels, membranes and autoradiographs, a Kodak EDAS 290 system consisting of DC290 Digital Camera and 1D image analysis software (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY, USA) was used.

Fig. 1. Scheme of overlapping PCR products cloned and sequenced for determination of the tick gut lysozyme cDNA sequence. For abbreviations and sequences of the PCR primers see Section 2. All clones were sequenced at least three times from both sides using M13-forward and M13-reverse sequencing primers.

At first, a PCR product of 320 bp, specific for tick lysozyme, was obtained using degenerate primers designed according to the known N-terminal aminoacid sequence and a conserved motif AWVAW(R/K) found in the C-terminal portion of vertebrate c-type lysozymes. No product was amplified using the second version of the anti-sense primer derived from the AWSTW(H/K)Y sequence typical for the family of Drosophila digestive lysozymes. Second, the Cterminal fragment of 420 bp including the 30 -untranslated region (UTR) was amplified using a lysozyme gene specific primer (sense) and a universal amplifying primer anchoring to the polyadenylation signal. The N-terminal portion, signal sequence and 50 -UTR were determined by sequencing the 390 and/or 310 bp products resulting from the use of 50 -RACE method using the circular cDNA as a template. In order to ensure the correctness of the sequence, especially in the regions of the PCR primers, the fragment of 494 bp spanning across the entire coding part of the gene was cloned and sequenced (Fig. 1). The resulting cDNA sequence of tick gut lysozyme is 609 bp long and contains an ORF which codes for two closely adjacent methionins at positions -26 and -22 related to the N-terminus of the mature protein (see the GenBank AF425264). According to the translation rules described by Kozak [21], the AUG codon for the starting methionin should have an adenin at position 2 3 and a guanin at position þ 4 which is the case for the second methionin in the ORF. In addition to this, multiple alignment of known lysozyme signal sequences (data not shown) would favor the second methionin as the starting one. Thus we suppose that the putative signal sequence of TGL precursor

comprises the following 22 amino-acid residues: MLGKSTVLLVATIFAVGCVVEG. The deduced amino-acid sequence of tick lysozyme N-terminus was identical with that determined by Edman degradation [5] including the unique serine S10 of the mature protein which confirmed that the molecule cloned is identical with the lysozyme isolated from gut contents. The sequence of the conserved motif in the C-terminal part (used for designing of degenerate anti-sense primer of inner 320 bp fragment) was confirmed to be AWVAWK. The mature tick gut lysozyme (KVYDR...AGCKI) is composed of 124 amino-acid residues and it has a theoretical mass 14037.75 Da and an isolectric point of 8.16 as calculated by ExPASy Compute pI/Mw tool (http:// us.expasy.org/cgi-bin/pi_tool). The pI of native TGL determined experimentally by isoelectric focusing was much higher pI . 9.7 [5]. Thus TGL apparently does not share one of the main features characteristic for digestive lysozymes, namely their adaptation for an acidic environment (pH-optimum and low isoelectric point) [12,13,15]. Most digestive lysozymes have a low pI due to the reduced number of their basic amino acids; e.g. digestive lysozymes type D from fruit fly or lysozyme from house fly have only 9 and 10 basic residues, respectively [13,15]. In comparison, TGL possesses 17 basic (Lys, Arg) and 15 acidic (Asp, Glu) residues. From the difference between the theoretical and experimental pI value of TGL it is possible to judge that the basic residues are more exposed to the external solvent. A BLAST search in the GenBank database and a multiple alignment of selected mature lysozymes (Fig. 2) revealed that the tick gut lysozyme is of the c-type [16,22]. It possesses all of the 8 conserved cysteine residues and two major residues responsible for the catalytic activity of c-type lysozymes: glutamate E33 and aspartate D51 (numbered according to the mature TGL). In addition, the TGL contains all of the three conserved aspartate residues, D81, D86 and D87, involved in Ca2þ binding in alactalbumins [23]. The most striking difference in the TGL sequence is the presence of histidine H52, which replaces the highly conserved tyrosine found in the vast majority of c-type lysozymes at this position (Fig. 2). The same substitution was found in the gene products agCP6542 from Anopheles gambiae strain PEST (GenBank EAA11630) and

The BLAST search and the sequence distance table derived from the multiple alignment shown in Fig. 2 indicated that the TGL displays the highest similarity to the majority of these lysozyme-like sequences of the Anopheles and Drosophila `multi-lysozymes' (except for their C-terminal parts).

The presence of serine residue at position 98 in Drosophila lysozyme D (position 96 in TGL) and other digestive lysozymes is another feature assumed to be typical for adaptation to acidic environment and/or resistance to proteolytical cleavage [13]. Residue at this position is not highly conserved among non-digestive lysozymes; in TGL, the serine is replaced by alanine A96. In general, lysozymes in their native states are supposed to be quite resistant to proteolysis. To our knowledge, the limited proteolysis of lysozyme was studied with thermolysin using partially denatured chicken lysozyme in 50% aqueous trifluoroethanol. Under these conditions, the chicken lysozyme was cleaved at the position between Lys 97-Ile 98 [24], the residues common among non-digestive lysozymes including the TGL (positions 93 ­94, Fig. 2). The multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the TGL is more related to the family of the Drosophila digestive lysozymes than to other ctype lysozymes which do not have the digestive function. Nevertheless, the lysozyme sequences contain several regions, which are difficult to align. We suppose that convincing alignment is not feasible without considering tertiary structure and functional constraints (this difficulty is well demonstrated by several differences in lysozyme alignments retrieved from the two different databases). Since the relevant data are not currently available for most of the proteins, we presume that the final matrices are likely to contain misalignments. However, they do not affect the overall phylogenetic information: identical overall topologies were obtained by all analyses, and the key groups are well supported (Fig. 3). In all phylogenetic analyses performed (based on amino-acid, nucleotide and/or combined matrix), the gut lysozyme of O. moubata clustered together with the sequences derived from Anopheles and Drosophila multilysozyme gene products (Fig. 3). Due to the presence of histidine H52 (with the exception of AngamPESTGP1), we further refer this branch as an H-branch. While the position of TGL as a member of H-branch is well established and supported, an exact topology within the H-branch as well as an arrangement of other groups, varied slightly with different matrices. Generally, two alternative arrangements of H-branch were encountered during the analyses, one with AngambPEST-GP1 and the other with TGL as

a basal branch, respectively. The former arrangement was mainly produced by amino-acid matrices, while the latter was strongly supported by the nucleotide alignment and the combined matrix. The basal position of TGL displays a better fit to the phylogenetic relationships of H-branch members. However, it is important to note that none of the analyses treated the copies of AngambPEST-GP1-5 and Drosol-GP1-4 sequences as monophyletic clusters. It is difficult to decide, at the present stage of knowledge, whether this phylogenetic incongruity stems from a `mosaic' origin of the sequences or whether the phylogenetic information is suppressed by possible functional constraints (i.e. adaptation for various functions). A convergent evolution of lysozymes adapted for similar functions in phylogenetically distant organisms was previously demonstrated [11]. To date, nothing is known about the real function of Anopheles and Drosophila multilysozymes e.g. in what tissue these proteins are expressed, and whether or not they are post-translationally processed into individual lysozyme molecules. It is thus difficult to speculate about the functional relation of TGL to these proteins. In cell line derived from the mosquito Aedes aegypti, the lysozyme gene has been shown to be upregulated upon stimulation with heat-killed bacteria [25]. Recently, an extensive genomic-wide approach has been applied to survey the complex gene expression responses of A. gambiae to microbial and malaria challenge [26]. However, none of the lysozyme-related gene products like agCP3859, agCP3804, agCP3675 and/or the multi-lysozyme agCP6542 were taken into consideration in this study. To our surprise, the lysozyme family is not comprised in the mosquito-genome based bio-informatic analysis comparing 242 immune-related genes of A. gambiae with 185 homologs from Drosophila [27]. A phylogenetic interpretation is further limited by the fact that the TGL is the only lysozyme from the subphylum Chelicerata sequenced to date. The lysozyme is significantly up-regulated at the transcriptional level by a bloodmeal uptake. First, the method of semi-quantitative PCR based on one stepRT-PCR was used. Pilot experiments were performed in order to determine the linear response of the amplified product to the amount of total RNA taken for the reaction. The maximum difference in band

intensities between non-fed ticks and ticks one day PBM was observed when 1.2 ng of total RNA (dilution 1/10,000) was used for reverse-transcription followed by PCR amplification in 30 cycles. The time course of the mRNA level determined by one step RTPCR method is shown in Fig. 4. Visual comparison of band intensities showed that the maximum intensity of the 494 bp band was achieved one day PBM and then the mRNA level slowly declined to the basic level within the next 14 days (Fig. 4). RT-PCR analysis of other tissues dissected from the soft ticks revealed, that besides the gut, the lysozyme is also expressed to a lesser extend in salivary glands and in hemocytes. The sequences of the resulting PCR products (494 bp) were identical to TGL. The post

bloodmeal up-regulation was significant in the salivary glands, whereas, the mRNA levels detected in the hemocytes seemed not to be effected by bloodmeal uptake (data not shown). Similar post bloodmeal kinetics of the lysozyme mRNA level in tick gut was obtained using Northern blot analysis. The lysozyme mRNA appeared as a double band of about 950 ^ 150 and 650 ^ 100 bases on the Northern blots (Fig. 5) indicating that there exist two forms of lysozyme mRNA which most likely differ in untranslated region(s). In order to increase the resolution of the early expression profile, RNA was isolated in 4 h intervals PBM. Lysozyme mRNA level in the guts started to increase quickly 12 h PBM and reached its maximum already

One-step RT PCR was performed using a starting amount of 1.2 ng of isolated total RNA followed by reverse transcription and 30 cycles of PCR amplification.

some resistant microorganisms cannot be completely ruled out [29]. At present it is impossible to say unequivocally that transcription of the lysozyme gene in the gut is up-regulated in response to bacterial infection. The transcription may be also triggered just by the enormous physiological change of the engorged tick body or by the presence of bloodmeal or its component(s) (like in the case of early-trypsin translation in the mosquito midgut [30]). Certainly, much more experimental work based on well defined sterile vs. infectious feeding conditions and comparison with regulation of other tick gut-specific genes has to be done before we will be able to reasonably understand the complex problem.

Acknowledgements at 16 h PBM (Fig. 5). In contrast to this, the lytic activity of lysozyme in gut contents is rather constant and stable at least for one months PBM [5]. Podboronov and Berdyev [28] tested the lysozyme activity in whole-body homogenates of O. moubata artificially fed on blood infected with different bacteria species. They reported maximum lytic activity in about 24 h post infection feeding (typical increase of 8 ­ 10 fold over the control with sterile blood). In our experiments we have added a mixture of antibiotics ­ antimycotics into the bloodmeal to prevent microbial growth, however, the survival of This project was supported by the grant No. 206/00/0266 to P.K. from the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic and grant MSMT 12310003 from the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic.
