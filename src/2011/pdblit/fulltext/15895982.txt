ABSTRACT: Metals bound to proteins perform a number of crucial biological reactions, including the oxidation of water by a manganese cluster in photosystem II. Although evolutionarily related to photosystem II, bacterial reaction centers lack both a strong oxidant and a manganese cluster for mediating the multielectron and proton transfer needed for water oxidation. In this study, carboxylate residues were introduced by mutagenesis into highly oxidizing reaction centers at a site homologous to the manganesebinding site of photosystem II. In the presence of manganese, light-minus-dark difference optical spectra of reaction centers from the mutants showed a lack of the oxidized bacteriochlorophyll dimer, while the reduced primary quinone was still present, demonstrating that manganese was serving as a secondary electron donor. On the basis of these steady-state optical measurements, the mutant with the highestaffinity site had a dissociation constant of approximately 1 µM. For the highest-affinity mutant, a firstorder rate with a lifetime of 12 ms was observed for the reduction of the oxidized bacteriochlorophyll dimer by the bound manganese upon exposure to light. The dependence of the amplitude of this component on manganese concentration yielded a dissociation constant of approximately 1 µM, similar to that observed in the steady-state measurements. The three-dimensional structure determined by X-ray diffraction of the mutant with the high-affinity site showed that the binding site contains a single bound manganese ion, three carboxylate groups (including two groups introduced by mutagenesis), a histidine residue, and a bound water molecule. These reaction centers illustrate the successful design of a redox active metal center in a protein complex.

7390 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 20, 2005 transfer to a quinone via intermediate cofactors. The oxidation-reduction midpoint potential of the P/P+ couple can be altered by modifications of the hydrogen bonding pattern of P with nearby amino acid residues (2). This plasticity in the midpoint potential expands the range of redox chemistry that P can undergo, and modification by multiple mutations that increase the P/P+ midpoint potential enables the oxidation of specific tyrosine residues (3). Manganese can also be oxidized by modified reaction centers, but only weak binding of manganese to the reaction center, with a dissociation constant of >100 µM and a second-order rate constant for manganese oxidation, was observed (4). In this work, a manganese-binding site was designed in reaction centers such that the tightly bound manganese could donate an electron to P+. Protein engineering of novel metal centers that can carry out specific reactions is a challenging area of rational structure-based design (5). Designs for a manganese cofactor that would serve as a secondary electron donor to P+ were constrained by consideration of both the coordination of the manganese and the location of the binding site near P. Manganese in proteins is typically coordinated in an approximate octahedral geometry by two to four aspartate, glutamate, or histidine residues (6). In photosystem II, the manganese cluster is assembled through a light-dependent process called photoactivation (7). The first step of this process involves the binding of a single manganese(II) ion to a high-affinity binding site, and carboxylate residues, in particular, Asp 170 of the D1 subunit, have been shown to be required for this binding (8, 9). Although photosystem II is more complex, the core D1 and D2 subunits are homologous in structure and sequence to the L and M subunits of the bacterial reaction center (10-12). The residue Glu M173 in the reaction center from R. sphaeroides is in the position corresponding to Asp D1-170 (11), and this residue was included as a ligand to manganese in all designs for the manganese-binding sites. This location places the metal site approximately 10 Å from P. At this distance, the manganese ligands are sufficiently far from P that they would not involve changes in any amino acid residues in contact with P while being sufficiently close to allow efficient electron transfer from the bound Mn2+ to P+. In addition, M173 is near the surface of the reaction center in a region that would be more accommodating to the incorporation of the manganese and ligands than a buried interior site. In this paper, mutants with different designs for manganese-binding sites generated by modeling carboxylate residues near Glu M173 are characterized by determination of the binding affinity for Mn2+, the ability of Mn2+ to transfer an electron to P+, and the threedimensional structure. METHODS Design of Mutants. Potential manganese-binding sites in the reaction center were generated by modeling carboxylate residues in the wild-type structure using Insight II (Biosym/ MSI). Amino acid residues near Glu M173 were replaced with aspartate or glutamate to identify a set that could ligate manganese in approximate octahedral coordination. The oxygen atoms of the carboxyl residues were positioned by rotation of the C -C bond of aspartate or the C-C bond of glutamate residues, using different rotamer orientations

Accelerated Publications of the side chains. Residues involved in interactions with P were avoided to minimize perturbation of its redox properties. The substitution of Tyr for Arg at M164 was also included in all of the mutants, as this change removes the salt bridge interaction between Arg M164 and Glu M173 found in the wild type and also makes the region more similar to photosystem II, where Tyr D1-161 at the analogous location is active in the electron-transfer reactions associated with water oxidation. Three substitutions, Met M168 to Glu, Val M192 to Glu, and Gly M288 to Asp, were found to yield appropriate designs. Four variations of the binding site were created by different combinations of these mutations. In each of the computer-generated models, the distance from the manganese to the oxygen of the residues was between 2.1 and 2.8 Å. These distances are in the range observed for manganesebinding proteins, indicating that manganese coordination would be feasible. Mutant Construction and Protein Isolation. Mutants were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and manipulation of restriction fragments (2, 13, 14). The M1 mutant contains the Met M168 to Glu and Val M192 to Glu changes. The M2 mutant contains the Met M168 to Glu and Gly M288 to Asp changes. The M3 mutant contains the Val M192 to Glu and Gly M288 to Asp changes. The M4 mutant contains the Met M168 to Glu, Val M192 to Glu, and Gly M288 to Asp changes. The M1-M4 mutants and the control mutant all contain the Leu L131 to His, Leu M160 to His, and Phe M197 to His changes, used to increase the P/P+ midpoint potential, and the Arg M164 to Tyr mutation, which incorporates a tyrosine residue near P (3). The altered genes were introduced into R. sphaeroides deletion strain LM1.1 (15). The strains were grown semiaerobically in the dark for 3-4 days at 30 °C. For X-ray diffraction measurements, the reaction centers were isolated using published protocols (13) with the purified protein dialyzed against 15 mM TrisHCl (pH 8) and 0.025% lauryl dimethylamine oxide before crystallization. For spectroscopic measurements, after solubilization, the reaction centers were purified using ion exchange chromatography with DEAE-Sephacryl equilibrated with 0.05% Triton X-100 instead of 0.1% lauryl dimethylamine oxide. After the chromatography, the reaction centers were dialyzed against 15 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 0.05% Triton X-100 to remove EDTA. Steady-State and Transient Optical Spectroscopy. The fraction of reaction centers containing bound manganese in the presence of 0-1 mM MnCl2 was monitored by measuring the light-induced changes in the absorption spectrum from 700 to 1000 nm in a Cary 5 spectrophotometer (Varian). An Oriel tungsten lamp with an 860 ( 15 nm interference filter was used to illuminate the samples. The intensity was adjusted to approximately one-third of the saturating value of the wild type. For this intensity, the spectra were relatively insensitive to increases in illumination intensity and duration by a factor of 2. Before all titrations, the reaction centers were diluted in 15 mM CHES and 0.05% Triton X-100 (pH 8.9-9.4) to a concentration of 0.4-1.5 µM with 100 µM terbutryne to block electron transfer to the secondary quinone. The dissociation constant of manganese II binding to the reaction center was determined using a metal binding analysis previously described (16). The fraction of reaction centers

The fraction of reaction centers bound by manganese was found by monitoring the bleaching of the P band at 865 nm. Assuming the complete oxidation of manganese bound to reaction centers, the fraction of reaction centers without bound metal is given by the relative bleaching at 865 nm for reaction centers with manganese (A865) and in the M absence of manganese (A865): 0

The recovery of the primary donor after a single saturating flash was measured with a single-beam spectrometer of local design (17). A ND:YAG (Continuum) laser with a 5 ns laser pulse was used to excite the reaction centers at 532 nm, and the transient change in absorption at 865 nm was monitored. The transient optical measurements were performed in 15 mM Tris (pH 8), 0.05% Triton X-100, and 100 µM terbutryne. The recoveries were fit to one or two exponentials using a nonlinear least-squares method. The amplitude of the slow kinetic component (Aslow) compared to the total amplitude (Atotal) was used to calculate the fraction of reaction centers without bound metal:

RESULTS Characterization of Manganese Oxidation in the Mutant Reaction Centers by Optical Spectroscopy. In the absence of manganese, the light-induced spectra of the mutants were similar to those of the wild type (Figure 1), exhibiting features characteristic of both P+ and the reduced primary quinone (QA-). The features associated with P+ are an absorption decrease near 865 nm, an electrochromic shift of the bacteriochlorophyll monomer near 800 nm, and an electrochromic shift near 770 nm arising from the presence of a negative charge on QA-. As the manganese concentration was increased, the magnitude of the absorption change at 865 nm correspondingly decreased due to the loss of P+. In all cases, the amplitude of the spectral features of QAslightly increased as the amount of manganese increased, presumably due to a longer lifetime of the Mn3+PQA- state (Figure 1). At high concentrations of Mn2+, the features associated with P+ were no longer present with only the features associated with QA- remaining, including a small electrochromic shift of the 865 nm band. Within approximately 5 min of the end of illumination, these spectral features were no longer present, indicating that the reaction centers had fully recovered. The fraction of reaction centers with bound manganese, determined by the relative amount of P+ reduced in the presence of manganese, was found to systematically increase with an increase in Mn2+ concentration (Figure 1). Fitting these data to eq 2 yielded a dissociation constant for each mutant. The mutants showed different binding affinities, with M2 having a tight binding site, M1 and M4 having comparable and weaker binding sites, and M3 being unchanged relative to the control strain.

Protein Crystallography. Reaction centers from the wildtype and M2 strains were crystallized following conditions similar to those previously described (18) except for the substitution of manganese chloride for sodium chloride. Using vapor diffusion, a protein solution containing 12% polyethylene glycol 4000, 3.9% heptane triol, 0.06% lauryl dimethylamine oxide, 200 mM manganese chloride, 0.04 M sodium chloride, and reaction centers at a concentration A802 of 25 was equilibrated with a reservoir containing 15% polyethylene glycol 4000. Crystals could be grown without sodium chloride but grew to their largest size of approximately 0.3 mm × 0.3 mm × 0.5 mm when 10-40 mM sodium chloride was included. A detailed description of the crystallization of the wild type will be published elsewhere. These crystals belong to a tetragonal form, P4222, not previously described for reaction center crystals. X-ray diffraction data were measured for both the wild type and the M2 mutant using a RAXIS IV detector mounted on a rotating anode with Osmic mirrors. The diffraction measurements were processed using Mosflm (19) to resolution limits of 4.6 and 4.5 Å for the wild type and the M2 mutant, respectively. Using a wild-type structure (20), the position

Accelerated Publications centers (3, 23), and there was no evidence that Tyr M164 plays a role in metal oxidation under these conditions. The M1 and M4 mutants also showed an increase in the observed recovery rate in the presence of manganese, but no change was evident for the M3 or control mutant, even when the manganese concentration was 100 µM (data not shown). The lack of any change for the control mutant shows that the rate of electron transfer from exogenous manganese is much slower than the P+QA- charge recombination rate. Thus, this second-order process does not contribute to the observed spectral decreases at 1-10 µM manganese in the steady-state absorption measurements, and is only evident at higher manganese concentrations. Determination of Structural Changes Associated with the Mutations and Manganese Binding by Protein Crystallography. When manganese(II) chloride was substituted for sodium chloride in crystallization conditions that have previously resulted in an orthorhombic form (18), reaction centers from both the wild type and the M2 mutant crystallized in a tetragonal form that diffracted to a resolution limit of approximately 4.5 Å. The resulting structures of the wild type and the M2 mutant were very similar, with the only notable region of difference being at the mutation site, which showed a significant amount of electron density in the M2 mutant but not in the wild type (Figure 3). While the basic features of the manganese binding have been identified in the mutant, the limited resolution does not allow detailed modeling of bond distances and angles. The electron density for the M2 mutant at the site of the mutations had one prominent peak assigned to manganese and an extended region that is modeled as arising from the presence of two water molecules. After incorporation of the amino acid changes and the manganese atom, the resulting structural model refined to an R-factor of 30% and an Rfree of 34%. This structure of the M2 mutant is in agreement with the initial design as Glu M173, Glu M168, and Asp M288 are clearly in the binding site (Figure 3). The manganese and residues Asp M288 and Asp M292 interact with the bound water molecules. These residues are located in a C-terminal loop region, which is shifted in the mutant approximately 0.5 Å relative to that in the wild type. Also nearby is His M193, a putative proton acceptor for Tyr M164 in a different highly oxidizing reaction center (3). The three-dimensional structure shows that the imidazole ring of His M193 shifts in position compared to that of the wild type and provides a ligand opposite to Glu M168. DISCUSSION A manganese center has been introduced into modified reaction centers at a distance of approximately 13 Å from the conjugated system of P, and the manganese efficiently transfers an electron to P with a lifetime of 12 ms. This new electron-transfer reaction is consistent with the observation that rapid electron transfer in proteins occurs at distances of <14 Å even when parameters such as the free energy difference and reorganization energy are not optimized (24). For the M2 mutant, the manganese binds tightly with a dissociation constant of 1 µM determined from two independent measurements. The manganese bound less tightly to the M1 and M4 mutants, while no change in manganese binding was evident for the M3 mutant compared to the

FIGURE 2: Kinetics of P+ reduction in the M2 mutant at pH 9. (a) The decay rate of P+, as measured by the change in absorption at 865 nm, significantly increased in the presence of Mn2+ compared to the rate in the absence of Mn2+. The lines are fits showing that P+ recovered with a lifetime of 42 ms with no Mn2+, the decay was biphasic with a slow and a fast component with 1 µM Mn2+, and only the fast component with a lifetime of 12 ms was observed with 100 µM Mn2+. (b) The relative fraction of the slow component decreased with the amount of Mn2+. The solid line is a fit of the data using eq 3 with a dissociation constant of 1.0 µM. (c) The rates of both the fast and slow components were independent of the amount of Mn2+, with measured rates of 74-83 s-1 (lifetimes of 12-14 ms) for reduction of P+ by bound Mn2+ (0) and 21-26 s-1 (lifetimes of 39-48 ms) for reduction of P+ by charge recombination from QA- (4).

measurements, dissociation constants of 1.5 ( 1, 8 ( 3, and 14 ( 5 µM for the M2, M1, and M4 mutants, respectively, were obtained. In kinetic measurements, the recovery of P+ at 865 nm became faster when Mn2+ was added (Figure 2). For the M2 mutant, the P+QA- charge recombination time was 42 ms in the absence of manganese. When manganese was present, the recovery was biphasic and could be fitted by including a second exponential term with a lifetime of approximately 12 ms. The rate of this fast component was independent of the manganese concentration, showing that it arose from a first-order reaction, and it is assigned to reduction of P+ by the bound manganese. The rate of charge recombination, as determined from the slower component, was also found to be independent of manganese concentration. As the manganese concentration was increased, the relative amplitude of the slow component decreased compared to that of the fast component. The dependence of these components on the manganese concentration provided an independent measure of the manganese binding affinity. The fraction of the slow component was fitted to eq 3, yielding a dissociation constant of approximately 1 µM, similar to the value of the dissociation constant determined from the steady-state measurements. The observed rate of P+ recovery was much faster than the rates associated with tyrosine oxidation in modified reaction

control. The presence of manganese at the designed site was verified by the determination of the three-dimensional structure of the M2 mutant using protein crystallography. The measured binding affinity for manganese clearly differs for the four different mutants, although the original computer designs showed a similar modeling of the coordination of manganese. Comparison of the relative affinities and designs of the mutants points to particular amino acid residues being key to the binding of manganese at this site. For example, the presence of Glu M168 appears to be critical, as it is found in the three mutants, M1, M2, and M4, that show improved binding relative to the control, but is missing in the M3 mutant that has a dissociation constant indistinguishable from that of the control. The three-dimensional structure of the M2 mutant, which had the highest affinity for manganese, shows that the imidazole ring of His M193 shifts in position compared to that of the wild type and provides a ligand opposite to Glu M168. This pairing of His M93 and Glu M168 across the manganese appears to be significant, and was not modeled in the original design. Part of the reason that Glu M192, which is found in the M1, M3, and M4 mutants but not the M2 mutant, may be less effective in the coordination of manganese is that it is adjacent to His M193 and so would be in an unfavorable position to form a

Glu-His pair. Asp M288 was incorporated in the M2, M3, and M4 mutants, and the structure of the M2 mutant shows that it serves both as a ligand and in the stabilization of the two bound water molecules, along with Glu M168 and Glu M292. Glu M292 is part of the C-terminal loop that has shifted in the structure of M2 relative to that of the wild type, and this interaction of Glu M292 with water molecules in the binding site was also not modeled in the original design. The M4 mutant has the Asp M288 residue in addition to the Glu M168 and Glu M192 residues found in the M2 mutant, and the lower affinity for manganese compared to that of the M2 mutant is probably due to the additional negative charge. Thus, while the original design of manganese binding to the introduced carboxylates proved to be successful, the mutants show differences in binding affinities due to the involvement of amino acid residues such as His M193 and Glu M292 near the carboxylates that were not part of the original design. The manganese-binding site of M2 is similar in a number of ways to the binding site of the four-manganese cluster of photosystem II, including the location on the protein (Figure 4). Several residues near the binding site in the reaction center, including Glu M173, His M193, and Tyr M164, have counterparts in photosystem II, in this case, Asp D1-170, His D1-190, and Tyr D1-161, respectively (11, 25). The designed site has a carboxylate group at a position comparable to Asp D1-170, which is thought to initiate manganese binding in the photoactivation process. In photosystem II, water can be converted to molecular oxygen in part because P680 has a midpoint potential of more than 1 V, whereas P with a midpoint potential of approximately 0.5 V in wildtype bacterial reaction centers is not a sufficiently strong oxidant (26). On the basis of the hydrogen bond mutations

7394 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 20, 2005 used to modify the potential, the P/P+ midpoint potential of these manganese-binding mutants is estimated to be increased relative to that of the wild type by approximately 0.27 mV (2). The mutations at the manganese-binding site are expected to have a small electrostatic effect on the P/P+ midpoint potential (27). Other mutations have been shown to result in an increase in the potential above 0.8 V, which is necessary for water oxidation and provides the capacity to oxidize Tyr M164 (3). Thus, this design also provides the opportunity to couple electron transfer to proton transfer and opens the possibility of investigating the mechanism of manganese cofactor incorporation in proteins such as photosystem II. The development of a bacterial reaction center with bound manganese that serves as an efficient secondary electron donor to P+ demonstrates that with a limited number of amino acid changes, a primitive photosystem could have achieved both a potential sufficient to oxidize manganese and a manganese-binding site near P. Manganese is found in sediments, and its availability could have provided a manganese-oxidizing primitive photosystem with a special ecological niche. No anoxygenic phototroph has been identified as being capable of manganese oxidation, although a number of photosynthetic bacteria can oxidize iron (28). The design of proteins with new metal cofactors that have well-defined redox activity remains a biochemical challenge (29). The incorporation of manganese into the bacterial reaction center provides an opportunity to determine how proteins control the properties of bound metals through the interactions between the metal and nearby amino acid residues. For example, these results provide the basis for investigating the specificity for manganese binding and the factors that control the redox activity of the metal. In addition, since the oxidation state of P is controlled by light, the manganese-binding mutants provide the foundation for the development of a light-driven metal-based catalyst.
