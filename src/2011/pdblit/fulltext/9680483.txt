The protein product (c-Myc) of the protooncogene c-myc is a transcriptional regulator playing a key role in cellular growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Deregulated myc genes, like the transduced retroviral v-myc allele, are oncogenic and cause cell transformation. The C-terminal bHLHZip domain of v-Myc, encompassing protein dimerization (helixloop-helix, leucine zipper) and DNA contact (basic region) surfaces, was expressed in bacteria as a highly soluble p15v-myc recombinant protein. Dissociation constants (Kd) for the heterodimer formed with the recombinant bHLHZip domain of the Myc binding partner Max (p14max) and for the Myc-Max-DNA complex were estimated using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and quantitative electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the solution structural and dynamic properties of the v-Myc bHLHZip domain. Signi®cant secondary chemical shifts indicate the presence of two separated a-helical regions. The C-terminal leucine zipper region forms a compact a-helix, while the N-terminal basic region exhibits conformational averaging with substantial a-helical content. Both helices lack stabilizing tertiary side-chain interactions and represent exceptional examples for loosely coupled secondary structural segments in a native protein. These results and CD thermal denaturation data indicate a monomeric state of the v-Myc bHLHZip domain. The 15N relaxation data revealed backbone mobilities which corroborate the existence of a partially folded state, and suggest a ``beads-on-a-string'' motional behaviour of the v-Myc bHLHZip domain in solution. The preformation of a-helical regions was con®rmed by CD thermal denaturation studies, and quanti®cation of the entropy changes caused by the hydrophobic effect and the reduction of conformational entropy upon protein dimerization. The restricted conformational space of the v-Myc bHLHZip domain reduces the entropy penalty associated with heterodimerization and allows rapid and accurate recognition by the authentic Myc binding partner Max.

Introduction
The v-myc oncogene of avian acute leukemia virus MC29 was derived by retroviral transduction from the cellular protooncogene c-myc that ful®ls important regulatory functions in cell growth and differentiation (Bister & Jansen, 1986; Blackwood et al., 1992a; Kato & Dang, 1992). The protein products (Myc) of myc alleles are sequence-speci®c DNA-binding proteins (Blackwell et al., 1990; Prendergast & Ziff, 1991; Kerkhoff et al., 1991) of

1396 the bHLHZip-type containing helix-loop-helix (HLH: helix1(H1)-loop-helix2(H2)) and leucine zipper (Zip) protein dimerization domains, and a basic region (b) as the major DNA contact surface. Myc proteins preferentially form heterodimers with the bHLHZip protein Max (Blackwood & Eisenman, 1991; Blackwood et al., 1992b), and the Myc-Max transcription factor complex is implicated in the transcriptional regulation of target genes mediating the multiple effects of myc on cellular growth, proliferation, metabolism, and differentiation (Grandori & Eisenman, 1997; Dang, 1999; Iritani & Eisenman, 1999; Coller et al., 2000). Max also forms homodimers and heterodimeric complexes with the bHLHZip proteins Mad or Mnt, antagonizing the functions of myc by competing with Myc-Max for common DNA target (E-box) sites (Ayer et al., 1993; Hurlin et al., 1997). The X-ray crystal structure analysis of homodimeric Â complexes of the bHLHZip domain of Max (FerreÂ D'Amare et al., 1993) or of full-length Max (Brownlie et al., 1997) with bound DNA revealed a protein fold characterized by a parallel, lefthanded, four-helix bundle with each monomer containing two a-helical segments (bH1 and H2Zip) separated by a loop. For the oncoprotein Myc, the structural information so far available has been provided by the analysis of synthetic peptides representing the 28 amino acid residue leucine zipper region. It was shown by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and 1H-NMR analysis that Myc Zip peptides do not form stable homodimers, but readily associate with synthetic Max Zip peptides forming stable heterodimers with the typical lefthanded super-helical twist of a two-stranded parallel a-helical coiled-coil (Muhle-Goll et al., 1994, 1995; Lavigne et al., 1995, 1998). Here, we report on structural, functional, dynamic, and thermodynamic analyses of the entire 103 amino acid residue bHLHZip domain of v-Myc necessary for dimerization and DNA binding. The NMR structural analyses and the thermodynamics of dimerization serve to illustrate how the partially folded or monomeric states of protein binding partners are utilized to tailor the functionally important speci®city of protein-protein associations in the transcriptional network of the cell.

from a polycistronic mRNA speci®ed by a pET expression construct and copuri®cation under native conditions, yielding an equimolar Myc  Max protein preparation (Figure 1(a)-(c)). Determination of the dissociation constant (see below) suggests that Myc and Max form a stable heterodimer already in the bacterial environment, and that this dimer remains stable during puri®cation. Homogeneous highly soluble Myc protein was obtained by denaturation of the dimer, separation of the two proteins by ion exchange chromatography, and subsequent complete renaturation (Figure 1(c)). In contrast to the Myc protein, the Max recombinant protein readily forms homodimers (see below) and could also be prepared in a highly soluble homogeneous form when expressed from an expression plasmid only encoding Max (Figure 1(c)). The calculated Mr of the 105 amino acid residue p15v-myc and of the 93 amino acid residue p14max proteins are 12,587 and 10,927, respectively, and their estimated isoelectric points are 10.92 and 10.64, respectively. Determination of Mr by mass spectrometry revealed 12,587.6(Æ0.5) and 12,456.5(Æ0.5) for p15v-myc, and 10,796.9(Æ0.5) for p14max, indicating partial (Myc) or complete (Max) removal of the initiating methionine residue. This was directly con®rmed by N-terminal sequencing. The apparent Mr of approximately 15,000 (Myc) and 14,000 (Max), respectively, re¯ect the anomalous electrophoretic mobility typical for Myc (Kerkhoff & Bister, 1991; Kerkhoff et al., 1991) and Max (Blackwood & Eisenman, 1991; Blackwood et al., 1992b) proteins. Analyses of v-Myc and Max dimerization and DNA binding The CD spectrum of the bHLHZip domain of v-Myc (Figure 2(a)) reveals that the overall helical content under native conditions is low (27 %), yet it indicates the existence of isolated a-helical segments. A similar CD spectral appearance was observed for the C-helix from chicken lysozyme in 20 % tri¯uoroethanol and for the equilibrium molten globule state of apomyoglobin at pH 4.1 (Bolin et al., 1996; Eliezer et al., 1997). In contrast, CD spectra obtained for the Max homodimer and the Myc-Max heterodimer display the typical features for a-helical proteins with two minima at 208 and 222 nm, respectively, and the intensity ratios of the two absorption bands (y222/y208 > 1.03) are characteristic for coiled-coil formations (Cooper & Woody, 1990). CD deconvolution yielded overall a-helical contents of 68 % for the Max homodimer and 70 % for the Myc-Max heterodimer. Temperature-induced denaturation of the Max homodimer and Myc-Max heterodimer complexes recorded by monitoring [y]222 revealed cooperative transitions and imply a two-state folding-unfolding transition in the case of Max and Myc  Max protein preparations (Figure 2(a)). The melting point at pH 7 was 38  C for the Max homodimer and 55  C for the Myc-Max heterodimer. In contrast, the melting

Results and Discussion
Highly soluble v-Myc and Max recombinant proteins Structural analyses of Myc proteins have so far been complicated by the low degree of solubility of Myc recombinant proteins expressed in bacteria. This may be due to the low potential of Myc proteins to form ordered homodimers (see below) and to the formation of non-speci®c aggregates in the bacterial environment. Highly soluble recombinant proteins representing the bHLHZip domains of MC29 v-Myc and of chicken Max were prepared in Escherichia coli by coexpression of both proteins

curve for Myc does not provide any evidence for cooperativity, but shows a gradual thermal denaturation of the protein and indicates its monomeric state. The CD data obtained for the v-Myc bHLHZip domain are in agreement with studies on c-Myc Zip peptides (Muhle-Goll et al., 1994, 1995; Lavigne et al., 1995, 1998), and imply the existence of isolated secondary structure elements missing stabilizing tertiary side-chain interactions in the native proteins. The addition of double-stranded (ds) DNA containing a consensus Myc/Max binding site (Blackwell et al., 1990; Prendergast & Ziff, 1991; Kerkhoff et al., 1991) to the Myc protein preparation led to a signi®cant increase of the a-helical content from 27 % to 58 % as determined by CD spectroscopy, and also to a thermal denaturation curve now displaying cooperativity with a melting

point of 53  C (Figure 2(b)). Maximum a-helical content was achieved at a Myc:DNA molar ratio of 2:1 (data not shown). This indicates that Myc, monomeric without DNA, binds to DNA as a homodimer. Addition of DNA to the Max or Myc  Max protein preparations led to a signi®cant stabilization of the complexes (Figure 2(b)). The ahelical content of Max increased by 18 % and that of Myc  Max by 14 %, and the melting points increased from 38  C to 61  C for Max and from 55  C to 73  C for Myc  Max (Figure 2(a) and (b)). DNA titration experiments monitored by CD showed that Max and Myc  Max protein preparations, like Myc, bind to DNA as dimers (data not shown). CD thermal denaturation studies of the protein dimers at various pH values allowed the calculation of the thermodynamic functions ÁHd

(enthalpy function), ÁSd (entropy function), and ÁGd (free energy function) for dimer dissociation and unfolding (Figure 3(a)-(c)). Over the whole temperature range, the stability curves (Figure 3(c)) indicate that the Myc-Max heterodimer is thermodynamically more stable than the Max homodimer (the dimer dissocation constant (Kd) at 37  C is 2.5 Â 10À9 M for Myc-Max, and 3.1 Â 10À5 M for Max-Max). Consequently, the Myc  Max recombinant protein preparation contains predominantly Myc-Max heterodimers, but negligible amounts of Max homodimers or of Myc or Max monomers. Figure 3 also demonstrates that the Max homodimer is enthalpically more favoured but entropically more disfavoured than the Myc-Max heterodimer, leading to an overall lower stability of the homodimer. This could be attributed to a less compact structure of the monomeric state of Max as compared to Myc. The total entropy change of protein dissociation (ÁSd) can be dissected into favourable contributions, like increase of translational and rotational degrees of freedom (ÁSrt), increase of conformational degrees of freedom and other contributions (ÁSother), as well as unfavourable contributions, like the hydrophobic effect (ÁSHE), i.e. exposure of newly solvent accessible non-polar surface areas, ÁAnp, upon dissociation and unfolding. It has been convincingly demonstrated that thermodynamic data from model compound transfers can be used to dissect the various contri-

butions to protein-protein and protein-DNA associations, or protein folding transitions (Baldwin, 1986; Shortle et al., 1988; Spolar et al., 1989, 1992; Livingstone et al., 1991; Spolar & Record, 1994). Hence, analysis of the entropy change ÁSd was used to delineate the details of homodimerization (Max-Max) and heterodimerization (Myc-Max). Table 1 shows a comparison between experimental data and calculated ÁSd values, indicating that Myc-Max heterodimerization is distinctly different from Max homodimerization with respect to the number of residues involved. CD spectroscopy indicates residual helical structure in the monomeric state of Myc, and according to this model, the calculated number of residues involved in folding upon heterodimerization (n  106) is close to the experimental value (n  110). In contrast, a random coil - helix transition model is proposed for Max homodimerization, and the calculated number of folded residues (n  132) is also close to the experimental value from CD-spectroscopy (n  126). Thus, the monomeric state of Max is best described as an unfolded, random coil-like polypeptide chain with no conformational preferences, whereas Myc appears to adopt a more con®ned monomeric conformation in solution, presumably due to partial preformation of the leucine zipper region. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses (EMSA) were performed to verify the functional integrity of

The contribution to the entropy change by the hydrophobic effect, ÁSHE, is directly proportional to the change in the solvent accessible non-polar surface (ÁAnp) upon dissociation.

the recombinant proteins, to con®rm the stoichiometry of the protein-DNA complexes, and to allow a quantitative determination of their DNAbinding capacity (Figure 4(a)-(c)). Binding of DNA containing an E-box consensus site by increasing amounts of Myc, Max, or Myc  Max protein preparations, and quanti®cation of bound and unbound dsDNA allowed the calculation of the dissociation constants for the protein-DNA complexes. In contrast to Max or Myc  Max proteins, Myc partially dissociates from DNA during electrophoresis, which was taken into account for the quanti®cation of bound DNA. The experimental conditions also

led to partial DNA strand separation, but only dsDNA was considered for the quanti®cation of unbound DNA. The EMSA analyses allowed the determination of Kd(total), the product of Kd(dimerization) and Kd(DNA-binding), assuming that the proteins bind to ds DNA as homo- or heterodimers. Kd(total) values at 23  C are 7.2 Â 10À20 M2 for Myc-Max-DNA, 1.6 Â 10À18 M2 for Max2DNA, and 2.7 Â 10À14 M2 for Myc2-DNA. Comparison of these data with Kd(dimerization) at 23  C for Myc-Max (3.4 Â 10À11 M) and Max-Max (1.3 Â 10À7 M) obtained by CD-analysis (cf. Figure 3(a)) indicates that the Max homodimer,

triple-resonance NMR experiments (Kay, 1995) using (13C, 15N)-labeled protein led to complete sequence-speci®c assignment for all of the backbone 1HN, 15N, and 13C resonances and all of the 13 C side-chain resonances. No resonance assignment was achieved for the side-chain aliphatic protons. Deviations of experimental 13CO, 13Ca, and 13 b C chemical shifts from their ``random coil'' values were taken as measures for the extent of secondary structure of the various residues in v-Myc (Figure 6). It is evident that the v-Myc bHLHZip domain does not represent a random coil structure in solution, but displays a pronounced sequence-dependence of the protein structural preferences in the a-helical region of the f,c-Ramachandran space. Speci®cally, residues 326 to 349 and 386 to 412 show distinct down-®eld shifts for both 13CO and 13Ca and up-®eld shifts for 13 b C resonances, respectively, indicative of a-helical structures (the average a-helical 13Ca secondary down®eld shift is 3.1(Æ1.0); cf. Spera & Bax, 1991). The secondary shifts in the N-terminal helix are smaller than in the C-terminal helical region, suggesting a higher conformational ¯exibility for the basic region of v-Myc. As expected for a-helical structures, 1HN secondary shifts (Á1HN) are negative for residues located in these regions of Myc. However, no periodicity of Á1HN indicative of structural distortions typical for a-helical coiledcoil structures (Zhou et al., 1992) was detected. In contrast to the backbone atoms, no signi®cant deviations from random coil values were observed for side-chain 13Cg,d,e resonances. The localization of

Chemical shift analysis and secondary structure of the v-Myc bHLHZip domain The spectral features of the v-Myc bHLHZip domain, like pronounced shift degeneracy and signi®cant line width variations (Figure 5), are characteristic for a peptide lacking considerable structural heterogeneity. The signal assignment was complicated by the low chemical shift dispersion in the 1 H dimension (0.6 ppm) and the high overlap in the 15N dimension (50 % of the signals appear within 2 ppm). Nevertheless, gradient-enhanced

1401 ation factors did not reveal a signi®cant correlation with the location of secondary structure elements (i.e. 13C secondary shifts) and thus re¯ect the partially folded nature of v-Myc in aqueous solution. The observation of more uniform protection from intermolecular exchange for consecutive residues in the C-terminal Zip domain may be due to distinctive conformational preferences of this polypeptide segment rather than persistent hydrogen bonds. This indicates that the residual structures observed for the basic region and the Zip domain are best described as a-helical segments lacking cooperatively formed hydrogen bonds and experiencing dihedral angle ¯uctuations about the mean f and c values. Both 13C secondary shifts and amide proton attenuation factors suggest increased main-chain conformational ¯uctuations for the N-terminal basic region compared to the C-terminal Zip domain. Interestingly, residues in helix1 and helix2 of v-Myc, which correspond to stable a-helical regions in the crystal structure of Â Â the Max2-DNA complex (Ferre-D'Amare et al., 1993), did not show any spectral evidence for secondary structure in solution. Relaxation parameters and reduced spectraldensity mapping of the v-Myc bHLHZip domain The local dynamics of each individual site of the polypeptide chain were investigated by means of 15 N longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation, as well as steady-state {1H}-15N heteronuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) (Figure 7). T2 relaxation times were used to characterize backbone motions of Myc. The variation of T2 along the backbone signi®cantly differs from the pro®le obtained for denatured or unfolded states, where residues in the centre of the protein are considerably less mobile than those at the termini, leading to a bellshaped distribution of dynamics along the protein backbone (Farrow et al., 1997; Buevich & Baum, 1999). In contrast, several segments with characteristic T2 values can be identi®ed in v-Myc. As expected, the termini of the protein are considerably mobile. Two segments corresponding to the basic region and the leucine zipper, respectively, display signi®cantly reduced T2 values, which is indicative of the existence of restricted backbone motion due to secondary structure formation. They are separated by a more ¯exible segment in the loop region showing higher T2 values. Thus, the motional picture provided by the T2 relaxation times coincides with the position of secondary structure elements revealed by 13CO, 13Ca, and 13Cb secondary shifts. Residues located at the end of helix1 and in helix2 represent the only exceptions displaying lower T2 values than expected. This part of the protein backbone presumably displays ms to ms time scale conformational reorientations (see below). {1H}-15N NOEs were used as a probe for highfrequency backbone motions and are shown as a function of residue position (Figure 7). Positive

Black boxes in the schematic diagram at the top denote the predicted a-helical regions within the bHLHZip domain of Myc (cf. Figure 1). Random coil 13CO, 13Ca, and 13Cb values were used as described (Wishart et al., 1995), with appropriate corrections for residues preceding proline residue.

pronounced helical formation coincides with the position of the basic region including additional N and C-terminal residues, and of the leucine zipper of v-Myc, based on sequence similarity with other bHLHZip family members (cf. Figures 1(b) and 6). The existence of a-helical structures was con®rmed by the observation of characteristic sequential 1 N H (i)-1HN(i  1) homonuclear Overhauser effects È (NOE) (Wuthrich, 1986), with stronger sequential NOEs in the C-terminal helix. However, no signi®cant sequential (i,i  2) 1HN-1HN NOEs could be detected. Intramolecular hydrogen bond formation was probed by measurements of amide attenuation factors (e.g. retardation of amide protons from intermolecular exchange with bulk water). Due to the high degree of spectral resolution in the 3D HNCO-type experiment (see Materials and Methods), the individual amide resonances of all residues in v-Myc could be resolved. The attenu-

NOE values indicating restricted mobility were found for residues located in a-helical structures, whereas negative NOEs (large amplitude ¯uctuations) are detected for residues in the loop region connecting the two a-helices, and at both ends of the polypeptide chain. A striking experimental result is the overall low NOE value for residues in the a-helical parts of v-Myc (typically, NOE values of 0.75 are observed for residues in a well-ordered part of a polypeptide chain). For example, residues 389 to 405 have NOE values of about 0.3. However, similar NOE values were found for residues located in the partially formed H helix of the pH 2.3 state of apomyoglobin (Eliezer et al., 1998), and for residues in the C-terminal helix in the partially folded A state of ubiquitin (Brutscher et al., 1997). In both cases, the reduced NOE values indicated the presence of loosely coupled secondary structure elements with enhanced internal ¯exibility as compared to the respective native states.

In contrast, in the molten gobule state of apomyoglobin (Eliezer et al., 1998), NOEs close to the maximum positive values were observed, implying that the helices are more closely packed and form a compact core reducing the backbone ¯uctuations of the protein. Hence, the signi®cantly reduced NOE values in v-Myc re¯ect the absence of any additional stabilizing side-chain interactions and provide additional evidence that the two helices are stabilized only by weak intrasegmental rather than by distinct long-range interactions, which is in agreement with the absence of (i,i  2) NOEs. To investigate potential homodimerization of v-Myc, 15N relaxation parameters were measured using protein concentrations of 2 mM, 1 mM, and 0.5 mM. Dilution of the protein sample led to a systematic increase of the longitudinal relaxation rate R1 and a reduction by $16 % of the average transverse relaxation rate R2. Residues 367 to 377 displayed signi®cantly larger R2 reduction (4050 %) upon dilution. However, no changes in the 1 H-15N chemical shifts were detectable, the only exception being residue V380 (1H:0.016ppm; 15 N:0.14ppm) which is located in the conformationally disordered loop segment connecting the two a-helical parts of v-Myc. The overall shift in the magnitudes of the 15N relaxation parameter would be thus consistent with a partial although nonspeci®c association of the protein at these concentrations. In part, the variation of the 15N R2 for residues 367 to 377 may be also due to the dependence of the exchange lifetime of the conformational exchange process on the viscosity of the protein solution. A similar experimental observation was made in a NMR dynamic study of the dynamin pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (Fushman et al., 1997). It was demonstrated that weak and nonspeci®c association promoted by hydrophobic patches on the protein surface leads to a change in the 15N relaxation parameter and, interestingly, that residues located in conformationally ¯exible parts of the molecule (milli- to microsecond timescale) typically exhibit more pronouned relaxation parameter changes upon protein dilution (Fushman et al., 1997). Interestingly, the residues located in the protein core of v-Myc (367 to 377) correspond to helices H1 and H2 of the HLH motif which are part of the hydrophobic core in the fourhelix bundle structure presumably formed upon formation of the heterodimeric Myc-Max protein complex. Most importantly, however, the absence of a distinct dependence of the chemical shift pattern on the protein concentration disproves the possibility that the formation of the two a-helices is a direct consequence of unspeci®c v-Myc protein association in solution. Rather, the formation of the helices is an inherent feature caused by the secondary structural preferences of residues in the basic and leucine zipper region of v-Myc. Reduced spectral density-mapping (Farrow et al., 1995; Peng & Wagner, 1995) was applied for analyzing the relaxation data. The values of J(0), J(oN), and J(0.87oH) are given in Figure 8. Again,

1403 ®cation of conformational ¯exibility in the millisecond to microsecond time-scale at these sites. The relationship between secondary structure formation and restricted local polypeptide motion in the basic region and in the C-terminal Zip domain of v-Myc is in line with previous NMR studies of the backbone dynamics of unfolded states of proteins (Alexandrescu & Shortle, 1994; Logan et al., 1994; Red®eld et al., 1994; Frank et al., 1995; Buck et al., 1996; Farrow et al., 1997; Buevich & Baum, 1999). Many of these studies also presented structural information, and it was demonstrated that restrictions in the internal motions in the unfolded states are closely related to the extent of residual structure within the protein. For example, Dobson and co-workers studied the partially folded states of two proteins, the molten-globule state of interleukin-4 at low pH conditions (Red®eld et al., 1994) and the tri¯uoroethanol-denatured state of lysozyme (Buck et al., 1996). It was demonstrated that persistent secondary structure and the presence of disul®de bonds are the principal factors governing the extent of intramolecular mobility. Highly ¯exible portions of the polypeptide are often located at glycine residues, due to the absence of side-chain sterical hindrance. In addition, it was demonstrated that the highly disordered fragment of staphylococcal nuclease, Á131Á, possesses a motionally restricted polypeptide segment that contains most of the residual structure observed for this mutant protein (Alexandrescu & Shortle, 1994). The authors pointed out that this immobilized region of the protein displays high hydrophobicity, and they suggested that a partial hydrophobic collapse of the protein additionally in¯uences the backbone dynamics of the unfolded state. Based on these ®ndings, important conclusions can be drawn about the backbone dynamics and the residual structure of v-Myc in comparison to Max. It appears that the extent of secondary structure formation in the C-terminal Zip domain is responsible for the motional restriction in v-Myc, instead of a partial hydrophobic collapse. This is indicated by the fact that the a-helical propensities for residues located in the Zip domain of v-Myc are on average larger than in Max and that for this part of v-Myc no signi®cant hydrophobicity differences compared to Max are found. Interestingly, in contrast to what was observed for the partially ordered staphylococcal nuclease fragment Á131Á, the structurally ordered Zip domain of v-Myc corresponds to the most hydrophilic stretch of the protein (together with the basic region which is involved in DNA-binding). Again, this corroborates the existence of an isolated a-helix in the C terminus of v-Myc and disproves the existence of stabilizing tertiary interactions resulting from a partial hydrophobic collapse of the protein.

the C-terminal a-helical regions show distinctly different dynamical properties, displaying signi®cantly larger than average J(0) values and lower than average J(0.87oH) values. Additionally, residues (350 to 353 and 369 to 385) located next to the transiently formed a-helical regions also exhibit increased values of J(0), indicating milli- to microsceond time-scale motions. Backbone dynamics and residual structure of v-Myc The correlation between deviations from random coil chemical shift values and backbone dynamics convincingly demonstrates that residues with signi®cant secondary shifts are located in wellordered, hydrogen-bonded and motionally restricted helical segments and do not populate unfolded and rapidly interconverting substates located in the a-helical region of the Ramachandran space. In contrast, random coil chemical shifts are observed for sites with relaxation parameters typical for a rapidly ¯uctuating, random coil polypetide. Residues 350 to 385 signi®cantly deviate from this correlation displaying larger than expected J(0) values, which underscores the identi-

1404 Functional implications of the structural and dynamic properties of the v-Myc bHLHZip domain The molecular determinants for dimerization speci®city and DNA binding are located in the C-terminal bHLHZip region of Myc proteins (Blackwell et al., 1990; Prendergast & Ziff, 1991; Kerkhoff et al., 1991; Blackwood et al., 1992a; Kato & Dang, 1992). The NMR data demonstrate that the bHLHZip domain of v-Myc exists in solution in a prestructured form displaying two a-helical subdomains (Figure 9(a)). Residues in the N-terminal (basic) subdomain transiently form an a-helical structure, whereas the C-terminal (Zip) helix displays a more rigid conformation. For residues in v-Myc corresponding to helices H1 and H2 of the HLH motif, no evidence for the occurrence of stable secondary structure in solution was found,

Structure, Function, and Dynamics of v-Myc

although residues in helix1 adjacent to the basic region exhibit a slightly larger tendency towards an a-helical structure. 15N relaxation data suggest that the helix1 and helix2 regions are not prestructured in v-Myc but undergo conformational reorientations in the ms to ms time scale and, together with the loop region, form a ¯exible linker between the two helical segments. Most importantly, the C-terminal leucine zipper region of Myc which confers speci®city of protein binding (Blackwood & Eisenman, 1991; Blackwood et al., 1992a,b; Muhle-Goll et al., 1995; Lavigne et al., 1995, 1998) is well ordered in solution. It thus seems plausible that this preformed helical structure will act as a nucleus for intermolecular association with Max and thereby facilitates protein recognition (Figure 9(b)). It also leads to a signi®cant restriction of the conformational space amenable to v-Myc and thus reduces the entropy

Figure 9. Schematic illustration of the conformational space of the v-Myc bHLHZip domain and proposed mode of binding to Max. (a) The dynamic structure of Myc can best be described as a distribution of conformational substates and the existence of motions within and between the substates. Intra-substate motions comprise fast (pico- to nanoseconds) local protein backbone ¯uctuations, whereas inter-substate motions presumably occur at larger time-scales and involve larger segments of the protein. Due to the preformation of secondary structure elements in Myc, helical fraying in the bHLH segment and the time-dependent orientation of the two helical domains are the dominant intramolecular motions with large amplitudes in Myc. (b) Proposed mechanism of Myc recognition by Max. The preformed helical Zip domain of Myc constitutes a hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction template which serves as the nucleus of the dimerization process. As a ®rst step in the dimerization process, an encounter complex is formed which is dominated by speci®c electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (red arrows) between the Myc and Max Zip domains. This is followed by precise docking in the H1 and H2 regions to form the ®nal high-af®nity complex. The observed conformational plasticity in the H1 and H2 regions facilitates necessary structural rearrangements for the formation of the four-helix bundle in the ®nal protein complex. The color code used for the monomeric Myc protein is based on 13Ca,b chemical shift deviations from random coil values, ÁCa À ÁCb, and J(0) data (cf. Figures 6 and 8). Blue boxes denote the predicted a-helical regions within the bHLHZip domain of Max (cf. Figure 1).

were ligated. The expression plasmid pET3d-mycmax encodes the 105 amino acid residue p15v-myc and the 93 amino acid residue p14max proteins, simultaneously translated from a polycistronic mRNA containing ribosomal binding sites for each of the two coding regions (Figure 1(a)). The integrity of the coding regions of the three expression plasmids was veri®ed by nucleotide sequence analysis using a T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia).

penalty associated with heterodimerization. Similarly, the transient helical structure of the N-terminal region could act as a preorganized recognition motif for binding to the DNA consensus sequence CANNTG (E-box) (Blackwell et al., 1990; Prendergast & Ziff, 1991; Kerkhoff et al., 1991). The conformational plasticity observed for residues in the HLH motif may be important to optimize sidechain interactions in the four-helix bundle structure presumably formed upon binding to Max. The structural and dynamic features of v-Myc may represent a common theme for partially folded (apo-) bHLHZip transcription factors to meet the requirements for rapid and speci®c binding to their authentic protein partners by preformation of a recognition template mediating speci®city.

Expression and purification of recombinant Myc and Max Proteins The expression plasmid pET3d-mycmax was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. An overnight culture prepared in NZCYM was diluted 1:100 in minimal medium containing 4.8 g Na2HPO4, 3.0 g KH2PO4, 0.5 g NaCl, 0.75 g NH4Cl, 2.0 g glucose, 243 mg MgSO4, 100 mg ampicillin and 25 mg chloramphenicol per liter. Uniformly 13C/15N or 15N-labeling was performed in minimal medium containing [13C]glucose (CIL) and/or 15 NH4Cl (CIL), respectively, instead of the unlabeled components. Bacteria were grown at 30  C to an optical density of 0.55 at 600 nm, recombinant protein synthesis was induced by the addition of isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) to a ®nal concentration of 0.4 mM, and incubation was continued for ®ve hours. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4  C. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold buffer B (50 mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 pH 7.2, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA) per liter of the original bacterial culture. Bacteria were lysed by a freeze-thaw cycle. Polyethyleneimine was added to a ®nal concentration of 0.7 % (w/v). The clari®ed supernatant was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The precipitate formed between 35 % and 55 % saturation was dissolved and dialyzed into buffer A (50 mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA) and loaded onto a FPLC Mono S cation exchange column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer A. After washing with buffer A, proteins were eluted with a NaCl gradient generated by mixing buffers A and B. Equimolar amounts of Myc and Max eluted from the column in a single peak, indicating a heterodimeric protein complex. Myc  Max containing fractions were concentrated using a Centriprep-10 ultra®ltration ®lter (Amicon) and loaded onto a Superdex-75 gel ®ltration column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer A. Myc  Max containing fractions of the eluate were pooled, and protein concentration and purity were analyzed by photometry and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The ®nal yield of puri®ed equimolar Myc  Max proteins was approximately 4 mg per liter of bacterial culture. Homogeneous p15v-myc was isolated from the Myc  Max preparation under denaturing conditions by dialysis into buffer C (50 mM NaH2PO4, 200 mM NaCl, 7 M urea, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA) and chromatography on a Mono S cation exchange column equilibrated in the same buffer. Elution was performed with a pHgradient created by mixing buffer C and D (50 mM Na2HPO4, 200 mM NaCl, 7 M urea, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA). Protein from Myc containing fractions was completely renatured by dialysis into buffer E (50 mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 pH 6.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA). The native state of Myc was con®rmed by remixing with Max, yielding a protein complex with identical CD spectroscopic properties as the Myc  Max preparation. For NMR analysis, Myc was concentrated using Centricon-10 ®lters (Amicon). The ®nal yield of

Materials and Methods
Construction of pET expression plasmids encoding recombinant proteins p15v-myc, p14max, or both p15v-myc and p14max The 1.35 kb XbaI/EcoRI fragment of pEwtAB (Kerkhoff & Bister, 1991) was cloned into M13mp18 (New England Biolabs) predigested with XbaI/EcoRI. The oligonucleotide 5H -d(GTCGGCTCACCATGGTCAGCAACA)-3H corresponding to nucleotides 515-519 of pET3b (Studier et al., 1990) and 3008-3026 of MC29 proviral DNA (Reddy et al., 1983) was used to introduce nucleotide substitutions (underlined) generating a novel NcoI site (CH CATGG) and a start codon (ATG). The mutated plasmid was digested with NcoI and EcoRI, and the 1.26 kb fragment was ligated into expression plasmid pET3d (Studier et al., 1990) predigested with NcoI and EcoRI. The expression plasmid pET3d-p15myc encodes a 105 amino acid residue peptide termed p15v-myc encompassing the C-terminal 103 amino acids of v-Myc (corresponding to amino acid positions 314-416 in chicken c-Myc) and two additional N-terminal residues (Met, Val). A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using chicken max cDNA (kindly provided by E. Taparowsky, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana) as a template and the oligonucleotides 5H -d(CC AGTCCATGGCAGACAAACGAGCCCAC)-3H and 5H d(CTGGATCCTAGGCCTGCAGCTGGGCG)-3H as 5H and 3H primers, respectively. The 5H primer corresponds to nucleotides 54-81 of the chicken max coding region (Sollenberger et al., 1994) with nucleotide substitutions (underlined) introducing a novel NcoI site (CH CATGG) and a start codon (ATG). The 3H primer corresponds to the sequence complementary to nucleotides 324-349 of the chicken max coding region with nucleotide substitutions (underlined) introducing a stop codon (TAG) and a novel BamHI site (GH GATCC). The PCR product was digested with NcoI and BamHI. The 283 bp fragment was ligated into expression plasmid pET3d predigested with NcoI and BamHI. The expression plasmid pET3dp14max encodes a 93 amino acid residue peptide termed p14max encompassing amino acid residues 22-113 of chicken Max and an additional N-terminal residue (Met). Plasmid pET3d-p14max was digested with XbaI and EcoRV, and the 453 bp fragment was ligated to the EcoRV site of expression plasmid pET3d-p15myc predigested with BamHI and EcoRV. The 5H -overhangs were ®lled in by phage T4 DNA polymerase, and blunt ends

homogeneous v-Myc was approximately 2 mg per liter of bacterial culture. The bacterial expression and puri®cation of p14max was performed essentially as described for Myc  Max, except that BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria transformed by pET3d-max were grown to an optical density of 0.7 before induction and incubated for another 15 hours, bacteria were lysed by soni®cation, and precipitation with polyethyleneimine was omitted. The ®nal yield of homogeneous Max was approximately 42 mg per liter of bacterial culture. Mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing (performed by F. Lottspeich, Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany) con®rmed the identity and structural integrity of the recombinant proteins. Circular dichroism spectroscopy CD spectra were recorded on a spectropolarimeter (Jasco J-715) equipped with a thermostat (Jasco PTC-348 WI). The instrument was calibrated with an aqueous solution of 10-()-camphorsulfonic acid. Protein concentrations were determined by photometry at 280 nm (Gill & von Hippel, 1989). Samples containing 30 mM protein or 30 mM protein and 15 mM double-stranded oligonucleotide (5H -d(GTAGGCCACGTGACCGGG)-3H ) containing a consensus Myc/Max binding site (underlined) dissolved in a sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.5 mM DTT, adjusted to the desired pH) were analyzed using quartz cells of 1 mm path-length. Spectra were processed by subtracting buffer spectra or DNA spectra measured under the same conditions, and smoothing and normalizing to receive the mean residue ellipticity (Jasco J-700 software). Wavelength spectra were obtained by averaging three scans at 23  C recorded at 0.2 nm intervals from 190 to 250 nm at a rate of 20 nm minÀ1, a response time of eight seconds, and a bandwidth of 2.0 nm. Using 13 reference proteins, quantitative determination of secondary structure elements in Myc, Max, and Myc  Max protein preparations was achieved. Temperature scans were performed with a slope of 45  C hÀ1, and the ellipticity at 222 nm was recorded with a resolution of 0.2  C, a response time of eight seconds, and a bandwidth of 2.0 nm. The melting temperature of protein dimers corresponding to the reversal point of the temperature-induced reversible denaturation curves were determined by the second derivative. Thermodynamic data were calculated as follows: The helical content of a protein is directly proportional to the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm (Chen et al., 1972), and thermal denaturation curves, monitoring the ellipticity at 222 nm, represent the temperature-dependent a-helical content of a protein containing predominantely a-helices, like the bHLHZip domains in the Max homodimer and Myc-Max heterodimer recombinant protein preparations analyzed here. The helices are stabilized upon dimerization, and it can be assumed that the denaturation of the dimers follow a two-state model from the folded dimer to the unfolded monomer (Horiuchi et al., 1997). The dissociation constant of the unfolding reaction is: Kd  M2 aD 1

The Kd for the non-selfcomplementary Myc-Max dimer is:
2 Kd  1a2cM Â fM a1 À fM

cM is the total concentration of monomeric units and fM is the molar fraction of monomers. Analysis of the sigmoidal melting curves yields fM. The ellipticity of dimeric and monomeric states are linearly temperature dependent (Marky & Breslauer, 1987): yDaM T  yDaM 0  dyDaM TadT Â T 4

[y]D/M is the mean residue ellipticity of the dimer and the monomer, respectively. This linear function can be determined by ®tting the data points in the linear regions of the experimental melting curve. The temperature dependence of the dissociation reaction can be expressed in the terms: yT  1 À fM  Â yD T  fM Â yM T or: fM  yD T À yTayD T À yM T By insertion of the measured data [y](T) and the calculated functions [y]D/M(T) in equation (5), fM over the whole temperature region is obtained. Using fM in equations (2) and (3), respectively, leads to a temperature-dependent function of Kd. Consequently, the free energy of unfolding, ÁGd, de®ned as: ÁGd  ÀRT ln Kd 6 5

can be used to determine standard reaction enthalpy and entropy:
0 ÁGd  ÁHd  ÁCp T À T 0 

À TÁS0  ÁCp lnTaT 0  d

The standard temperature is set to the melting temperature T0. The results of the curve-®tting program for ÁH0 d and ÁS0 are used in the subsequent analysis. The calcud lated value of the heat capacity change (ÁCp) bears the largest standard deviation and is determined by a different method. For this purpose, melting curves were measured at various pH values and the enthalpy at the melting point was estimated as described above. ÁCp is considered to be temperature independent (Gomez et al., 1995) as well as pH independent (Privalov, 1979). So linear curve-®tting of the data points gives ÁCp (Shortle et al., 1988):
0 ÁCp  dÁHd adT

Using ÁH0 , ÁS0 and ÁCp in equation (7), ÁGd as a d d function of temperature at pH 7 was calculated for the Myc-Max heterodimeric and the Max homodimeric complexes. Calculation of the entropy of dimerization The total entropy change of protein dissociation, ÁSd, is speci®ed by: ÁSd T  ÁSHE T  ÁSrt  ÁSother

where D and M denote the protein in dimeric and monomeric form, respectively. Expressed in other terms, the Kd for the selfcomplementary Max-Max dimer is:

Structure, Function, and Dynamics of v-Myc where ÁSHE denotes the contribution of the hydrophobic effect, ÁSrt the contribution of the reduction of rotational and translational degrees of freedom on dimerization and ÁSother the contribution of other sources. ÁSd is zero at the temperature TS, and ÁSHE(TS) equals (ÀÁSother À ÁSrt). ÁSother and ÁSrt are assumed to be temperature independent and can thus be determined by the correlation: ÁSHE(TS)  À 1.34 ÁAnp ln(TS/386) [J KÀ1 molÀ1] (Spolar & Record, 1994). So, knowing TS and ÁAnp, ÁSd(T)  ÁSHE(T) À ÁSHE(TS) can be determined at any temperature. Additionally, the number of residues involved in the unfolding reaction can be estimated from ÁSother  23.4 R, where R is the number of residues. For ÁSrt, the statistical mechanical estimate of 209 J molÀ1 KÀ1 was used (Spolar & Record, 1994). For the calculation of the change in solvent exposure of non-polar surface areas, ÁAnp , an extended b-sheet was taken as model for the denatured state of Max and the unstructured regions of Myc, according to published methods (Spolar & Record, 1994). The partially folded region of Myc was approximated by an a-helical leucine zipper region comprising 28 residues. The X-ray structure of the Max2-DNA complex served as a model for the native states of Max-Max and Myc-Max, respectively, with corrections in the sequence for residues of Myc. As in the monomeric state, unstructured regions, as estimated by CD-spectroscopy, were modeled as extended b-sheets. Protein surfaces were determined by the proÊ gram MolMol (Koradi et al., 1996), assuming a 1.4 A radius for water molecules. The difference in solventaccessible surface between denatured and native states of polar residues (Cys, Asp, Glu, Lys, Pro and Arg) (Creighton, 1993) and of non-polar residues (remaining) were calculated. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined from binding curves generated by EMSA (Kerkhoff et al., 1991; Petersen et al., 1995; Hartl & Bister, 1998). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. The concentration of the 32P-end-labeled synthetic DNA duplex 5H -d(GTAGGCCACGTGACCGGG)-3H was determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. Proteins were incubated with DNA for 45 min at 23  C in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.6), 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 % (v/v) glycerol. The protein-DNA complexes were separated from the free DNA on a 6 % polyacrylamide gel (36.7:1 acrylamid:bisacrylamid) prepared and electrophoresed in a buffer containing 0.5 Â TBE (45 mM Tris-borate, 10 mM EDTA). Preelectrophoresis was performed at 200 V and 23  C for 45 minutes, electrophoresis for one hour under the same conditions. Free DNA and DNA-protein complexes were quanti®ed by phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. Data were ®tted to the equation bound DNA/ total DNA  [protein]2/([protein]2  Kd). In all binding reactions the DNA concentration was suf®ciently low (40 pM for Myc  Max and Max, and 4.0 nM for Myc) to ensure that free protein was approximately equal to total protein. NMR spectroscopy All spectra were recorded at 26  C on a Varian UNITY Plus 500-MHz spectrometer equipped with a pulse ®eld gradient unit and a triple resonance probe with actively

1407
shielded z gradients. The NMR sample contained 2 mM v-Myc bHLHZip domain protein uniformly labeled with 13 C and/or 15N in a mixture of buffer E and 2H2O (9:1; v/v). NMR spectra were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995), ANSIG (Kraulis et al., 1994), and NMRView (Johnson & Blevins, 1994) software. Two-dimensional 15N-HSQC and three-dimensional NMR experiments including HNCA (Kay et al., 1990; Grzesiek & Bax, 1992), HNCACB (Wittekind & Mueller, 1993; Muhandiram & Kay, 1994), HNCO (Kay et al., 1990, 1994; Grzesiek & Bax, 1992; Muhandiram & Kay, 1994), HNCACO (Clubb et al., 1992), and CC(CO)NH-TOCSY (Logan et al., 1993; Grzesiek et al., 1993) were recorded for signal assignment (Kay, 1995). Experimental parameters were as described (Konrat et al., 1998). All spectra were performed with water ¯ip-back pulse (Grzesiek & Bax, 1993; Stonehouse et al., 1994) and PFG sensitivity enhancement (Kay et al., 1992). The phases were set for States-TPPI acquisition in the indirect dimensions. A delay prior to t2 was set in order to achieve 180  linear phase correction in HNCACB, HNCO and CC(CO)NH-TOCSY. The CC(CO)NHTOCSY spectrum was performed using a DIPSI mixing sequence (Rucker & Shaka, 1989). Typical 3D spectra were recorded with 1024 points in the direct (1H) dimension, 32 to 50 complex data points in the ®rst indirect dimension (13C) and 23 to 32 complex data points in the second indirect dimension (15N). The 2D-15N-HSQC spectrum resulted from a 128 Â 1024 data matrix with 16 scans per t1 value. Spectral widths were 8000 Hz (16 ppm) for 1H, 1650 Hz (33 ppm) for 15N, 4000 Hz (32 ppm) for 13Ca, 7650 Hz (61 ppm) for 13Cab, and 1200 Hz (9.5 ppm) for 13CO. Data were doubled by linear prediction in the indirect dimensions and processed using shifted squared sine bells before zero-®lling and Fourier transformation. Complete backbone assignment (except 1 N H and 15N of the N-terminal Val residue) and complete assignment of 13C side-chain nuclei could be achieved. 1H and 13C signals were referenced on external DSS, respectively. Random coil chemical shifts were taken from Wishart (1995), with corrections for residues preceding prolines. A 3D-15N,15N-edited HSQC-NOESYHSQC (Zhang et al., 1994) spectrum was performed to obtain information on sequential 1HN(i)-1HN(i  1) NOEs. The spectrum was recorded with 1024 data points (8000 Hz) in the direct 1H dimension and 32 complex data points (1650 Hz) in the indirect dimensions and the mixing time was 150 ms. Dynamic information was obtained by measuring T1, T2, and the heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE (Farrow et al., 1994). Experimental parameters were as described (Kloiber et al., 1999). Relaxation delays were 0, 110, 220, 330, 440, 660, and 880 ms for T1, and 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 ms for T2 measurements, respectively. Relaxation times were obtained by measuring peak heights and using non-linear leastsquare ®tting with two adjustable parameters. Relaxation data are not available for Pro322, Pro359, and Pro368, and residues within high spectral overlay. Amide proton attenuation factors were measured by recording 15NHSQC and 3D HNCO spectra with and without water presaturation.
