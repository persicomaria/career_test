Abstract: The carbon monoxide complex of [NiFe]hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F has been characterized by X-ray crystallography and absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy. Nine crystal structures of the [NiFe]hydrogenase in the CO-bound and CO-liberated forms were determined at 1.2-1.4 Å resolution. The exogenously added CO was assigned to be bound to the Ni atom at the Ni-Fe active site. The CO was not replaced with H2 in the dark at 100 K, but was liberated by illumination with a strong white light. The Ni-C distances and Ni-C-O angles were about 1.77 Å and 160°, respectively, except for one case (1.72 Å and 135°), in which an additional electron density peak between the CO and S(Cys546) was recognized. Distinct changes were observed in the electron density distribution of the Ni and S(Cys546) atoms between the CO-bound and CO-liberated structures for all the crystals tested. The novel structural features found near the Ni and S(Cys546) atoms suggest that these two atoms at the Ni-Fe active site play a role during the initial H2-binding process. Anaerobic addition of CO to dithionitereduced [NiFe]hydrogenase led to a new absorption band at about 470 nm (3000 M-1cm-1). Resonance Raman spectra (excitation at 476.5 nm) of the CO complex revealed CO-isotope-sensitive bands at 375/ 393 and 430 cm-1 (368 and 413 cm-1 for 13C18O). The frequencies and relative intensities of the COrelated Raman bands indicated that the exogenous CO is bound to the Ni atom with a bent Ni-C-O structure in solution, in agreement with the refined structure determined by X-ray crystallography.

Introduction

Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible oxidation of molecular hydrogen and play a key role in hydrogen metabolism in various bacteria. Dihydrogen, the substrate and product of hydrogenases, is a good candidate for fuel in the future, since fossil fuels are a limited resource and considered to cause environmental disruption. The reaction mechanism of dihydrogen production by hydrogenases is potentially useful for development of new chemical engineering processes for hydrogen fuels, whereas that

of dihydrogen consumption is potentially applicable for new types of fuel cells. Hydrogenases are classified into several groups according to the metal composition of their active sites. So far, [nonmetal], [Fe], [NiFe], and [NiFeSe] hydrogenases have been identified. Among them, [NiFe]hydrogenases are the most widely investigated.1-7 The hydrogenase from DesulfoVibrio Vulgaris Miyazaki F is composed of a heterodimer with a total molecular mass of 91 kDa (R ) 62.5 kDa and ) 28.8 kDa). The active site of the [NiFe] hydrogenases in the oxidized form is composed of the Ni and Fe atoms with four cysteinyl sulfur and four nonprotein ligands (Figure 1).8 The nonprotein L1, L2, and L3

ligands bound to the Fe atom were assigned as SO, CN or CO, CN or CO, and CN or CO molecules, and a bridging ligand between the Ni and Fe atoms as S or SH, as the most probable candidates for the enzyme from D. V. Miyazaki. A CN or CO molecule, however, was also possible instead of the SO.8 In contrast, CO, CN, CN, and O or OH ligands were assigned in the respective ligand positions for the D. gigas enzyme.11,12 The two diatomic ligands of L1 and L2 in Figure 1 are hydrogenbonded to the side-chain atoms of Arg479 (Arg463 in D. gigas enzyme) and Ser502 (Ser486 in D. gigas enzyme), respectively. The bridging S or SH ligand between the Ni and Fe atoms in D. V. Miyazaki enzyme is liberated from the active site during the reductive activation process of the enzyme under the atmosphere of H2.13,14 Likewise, the bridging O/OH ligand in D. gigas enzyme is liberated during the reductive activation of the enzyme.15 Carbon monoxide (CO) was known as a reversible inhibitor of hydrogenases in earlier enzymatic studies.16-20 The H2 evolution activity of the [NiFe]hydrogenase from D. V. Miyazaki decreased as the partial pressure of CO was increased, whereas the original activity recovered upon flushing out CO with a stream of N2.21 The data from spectroscopic studies have suggested that CO binds to the Ni atom at the active site for [NiFe]hydrogenase from Chromatium Vinosum.22-24 Introduction of 13CO caused a 2-fold superhyperfine splitting of its Ni EPR spectrum, which demonstrates that one CO molecule

directly binds to the Ni atom in an axial position.24 The C-O stretching (CO) IR band, which has been detected for the CO complex of the C. Vinosum [NiFe]hydrogenase, showed that the CO ligand is photolabile at cryogenic temperature but could rebind to restore the original CO complex at temperatures above 200 K.25 An EPR study also indicated that the CO-bound species appeared only after thawing the CO-photodissociated species under a CO atmosphere.23 Presteady-state kinetics of the reactions of the C. Vinosum enzyme with H2 and CO revealed that the S ) 1/2, EPR-detectable state (one electron oxidized from the fully reduced state) was induced from the fully reduced state after 11 ms by replacing H2 with CO.26 In addition, a linear coordination mode of an exogenous CO to the Ni atom was suggested by a recent X-ray absorption spectroscopic study on the C. Vinosum enzyme.27 The characteristics of the CO-complex of the [Fe]hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum have been studied in detail by EPR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.28,29 While various lines of evidence indicated that the extrinsic CO interacts with the Ni atom of [NiFe]hydrogenase, they were not entirely conclusive, given the heterobinulcear nature of the active site and the intimate communication between the two metals. In this study, we present the first direct evidence of CO coordination to the Ni atom of D. V. Miyazaki [NiFe]hydrogenase by X-ray crystallography and optical absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy. Some novel features of the electron density distribution were observed at the active site of the CO-bound and CO-liberated forms in the crystal structures at 1.20-1.40 Å resolution. The possible initial reaction site for H2 is also discussed.
Experimental Section
Enzyme Purification. Isolation and purification of the oxidized [NiFe]hydrogenase from D. V. Miyazaki F was carried out according to the protocol described previously.30 A solution of the enzyme was concentrated to about 1 mM using a Centricon-30 filter and stored at 77 K for later use. 12C16O (Nippon Sanso, 99.95 atom %, O2 less than 75 ppm), 13C18O (ICON, 99 atom % for 13C and 95 atom % for 18O), and H2 (Nippon Sanso, 99.9999 atom %, O2 less than 0.1 ppm) were used. X-ray Crystallographic Analysis. Crystallization of the oxidized enzyme was achieved by using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method as described previously.30 Methyl viologen (final concentration ) 1 mM) was added to the protein droplets in order to reduce the crystalline enzyme under the H2 atmosphere. The crystal space group is P212121, and the unit cell parameters are shown in Table 1. Diffraction data were collected at 1.20-1.40 Å resolution with the use of Rigaku R-AXIS IV and MAR-CCD detector systems at the SPring-8 beamlines BL-44B2 and BL-41XU (Hyogo, Japan). When the CCD detector was used, diffraction data sets in the low and high-resolution ranges were

Nine structures in a series of CO-related [NiFe] hydrogenase using three crystals (Crystal-A, -B, and -C) from D. V. Miyazaki have been successfully determined, here the CO-related structures refer to the structures of the enzyme once exposed to CO, regardless of whether the CO was kept bound on the enzyme or removed by subsequent treatments. A sample preparation scheme is diagrammatically shown in Figure 2.

with CO in a glass capillary tube. Diffraction data sets of the COintroduced structures were collected under dark conditions. Three CObound structures in their initial states after CO introduction in the dark are termed as ACOD (A for crystal-A and the subscription D for the dark), BCOD (crystal-B), and CCOD (crystal-C). Crystal-A was incubated with H2 for 1 h after data collection of ACOD and was exposed to the X-ray beam in the dark (ACOHD). After the data collection of BCOD, the second data set was collected in the weakly lit ambient room light (BCOLW, the subscription LW), followed by the third data set under a strong light at a distance of 50 mm from the crystal (BCOLS, the subscription LS). Immediately after the data collection of CCOLS, the CO gas was replaced with H2 and the final diffraction data set of CCOHLS was collected under continuous illumination of a strong white light. Diffraction data images were indexed with the program DENZO31 or MOSFLM,32 and processed using SCALA in the CCP4 package.33 All nine structures have been refined at a resolution of 1.2-1.4 Å with R-values (free R-values) between 0.11 and 0.14 (0.15-0.19), using the program package CNS34 followed by SHELXL.35 During the SHELXL refinement, anisotropic temperature factors were introduced for the nonsolvent atoms in the protein molecule and the metal centers, except for the BCOD structure, in which all the atoms were treated with anisotropic thermal motion. The nonprotein ligands, both the intrinsic diatomic ligands of the Fe atom in its native state and the exogenously added CO molecule, were refined without any stereochemical restraint in order to obtain the real features of the coordination geometry. The occupation factors of the exogenous CO ligand were refined at the final stage of the SHELXL refinement. The details of the refinement statistics of four out of nine structures are also listed in Table 1. Spectroscopic Measurements. Optical absorption spectra of the [NiFe]hydrogenase in various states (oxidized, H2-reduced, reoxidized, rereduced, and CO-added) were recorded at 288 K with a Shimadzu

(A) Fo-Fc maps of ACOD obtained under dark, (B) BCOD under dark, (C) BCOLS under illumination of a strong white light, and (D) CCOD under dark. All structures were prepared under the CO atmosphere. The atoms shown in a ball-and-stick model were omitted in the calculation of the omit maps. Omit and residual maps are colored in gray and black, respectively. The Ni and S (Cys546) atoms and the exogenous CO molecule are shown in black, whereas others in gray. All intrinsic diatomic ligands at L1, L2, and L3 sites are tentatively assigned as CO. Note that COI and COII ligands in our previous reports8,13 correspond to L3 and L2, respectively. The figures were prepared using the program O.37

UV-3100PC spectrophotometer. Their difference spectra were calculated to eliminate the influence of the absorption of the protein moiety. The resonance Raman scattering of the CO complex of [NiFe]hydrogenase was excited at 476.5 nm with an Ar+ ion laser (Spectra Physics, 2070) and detected at ambient temperature with a CCD (Princeton Instruments) attached to a triple polychromator (JASCO, NR-1800). The CO-bound [NiFe]hydrogenase was obtained by first reducing the oxidized hydrogenase with dithionite under H2 atmosphere and then transferring the solution with a gastight syringe to the Raman cell filled with 12C16O or 13C18O.

Results

Refined Structure. The overall folding pattern of the mainchain and the location of the metal centers were almost identical among all nine structures. The root-mean-square distances of the main-chain atoms calculated between any two structures in the same crystal were all within 0.12 Å, whereas those from different crystals were within 0.30 Å.36 The size of the electron density of the L1 ligand, which was previously reported as SO in the oxidized and H2-reduced forms,8,13 was too small to assign an SO molecule in all the structures in this study. All Fe-CO angles appeared nearly linear after a few cycles of SHELXL refinement, and the coordination distances were between 1.7

and 2.0 Å. Consequently, it was difficult to specify the molecular species of the diatomic ligands based on the results in the highest-resolution structural analysis available at present. The Ni-Fe distance (2.61-2.62 Å) did not show any distinct changes on interaction of exogenous CO. Binding Site for the Extrinsic CO. In the refined structure of the CO-bound [NiFe]hydrogenases (ACOD, ACOHD, BCOD, BCOLW, CCOD, and CCOLW), the added CO was found to coordinate to the Ni atom and not to the Fe atom at the Ni-Fe active site (Figures 3A, 3B, and 3D). The Ni-C distances of the extrinsic CO molecules were 1.76-1.78 Å, and the NiC-O were about 160° in BCOD, BCOLW, CCOD, and CCOLW structures. On the other hand, the CO-bound structures in Crystal-A showed a little different features (Ni-C ) 1.72 Å and Ni-C-O ) 135° for ACOD). The occupation factor of the added CO was refined to 0.80 (ACOD), 0.89 (ACOHD), 0.96 (BCOD), 0.91 (BCOLW), 0.93 (CCOD), and 0.83 (CCOLW), respectively. The CO molecule, however, was hardly detectable in the initial 2FO-FC maps of the BCOLS, CCOLS, and CCOHLS structures, and it was impossible to refine the atomic parameters of the C and O atoms of a CO during the refinement.

and 4 in the residual FO-FC electron density maps around the Ni-Fe active site of the CO-related structures. One site was the exogenous CO site. All CO-liberated structures (BCOLS, CCOLS, and CCOHLS) showed a small residual electron density peak at this site in both the omitted and residual electron density maps due to a trace of an exogenous CO (Figure 3C). As mentioned above, however, it was not possible to refine the atomic parameters of the fitted CO molecule at this site. The omitted and residual maps of the ACOD and ACOHD structures showed one peak at the site between the exogenous CO and side-chain atoms (C and S) of Cys546 (Figure 3A), whereas the structures in Crystal-B and -C did not show any explicit electron density peak at this site in either the omitted or residual FO-FC maps except for CCOLW. Instead, the electron density peaks of the C and S atoms, however, extended toward the exogenous CO (Figure 3B). The BCOD (Figure 3B), BCOLW, BCOLS (Figure 3C), CCOD (Figure 3D), CCOLW, and CCOLS structures had another isolated peak at the site where the bridging sulfur ligand had been located in the oxidized form of the D. V. Miyazaki enzyme. The residual maps of the CCOD (Figure 3D) and CCOLW structures had an additional density peak between Cys81 and Cys84. The ACOHD, BCOD (Figure 3B), CCOD (Figure 3D), CCOLW, and CCOLS structures had one more extra density peak near the S atom of Cys546. This extra density was significant and located at a distance of covalent-bond length from S(Cys546) in both the omitted and residual maps in the CCOD (marked X in Figure 3D), CCOLW, and CCOLS structures. This density peak disappeared on introducing H2 under illumination of a strong white light in the structure of CCOHLS. Except for this accompanying density peak, the structures of crystal C were essentially identical with

those of crystal B. The origin and the nature of the accompanying peak will be dealt with elsewhere. In addition to the omitted and residual FO-FC maps, FO-FO maps were calculated between the data sets of two different states in the same crystal. All sets of FO-FO maps calculated between the CO-bound and CO-liberated forms exhibited a common feature; that is, there were two isolated electron density peaks (shown in black and gray) around the Ni and S(Cys546) atoms (Figure 4B: FOBCOD-FOBCOLS). In contrast, no distinct feature could be recognized in the maps between any two CObound (e.g. between the ACOD and ACOHD structures shown in Figure 4A) or CO-liberated structures. On coordination of the exogenous CO to the Ni atom, S(Cys546) shifted away 0.2-0.3 Å from the original position. Other atoms comprising the Ni-Fe active site were also shifted to some extent, but only the electron density distributions of the Ni and S(Cys546) atoms were strongly affected. There was no distinct change in the electron density distribution around the Fe atom or its intrinsic diatomic ligands in any of the FO-FO maps. Optical Absorption Spectra.

Experimental conditions: excitation, 476.5 nm, 50 mW at the sample; sample, 80 µM enzyme in 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6; ambient temperature.

resulted in a decrease in the intensity of the absorption band around 425 nm (Figure 5A), due to the reduction of the Fe-S clusters in the enzyme. The increase in the 470-nm band was time-dependent and saturated only after 6 h incubation under the CO atmosphere (Figure 5B). The absorption coefficient of the new band at 470 nm was estimated to be about 3000 M-1cm-1. A slight wavelength shift of the 470-nm band was concurrent with the decrease of the absorption around 425 nm, due to the gradual reduction of the remaining nonreduced enzyme by dithionite even after introducing CO. We attribute the new absorption band to the CO-bound complex of the reduced D. V. Miyazaki [NiFe]hydrogenase, because the wavelengths of the new absorption band was different from those of the oxidized Fe-S clusters, and the exogenous CO was shown to bind to the Ni atom in the crystal structures. Resonance Raman Spectra. Several bands were detected in the resonance Raman spectra excited at 476.5 nm in resonance to the new absorption band (Figure 6, curves a and b), which had not been observed in the resonance Raman spectrum of the oxidized enzyme (Figure 6, curve d). Two CO-isotopesensitive bands at 375 and 393 cm-1 were observed for the 12C16O complex due to Fermi resonance, which fused to one band at 368 cm-1 when 13C18O was used. Another band at 430 cm-1 for the 12C16O-bound enzyme shifted to 413 cm-1 on incubation with 13C18O. The shifts of these bands are clearly seen in the difference spectrum (Figure 6, curve c), while no significant frequency shift is observed in any of the other bands. Since the intensity of the Ni-C stretching (NiC) band is expected to be higher than that of the Ni-C-O bending (NiCO) band, the bands at 375/393 and 430 cm-1 are tentatively assigned to the NiC and NiCO Raman bands, respectively. The CO-isotope frequency shift for the NiC band agreed with the value estimated by using the equation for a classical harmonic oscillator. The frequencies and their isotopic shifts in the resonance Raman spectra were also in parallel with those observed for nickel carbonyl: the NiC band at 380 cm-1 of Ni(CO)4 shifted to 376 cm-1 in Ni(13CO)4 and to 361 cm-1 in Ni(C18O)4, and the antisymmetric NiC band (423 cm-1) was observed at a lower frequency than the antisymmetric NiCO band (455 cm-1).38

The overall structural features of the CO-bound and COliberated structures of the D. V. Miyazaki [NiFe]hydrogenase obtained from three crystals were essentially the same, confirming the reproducibility of the analyses, but some differences were recognized near the Ni-Fe site that is assumed to be the active site in the catalytic process to bind H2. The results of the present work also reconfirmed the established structures reported in our earlier works8,14 except in one point. The diatomic L1 ligand was refined to be a SO molecule in our previous works, 8,14 and a CO molecule in the present work. As L1 ligand is buried in the protein moiety and the structural features around the Fe atom with its ligands did not change during the CObinding and CO-liberating cycles, it must be concluded that the crystals used in the present study had a CO (or CN) ligand at L1 site. The reasons of the discrepancy are not readily explainable, but one possibility is that the molecular species of the diatomic ligands of the Fe atom may be heterogeneous among the molecules. Heterogeneous features at the active site has been reported in the structural study of the [Fe]hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum.39 Characteristics of the NiCO Site. Carbon monoxide, an inhibitor of the [NiFe]hydrogenase from D. Vulgaris Miyazaki, was found to be bound to the Ni atom at the Ni-Fe site of the enzyme. Another case of CO binding to the Ni atom in a protein molecule has been reported for the Ni-Fe-S carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, 40 of which CO is a substrate rather than an inhibitor. The ACOHD structure showed a CO-bound form, suggesting that most of the CO fractions in the Crystal-A remained at their coordination site in the dark at 100 K even in the H2 atmosphere. The low temperature used for data collection might have hindered the CO liberation from the Ni atom, since CO association is known to be temperature-dependent. The occupation factors and the sizes of the electron density peaks of CO (BCOD and CCOD) diminished after illumination with a weak light (BCOLW and CCOLW). The exogenous CO ligand was almost liberated by illumination of a strong white light as shown in the BCOLS and CCOLS structures, leaving the intrinsic CO/ CN ligands of the Fe atom in the Ni-Fe site unaffected (Table 2). These results suggest that illumination with a strong white light is more effective to remove the coordinated CO from the Ni atom than to replace CO with H2 in the capillary tube at 100 K. The Ni-C distances of the extrinsic CO molecules are about 1.77 Å except for the ACOD structure (Table 2) and are similar to the typical coordination distances of CO binding to the Ni atom found in some Ni-CO complexes, e.g., the Ni-C distance of Ni(II) thiolate-CO complex being 1.75 Å.41 However, the Ni-CO unit showed a bent conformation in all the CO-bound [NiFe]hydrogenase structures in this study. The range of NiC-O angles, 136.2 to 160.9°, seems to imply existence of

several coordination modes (Table 2). The sizes and shapes of the electron density peaks are also different among the CObound structures. The coordination distances of the exogenous CO molecule to the Ni atom (1.77-1.78 Å) found in this highresolution X-ray crystal structures were well in accordance with the value obtained by XAS experiment (1.78 Å).27 However, the bent Ni-C-O structure was not in agreement with the results by XAS experiment.27 A new absorption band was detected at 470 nm for the CObound [NiFe]hydrogenase (Figure 5B), whereas the absorption of a CO complex of a Ni model compound ([PPN][Ni(CO)(SePh)3]) with max at 419 ( ) 1979 M-1cm-1) has been reported previously.42 Detection of exogenous CO-related Raman bands by excitation at 476.5 nm in resonance to the new CO-related absorption band strongly supported the assignment of the absorption band at about 470 nm to a CT band caused by coordination of the exogenous CO to the Ni atom. In the Raman spectra, the bending mode would not appear if Ni-C-O was linear. The relatively high intensity of the NiCO band as compared to the NiC band should be due to the bent structure of the Ni-CO unit in solution as shown by the crystal structures. The CO frequency of the exogenous CO has been observed at 2060 cm-1 for the CO complex of [NiFe]hydrogenase from C. Vinosum,23 which was about 30 cm-1 higher than the CO frequencies of Ni(I)- and Ni(II)-CO model compounds (2023-2029) cm-1.41,43,44 Similarly, the CO band of the

exogenous CO for the CO complex of [NiFe]hydrogenase from D. fructosoVorans has been observed at 2055-2056 cm-1.45 The relatively high CO frequency demonstrates a weaker  back-bonding from the filled d orbital of the Ni atom to CO in the CO complex of the [NiFe]hydrogenase, which is consistent with the relatively low NiC frequency of the CO-bound [NiFe]hydrogenase. Activation Site for H2. CO has been known to be a reversible and competitive inhibitor of [NiFe]hydrogenase. The facts that the exogenously added CO was coordinated to the Ni instead of the Fe atom and was liberated by a strong white light even at 100K in all CO-related structures imply that the substrate H2 binds to the Ni atom (Figure 7). In addition, some novel structural features, which are described below, were found at the Ni-Fe active site in the series of the CO-related structures. These findings support the significant role of the Ni atom and the possible contribution of the S(Cys546) atom for the catalytic reaction of the enzyme. The most noteworthy characteristic is the distinct changes in the electron density distribution at the Ni and S(Cys546) atoms between CO-bound and CO-liberated structures of all crystals, which were recognized in the Fo-Fo maps (Figures 4B). The changes suggest that the Ni and S(Cys546) atoms are the most flexible sites during the CO-inhibition and reactivation processes of the enzyme. This is reasonable for the Ni atom, because the extrinsic CO molecule directly interacts with the Ni atom. The second feature at the Ni-Fe active site is an additional electron density peak found between CO and S(Cys546) in the ACOD structure. The distance of 2.80 Å between the C atom of the CO and the S(Cys546) atom in ACOD was larger than the corresponding distances (2.5-2.7 Å) in other CO-bound structures. The existence of the significant electron density (larger than 4) might be indicative of the presence of some molecular species sandwiched or trapped between these atoms in ACOD, which could be interpreted as the capture of an intermediate of the catalytic reaction. In addition, the temperature factor of the S(Cys546) atom was considerably larger than those of other liganding cysteine S atoms in all structures, as well as for the oxidized and reduced structures reported previously.8,13 The accompanying electron density peak found in Crystal-C and the distinguished high temperature factor of the S(Cys546) atom strongly indicate that this is the most reactive site among all liganding sulfurs. The S(Cys546) atom thus probably participates in the catalytic reaction at the active site. Another possible explanation for the high B-value of S(Cys546) is that this sulfur atom may be hydrogenated, which would imply that the hydrogenation of the atom is essential for the catalytic reaction.5,11,46-53 An additional interesting point is that the sulfur atom of Cys546 is replaced by a selenium atom in the [NiFeSe] hydrogenases found in some sulfate-reducing bacteria.54-56

the reaction by, for example, stabilizing the electronic states of the active site. In fact, the stereochemical parameters, the NiFe distance, the coordination distances, and the angles of the intrinsic diatomic ligands (all tentatively assigned as CO) of Fe did not change significantly among all structures on interaction with the exogenous CO molecule (Table 2). However, this does not rule out a possibility that the Fe atom and its moiety are related with the successive catalytic reaction after the initial activation. Actually, the Ni-H--Fe intermediates are proposed after the heterolysis of a H2.11,13,47-52

Considering the structural features found in this study, we propose that the Ni and S(Cys546) atoms play a role during the initial H2 activation process at the Ni-Fe active site. The Fe atom and its accessory ligands are probably not involved in the initial activation process but could have a role in controlling

The exogenous CO was shown to coordinate to the Ni atom in a bent form by high-resolution X-ray crystal structure analysis. The Ni-C distances and Ni-C-O angles were about 1.77 Å and 160°, respectively, except for one case found in Crystal-A (1.72 Å and 135°). The coordinating CO molecule was not replaced with H2 in the dark, but liberated by illumination of a strong white light at 100 K. The Fo-Fo maps calculated between the CO-bound and CO-liberated structures in each crystal showed a distinct change in the electron density distribution at the sites of S(Cys546) and Ni, suggesting that they are the most flexible sites on interaction with exogenous CO. The coordination geometry of the intrinsic diatomic ligands of Fe or Ni-Fe distance did not show any distinct change on interaction with the exogenous CO. The CO-bound structure in Crystal-A showed an additional electron density peak between the CO and S(Cys546). The temperature factor of the S(Cys546) atom was considerably larger than those of other liganding cysteine S atoms in all structures, also implicating that it is the most reactive ligand and possibly the hydrogenation site during the catalytic reaction. The novel structural features found near the Ni and S(Cys546) atoms in the series of the CO-related structures suggest that these two atoms at the NiFe active site play a role during the initial H2 activation process by the [NiFe]hydrogenase. A new CT band at 470 nm was observed when CO was introduced to the reduced enzyme. The absorption coefficient of this new 470 nm band was estimated to be about 3000 M-1cm-1. Resonance Raman spectra of the CO-bound [NiFe]hydrogenase exhibited a peak at 375/393 and 430 cm-1 for the 12C16O complex which shifted to 368 and 413 cm-1, respectively, for the 13C18O complex. They are assigned to NiC and NiCO modes, respectively. The relatively high magnitude of the NiCO band over the NiC band suggested a significant bent structure for the Ni-CO unit, which is consistent with the crystallographic structure. Acknowledgment.
