ABSTRACT: Hydrogen-exchange rates were measured for RNase T1 and three variants with Ala f Gly substitutions at a solvent-exposed (residue 21) and a buried (residue 23) position in the helix: A21G, G23A, and A21G + G23A. These results were used to measure the stabilities of the proteins. The hydrogenexchange stabilities (GHX) for the most stable residues in each variant agree with the equilibrium conformational stability measured by urea denaturation (GU), if the effects of D2O and proline isomerization are included [Huyghues-Despointes, B. M. P., Scholtz, J. M., and Pace, C. N. (1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. 6, 210-212]. These residues also show similar changes in GHX upon Ala f Gly mutations (GHX) as compared to equilibrium measurements (GU), indicating that the most stable residues are exchanging from the globally unfolded ensemble. Alanine is stabilizing compared to glycine by 1 kcal/ mol at a solvent-exposed site 21 as seen by other methods for the RNase T1 protein and peptide helix [Myers, J. K., Pace, C. N., and Scholtz, J. M. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94, 3833-2837], while it is destabilizing at the buried site 23 by the same amount. For the A21G variant, only local NMR chemical shift perturbations are observed compared to RNase T1. For the G23A variant, large chemical shift changes are seen throughout the sequence, although X-ray crystal structures of the variant and RNase T1 are nearly superimposable. Ala f Gly mutations in the helix of RNase T1 at both helical positions alter the native-state hydrogen-exchange stabilities of residues throughout the sequence.

It has been known for many years that the hydrogen exchange of amide groups in a protein with solvent water can vary by many orders of magnitude (1). A surface residue exchanges readily with the solvent, while an interior and/or hydrogen-bonded residue may not exchange unless the protein unfolds to a partially or globally unfolded form. A general two-step model for hydrogen exchange can be described by

using the measured kex values and the krc values based on peptide models of Bai et al. (2). How the hydrogen-exchange rates of individual groups relate to the global conformational stability and the folding process is less clear. Several groups have explored this relationship by measuring the response of hydrogen-exchange rates to protein denaturant (3-9), temperature (4, 10, 11), pressure (12), or mutation (13-15). The analysis of the dependence of external perturbants typically requires that the exchange rate constants be converted to stabilities using eq 2. Thus, the krc for unstructured peptides must be used. In contrast, the change in stability upon mutation, GHX, can be obtained directly from the hydrogen-exchange rate constants by

for all residues except at the mutation site and for the residue (i + 1) from this site where the krc values do not cancel. Many studies suggest that the most stable residues exchange through the unfolded protein ("global"), the residues with intermediate stabilities exchange by fluctuations in the native state ("local") or by partial unfolding ("subglobal"), and the least stable residues exchange directly with

Huyghues-Despointes et al. previously that RNase T1 is a good protein to measure the helix propensities of amino acids in a natural system. The sequence of the helix (residues 13-29) is SSDVSTAQAAGYKLHED. Alanine 21 is a completely exposed residue in the center of the helix and seems to make no contacts with other residues. Glycine 23 is on the buried face of the helix and packs against -sheets 3 and 4 of the protein. A peptide with the wild-type sequence shows a CD spectrum characteristic of a random-coil conformation. However, if glycine 23 is replaced with alanine, the resulting peptide is helical. This mutation allowed Myers et al. (22-24) to investigate helix propensities of amino acids at site 21 in RNase T1 and in a helical peptide of identical sequence. We present here an analysis of NMR chemical shifts of the variants and the X-ray crystal structure of G23A. The native-state hydrogen exchange of RNase T1 and three variants (A21G, G23A, and A21G + G23A) are then measured and compared to equilibrium unfolding measurements to identify global-exchanging residues. Last, we compare the effect of mutation on the global residues and nonglobal residues. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Mutagenesis and Protein Purification. RNase T1 and the Ala f Gly variants were produced previously (22) by sitedirected mutagenesis using the polymerase chain reaction (25). The proteins were expressed in the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli by using the pHN1+ and PJF118EH expression vectors for G23A and A21G + G23A variants and the pMC-RT1 vector for RNase T1 and the A21G variant. The 15N-labeled proteins were produced by transforming the plasmids in the E. coli strain MQ by electroporation. The cells were grown first in unlabeled M9 minimal media to a maximum density and then spun down and resuspended in M9 minimal media with 15N-NH4Cl. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG, and the cells were harvested after a single doubling period. The mutants were purified as described previously (26). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to confirm the protein purity. All mutations resulted in stable, active ribonucleases. Urea Denaturation. The conformational stability of RNase T1 and the variants was determined in D2O using urea denaturation as monitored by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. The deuterated urea (Sigma Ultrapure or Nacalai Tesque) was prepared by several cycles of lyophilization from D2O. The stock solutions of urea were prepared fresh daily and their concentrations were determined by refractive index measurements (27). Protein stock solutions were prepared in D2O in 50 mM sodium acetate at pD 7.4 or 7.7 for RNase T1 and pD 7.4 for the variants. pD is the addition of 0.4 to the pH meter reading when the sample is in D2O (28). After equilibration of protein samples for 16 h at 25 °C, urea denaturation curves were determined by measuring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence intensity at 320 nm after excitation at 278 nm with an SLM AB2 or SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer. A minimum of three denaturation curves was performed for each variant. Hydrogen Exchange by NMR Spectroscopy. Samples were prepared by dissolving the protein (1.5-2.0 mM) in H2O and 50 mM sodium acetate and allowed to equilibrate at 25 °C for 16 h. The protein sample was then exchanged into

the solvent in the native state (13, 15, 16). One interesting question that remains is whether the global residues identified by using eqs 2 or 3 are the same. The conformational stabilities calculated by hydrogenexchange rate constants of the most protected residues using eq 2 are often greater than the global conformational stability measured by traditional methods. This has led to controversies about the nature of the exchange process of these residues and whether the peptide-based krc values adequately model hydrogen exchange in proteins (17-19). Only recently has this difference been shown to result from the D2O solvent isotope effect and proline isomerization for many proteins (20). There are two relevant points to consider. First, proteins may be more or less stable in D2O than in H2O. It is important therefore to only compare hydrogen exchange and equilibrium unfolding stabilities that have been determined in D2O. Second, the cis/trans conformation of a Xaa-Pro bond in a protein is different under native-state conditions than under equilibrium unfolding conditions. The Xaa-Pro bond in the native state is primarily in one conformation, while the Xaa-Pro bond in the equilibrium unfolded state is a mixture of cis and trans conformations. The unfolded protein contains 6-38% of the cis conformation depending on the identity of Xaa (21). Since native-state hydrogen exchange occurs much faster than the time it takes for proline isomerization, a difference in free energy between hydrogenexchange and traditional measurements equaling the free energy of proline isomerization is observed. When these two effects are included, it appears that the most protected backbone amide hydrogens exchange only after global unfolding and the exchange of the unfolded state is modeled well by the peptide-based krc values of Bai et al. (2). Thus, the conformational stability can be determined adequately from hydrogen-exchange rates using eq 2 for the most stable residues in most proteins. RNase T1 is used here as a model system to examine hydrogen-exchange stabilities as a function of mutation. RNase T1 is a small (104 residues) R + protein where the -sheets pack against a 17 residue R-helix to form the hydrophobic core (Figure 1). It shows reversible two-state unfolding with denaturant and temperature. It has been shown

D2O and 50 mM deuterated sodium acetate (Isotec) using a spin column (Isolab Inc.). The protein sample was immediately placed in the NMR spectrometer with the probe temperature at 25 °C. NMR spectra were collected over time with a 500 MHz Varian Unity spectrometer, equipped with a triple resonance probe. 15N-1H HSQC spectra were recorded with 4-8 transients of 1024 data points and 256 T1 increments with sweep widths of 7002.8 and 2080 Hz in the 1H and 15N dimensions. Water suppression by presaturation was used. 15N-1H HSQC spectra were obtained over various time intervals (2 weeks to 6 months depending on the pH and the stability of the variant). The spectra were processed by nmrPipe and visualized by nmrDraw (29). Cross-peak intensities of the 15N-1H HSQC spectra for each variant were measured by volume integration using nmrDraw. Peak intensities were then fit to a singleexponential function, A ) A0[e(-kt)] + C, where C is baseline noise of a particular sample. The errors of hydrogenexchange free energies did not exceed 0.3 kcal/mol, determined using the 67% confidence interval on the error of the rate constants calculated by NONLIN (30). The errors were the largest for residues whose hydrogen-exchange rates were either very fast or very slow. The intrinsic exchange rates for residues in random coil peptides were calculated (2), using the appropriate temperature and pH with corrections for the known pKa values for the histidine residues (31). Since limited chemical shift perturbations for A21G variant were seen, the assignments of the 15N-1H HSQC spectra were

made by direct comparison to RNase T1 spectrum (32). Standard sequential assignment techniques were used to assign ambiguous peaks in the G23A and G23A + A21G variants. Two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY (tm ) 70 ms), TOCSY (70 ms), and COSY spectra were used for assignments, using the published RNase T1 spectra as a reference (33). Crystallization, Structure Determination, and Refinement of RNase T1 G23A. We obtained crystals of G23A mutant in complex with the specific inhibitor 2-GMP using the hanging drop technique aided by macroseeding. Data were collected from single needle-shaped crystals with typical dimensions 0.60 × 0.04 × 0.03 mm using a MAR Image Plate detector and a RIGAKU Rotating anode X-ray generator operated at 40 kV, 90 mA. The data were indexed as orthorhombic resulting in space group P212121, integrated using DENZO (34) and subsequently scaled and merged using SCALEPACK (35). The CCP4 program TRUNCATE (34) was used to convert intensities into structure factors. The structure of the G23A mutant was solved starting from the refined coordinates of the isomorphous wild-type structure PDB entry 1rga (36) stripped of all its solvent and inhibitor molecules. Refinement was done with X-PLOR version 3.851 (37) using all reflections in the resolution range 15.0-1.95 Å. The refinement was started with a slow cool stage to reduce bias toward the starting model. A bulk solvent correction was calculated after each rebuilding session.

RESULTS Chemical Shift and Crystal Structure Analysis. A comparison of 15N-1H HSQC spectra of RNase T1 with the A21G and G23A variants is shown in Figure 2, and the changes in chemical shift (in hertz) as a function of residue position for the single mutants relative to RNase T1 are shown in Figure 3. The chemical shifts of residues in the solventexposed A21G variant (green) and RNase T1 (blue) are

nearly identical, except near the mutation site (Figure 2). The change in chemical shift of Ala22 is largest, and smaller changes for other residues in the helix (Gln20, Tyr24, Lys25, and His27) are observed. Residues outside of the helix are essentially not affected by the A21G mutation. In contrast, the cross-peaks for the G23A variant (red) display large changes in chemical shifts compared to RNase T1 (blue) for residues throughout the entire protein (Figure 2). In the helix, the chemical shifts of residues that are (i,i(4) (Ala19 and His27) and (i,i(3) (Gln20 and Leu26) from the substitution site show the largest changes (Figure 3B). The -strand residues near site 23, such as Trp59, Phe80, Tyr57, and Tyr68, and their neighboring residues (Val79, Val78, and Glu58) are also affected by the mutation. We observe small changes in chemical shift for residues outside the region of the mutation. We also obtained the X-ray crystal structure of the G23A variant to compare the structure to RNase T1. The crystallization conditions for G23A were identical to the conditions used to determine the RNase T1 wild-type structure (40). The crystallographic data for the G23A variant are shown in Table 1, and the RMSD (Å) for the backbone amide nitrogens is shown in Figure 3C. The deviation in the overall backbone amide nitrogen RMSD is 0.2 Å, and the RMSD for all atoms in the backbone is 0.42 Å. The changes in NMR chemical shifts and in backbone nitrogen RMSD are consistent; variations in G23A are seen mainly in the helix and near the mutation site in -sheets 3 and 4. The chemical shift changes are, however, more pronounced and sensitive to the mutation. The structure of G23A is nearly super-

Small differences are observed in the backbone helical residues near the mutation site and in side-chain conformations of Trp59, Phe80, and the C-terminal residues of the helix (Figure 4B). Urea Denaturation. The effect of mutations on the conformational stability of RNase T1 was determined using equilibrium urea denaturation in D2O. The denaturation curves were analyzed by assuming two-state unfolding and the linear extrapolation method

(4)

where the m-value describes the dependence of free energy of unfolding on denaturant concentration and GU(D2O) is

an estimate of the conformational stability in D2O in the absence of urea (27, 41). The equilibrium conformational stabilities (GU) and parameters characterizing the urea denaturation curves at pD 7.4 and 25 °C are given in Table 2. GU was also determined at pD 7.7 for RNase T1 for comparison with hydrogen-exchange studies. All variants are destabilized compared to RNase T1. The A21G and G23A variants are destabilized by 1.1 and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively, and the A21G + G23A variant is destabilized by 2.2 kcal/mol. The differences in the conformational stabilities, GU, for the solvent-exposed and buried Ala f Gly mutations in the helix of RNase T1 are shown in Table 3. Alanine at exposed site 21 is stabilizing by 1.0 kcal/mol compared to glycine. In contrast, alanine at buried site 23 is destabilizing by 1.1 kcal/mol compared to glycine. The additivity of the GU of the single Ala f Gly mutations in the double variant suggests that the two sites behave independently (42). It is important to note that the variants are more stable in D2O than in H2O. The D2O solvent isotope effect causes a 1.4 kcal/mol increase in stability for RNase T1 as determined by urea denaturation (20). The m-values (Table 2) and the changes in stabilities between variants are the same within error in D2O and H2O. The average m-value in D2O is 1.28 ( 0.07 kcal/mol M. This is close to the value of 1.21 ( 0.07 kcal/mol M observed by Myers et al. (22) for the set of 20 RNase T1 variants at position 21 (A21X) measured in H2O. Hydrogen Exchange.

(see Supporting Information Table 1). The GHX values for the 42 measurable amide protons were determined using eq 2 and the krc values from model peptide data (2). The GHX values are given in Table 4. The hydrogen-exchange rates of RNase T1 and the variants obey EX2 behavior at pD 7.47.7, as discussed previously (11, 20). The GHX values for the most stable residues in all four variants are considerably larger than the corresponding GU values (compare stabilities in Tables 2 and 4). The GHX

values are not directly comparable to GU values measured by urea denaturation, unless a correction for cis T trans proline isomerization is included, as summarized above and discussed previously (10, 20). RNase T1 has two cis prolines (Tyr-Pro39 and Ser-Pro55) and two trans prolines (TrpPro60 and Ser-Pro73). Therefore, the total correction for the Xaa-Pro isomerization effect on RNase T1 and the variants is 2.53 kcal/mol [determined from Table 2 in Huyghues-Despointes et al. (20) using data from Reimer et al. (21)]. If we add this contribution to the GU values (denoted as G/ ), we find good agreement between G/ U U and GHX for the most stable residues. The GHX values that agree within error (( 0.5 kcal/mol) to G/ are U boldfaced in Table 4. The effect of the Ala f Gly mutations on stability for each measurable residue is shown in Figure 5. We determined

Hydrogen Exchange of RNase T1 and Ala f Gly Variants GHX using eq 3 for all residues except at the substitution site and for the residue (i + 1) from that site. For these residues, we calculated GHX using the different krc values and eq 2. The solvent-exposed (Figure 5A) and buried (Figure 5B) Ala f Gly substitutions affect the stability of residues throughout the sequence of the protein. We have categorized the residues according to their GHX values in Table 4. If a residue exchanges from the globally unfolded form in both variants (solid bar), GHX for that residue approaches the GU value (hatched line). The average GHX value for these global residues is 0.72 ( 0.10 kcal/ mol for the substitution at position 21 and -0.95 ( 0.02 kcal/mol for the substitution at position 23 (solid line). For residues where only one of the two variants has a global stability and the other is less stable (gray bars), the GHX values are also close to GU. The less stable residues (open bars) are affected by mutation to varying amounts. Some of these residues have GHX values that are greater than GU, while others are insensitive to the mutations in the helix. DISCUSSION Effect of Ala f Gly Substitutions on the Stability and the Structure of RNase T1. Alanine at position 21 is stabilizing by 1.0 kcal/mol compared to glycine as determined by the analysis of urea denaturation curves and 0.72 kcal/mol by hydrogen exchange. These values agree with those obtained previously in the G23A variants of RNase T1 (0.90 kcal/ mol) and the peptides of identical sequence (0.98 kcal/mol) (22, 23). The side chain at this position lies on the solventexposed surface of RNase T1 and has little contact with other residues. This is consistent with the observation that there are few changes in chemical shift for residues outside the helix. The stabilizing effect of alanine compared to glycine is caused primarily by the difference in helix propensities between the two amino acids (43). Alanine is a very good helix former, while glycine is entropically unfavorable because it lacks a -carbon and hence can occupy a larger region of (, ) space in the unfolded state (44). In contrast, alanine at position 23 is destabilizing by 1.1 kcal/mol compared to glycine by urea denaturation and by 1.0 kcal/mol by hydrogen exchange. This position in the helix is 100% buried according to the accessible surface area calculations of Lee and Richards (45) and packs tightly against the protein core. This is evident from the chemical shift and crystal structure differences between G23A and RNase T1 for residues in the helix and in the -strands surrounding this site. These results show that the stability is reduced in G23A mainly because the additional methyl group introduces steric strain at the mutation site. This strain must be considerably larger than the helix stabilization expected for replacing glycine by alanine. Most single site mutations in proteins do not significantly alter the NMR chemical shifts of residues throughout the structure; only residues near the mutation site are generally affected (see, for example, refs 13 and 46-48). Interestingly, this has been seen even when introducing a charged residue into the hydrophobic core of thioredoxin (49). In this case, there are only significant chemical shift differences between the mutant (L78K) and the wild-type proteins for residues that are within 12 Å of the altered site. In our study, the

Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 50, 1999 16487 A21G variants of RNase T1 display this typical behavior, while the G23A variants do not. We observe significant chemical shift changes for residues throughout the sequence when mutating a glycine to alanine at position 23 (Figures 2 and 3). Changes are even seen for residues in -sheet 5 that are 20 Å away from the mutation site. Therefore, we decided to determine the X-ray structure to see if there was a major alteration in structure and found only minor differences (Figure 4). This is not always the case. For example, an A98V mutation in T4 lysozyme, where a bulkier side chain is introduced between two helices in the hydrophobic core of the C-terminal domain, shows large chemical shift changes (50) and structural rearrangements throughout the domain (51) (i.e., the helices move apart by up to 0.7 Å). The change in stability of the A98V mutation in T4 lysozyme is also much larger (4.9 kcal/mol) than is seen here for the G23A mutation in RNase T1. We conclude that the NMR chemical shifts are very sensitive to the electronic environments of RNase T1 and the G23A variant, but only small perturbations in the structure and stability for this variant are observed. The results indicate that the G23A mutation transmits small changes throughout the entire structure. The results also show that since the chemical shift differences are greater for the mutations at site 23 than at site 21 and no major changes in structure for G23A mutation are seen, the structures of A21G and RNase T1 are likely identical. Global Residues Determined by GHX. We observe a 2-fold difference in stability between the smallest and largest measurable GHX values for each variant (Table 4). Other amides in RNase T1, not included in Table 4, exchange much faster and have smaller GHX values. Hydrogen-bonding interactions and burial in the native state slow the exchange of many amide groups. Listed in Table 4 are the hydrogen bond acceptors of the protected amide groups in RNase T1. Almost all NH groups of these residues are hydrogen bonded in secondary and tertiary structures. The accessible surface area calculations show that the amide nitrogens of most residues that are protected from exchange are over 90% buried [except Ser12 (74%), Leu62 (77%), and Val89 (42.3%)] (45). The native-state structure does not, however, reveal why some residues have higher hydrogen-exchange stabilities than other residues. Protection from exchange in RNase T1, as in other proteins, has no clear correlation with the distribution of hydrogen bond distances, the B-factors from the crystal structure, or the temperature dependence of the amide proton chemical shifts by NMR (52, 53). The variation in stabilities for the slowly exchanging residues is likely explained by the unfolding process described by eq 1. The protein must unfold to some exchange competent form (intermediate or unfolded) before exchange occurs. The exchange of protected NH groups can be dominated by local fluctuations that break only a few hydrogen bonds rather than by global unfolding. Monitoring hydrogen exchange with an external perturbant can help decipher the exchange patterns of several higher energy partially unfolded forms under native-state conditions. For example, the dependence of GHX on denaturant (the m-value) can provide some clues to these processes. A comparison of these types of experiments with pulse hydrogen-exchange studies suggest that the protection from exchange at equilibrium correlates with the order of protec-

16488 Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 50, 1999 tion of residues in the kinetic experiment (4, 16, 18). These results have led to the conclusion that protection from exchange may correlate with the folding pathway of a protein. Woodward and co-workers have suggested that the slowly exchanging hydrogens represent the protein folding core that determines the overall fold of the protein (18 and references therein). The relationship between hydrogen exchange and the folding core is seen for RNase T1. Several of the slowest exchanging residues in -sheets 2, 3, and 4 are protected first in the rapid-quench hydrogen-exchange experiment (11, 54). In the present study, we have focused mainly on globalexchanging residues since we did not monitor exchange as a function of an external perturbant. We identify globalexchanging residues under our experimental conditions by comparing GHX and G/ . The residues with the largest U GHX values for RNase T1 and the variants, boldfaced in Table 4, agree within error to the conformational stabilities measured by urea denaturation when the proline isomerization effect is taken into account. Most of the global-exchanging residues in RNase T1 also exchange globally in the variants. This is seen for six residues (Trp59 and Phe80 may be included but could not be measured in all four variants.). Deviations in this trend are seen in the helix (Ala/Gly21, Gly/Ala23, and Tyr24), His40, His92, and two residues in sheets 3 and 4 (Arg77 and Ala87). The nonglobal stabilities for variants in this subset are just outside the error of the global stability except for residue 21 (refer to Table 4). These results may reflect the effects of the mutation. The most noticeable example is position 21. If a glycine is at position 21, a substantial decrease in GHX is seen compared to alanine at that position, suggesting a switch in exchange process from global to nonglobal. The number of global-exchanging residues varies with the stability of RNase T1. Perturbants can strongly affect the stability of a protein, and the effect need not be the same for each residue. RNase T1 has fewer residues that exchange through the globally unfolded form at pD 5.6 and 25 °C, where the conformational stability is higher (13 kcal/mol) than at higher temperatures (11) or pH 7 where the stability is 3-6 kcal/mol lower. At the most stable conditions, only the -sheet residues ( -strands 2, 3, and 4) have GHX values that match G/ , while residues in the helix have smaller U GHX values. Under conditions where the protein is less stable, some residues in the helix (Gln20, Ala21, and Tyr24) now exchange globally, as seen here and by Mullins et al. (11) at temperatures greater than or equal to 40 °C. These results suggest that the helix in RNase T1 exchanges by nonglobal unfolding at very stable conditions and by a global process at lower conformational stabilities (10 kcal/mol). Hilser et al. (55) have shown a similar trend for a fragment of  repressor (residues [6-85]) using computer modeling. Global Residues Determined by GHX. The Ala f Gly substitutions at both positions 21 and 23 affect the stability of residues throughout the sequence by varying amounts as shown in Figure 5. Similar results have been seen for other single site mutations in thioredoxin (49), T4 lysozyme (50), and HPr (48). This is consistent with exchange of the most stable residues occurring from the globally unfolded ensemble. The residues that we define as global in Table 4 using the GHX criteria have GHX values close to GU.

Huyghues-Despointes et al.

FIGURE 6: GHX values for the helical residues where position 23 is glycine (RNase T1 and A21G) (panel A) or alanine (G23A and A21G + G23A) (panel B). Open bars represent variants with an alanine at position 21, and closed bars represent variants with a glycine at position 21.

These residues of RNase T1 are located throughout the structure (Figure 1) and, by definition, must feel the full effect of the mutation. We find, however, that some residues with nonglobal GHX values also have GHX values near GU. From our data alone, it is not possible to explain why these residues are strongly affected by mutation. Additional experiments monitoring the effect of an external perturbant on the hydrogen-exchange stabilities will be necessary to decipher the stability patterns of nonglobal residues. The results do show, however, that classifying global exchanging residues by examining only GHD upon mutation, as has been done for BPTI (13), may be deceiving. Mutational analysis on CI2 (15) and barnase (14) shows results similar to those in this study: the GHX values for the most stable amide protons are similar to the GU value, and the GHX values for these residues are also close to the GU value. Unlike our results, Neira et al. (15) observed for CI2 that the majority of nonglobal residues are essentially not affected by the mutation. Perrett et al. (14) observe, however, for two stabilizing variants of barnase that some nonglobal residues have GHX  GU (Table 6 in ref 14), as is seen here for RNase T1. We conclude that global residues should be determined by comparing GHX and GHX upon mutation with conformational stabilities from traditional unfolding measurements (GU and GU). GHX and Helix Stability. The distribution of GHX values in the helix of RNase T1 and the variants is shown in Figure 6. The two panels show the effects of the Ala f Gly mutation at position 21 when position 23 is either glycine

Hydrogen Exchange of RNase T1 and Ala f Gly Variants (panel A) or alanine (panel B). The trend is essentially the same for the wild-type and the G23A RNase T1 backgrounds; the difference being the variants with glycine at position 23 are more stable. The trend in GHX values in the helix resembles those expected for a helical peptide in water with end fraying (56): the GHX values appear largest in the center of the helix (residues 20-24) and diminish at either end. The C-terminal residues are more stable than the N-terminal residues. The backbone amide protons of the first three N-terminal residues in the helix (Ser13, Ser14, and Asp15) exchange faster than can be detected probably because they lack backbone hydrogen-bond acceptors. The GHX of the Ala f Gly substitution at position 21 is primarily caused by the difference in helix propensities between the two amino acids, as described above. If we look just at GHX values for the helical residues in Figure 5A, we observe that the largest stability change from the substitution is at the mutation site and Ala22. The destabilizing effect diminishes in the helix with distance from the substitution site. This result is independent of the identity of the residue at position 23 (Figure 6) and is similar to what is observed when substituting a helix-breaking residue like glycine in the center of an alanine-based peptide helix (57). We do not observe this trend when comparing the Ala f Gly variants at position 23 where the stability is not solely dependent upon helix propensity differences between alanine and glycine (Figure 5B). Regardless, the Ala f Gly substitutions at position 21 or 23 have not destabilized the helix to the extent that it is not part of the global-exchanging core of the protein under our experimental conditions. At least one residue in the helix, Gln20, exchanges with global stability in all four variants. Helix Propensity Difference between Ala and Gly at Site 21 in the Helix of RNase T1. The difference in helix propensities between alanine and glycine has been measured in various model systems, including R-helical peptides and proteins (for reviews, see 22, 23, and 43). Most studies find a 1 kcal/mol difference in helix propensities between alanine and glycine. The two exceptions are found in the alaninebased AK/AQ (58) and EAK peptides (59). The effect of an Ala f Gly substitution in these peptides is closer to 2 kcal/ mol. The alanine-based peptides contain multiple alanine residues, while other systems have more natural distributions of amino acids in their helical sequences. Recently, Luo and Baldwin (60) explain the discrepancy by showing that nonpolar side chains can shield the interaction between water and polar peptide groups in a side-chain-specific manner, thus, suggesting a context dependence of the helix propensity from neighboring residues in the sequence. For either peptide or protein systems, the methods used to determine the free energy changes are model dependent. In peptide systems, the ellipticity values for each peptide containing the alanine or glycine substitution are converted to free energies by using helix-coil transition theories (61) to model the non-two-state nature of the overall transition. In protein backgrounds, the stability of the variant proteins is generally determined using urea denaturation, analyzed by the two-state unfolding model and the linear extrapolation method (43). Conversely, we use here an independent, model-free method, hydrogen exchange by NMR, to measure the stability difference between alanine and glycine variants in RNase T1. We examine directly the difference in rate

Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 50, 1999 16489 constants to convert the data to GHX. On average, the most stable residues show a 0.7 kcal/mol difference in stability for the Ala f Gly substitution at solvent-exposed position 21 in the RNase T1 helix. This is similar to the value of 1.0 kcal/mol determined by the two different modeldependent methods used in the same background sequence (22, 23).
