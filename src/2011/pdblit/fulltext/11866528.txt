Abstract CD38, a bifunctional enzyme capable of both synthesis and hydrolysis of the second messenger cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR). Using the natural substrate of the enzyme, NAD+, the ratio of ADP-ribosyl cyclase/ NAD glycohydrolase of CD38 is about 1/100. Here we describe that human seminal fluid contain a soluble CD38 like enzyme with an apparent M.W. of 49 kDa. When purified this enzyme has a cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase ratio of about 1/120. However, the in situ cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase ratio measured in seminal plasma approaches 1/1. We also found that physiological concentrations of zinc present in the seminal fluid, in the range of 0.6 to 4 mM, are responsible for the modulation of the cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase ratio. This new information indicates that the cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase ratio can be modified in vivo. D 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Introduction Release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores is a widespread component in several signaling pathways (Chini and de Toledo, 2001; Dousa et al., 1996; Lee, 1997; Okamoto, 1999). Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) is a naturally occurring nucleotide implicated on the regulation of the

gating properties of the ryanodine channel. Recently, it has been proposed that cADPR is an intracellular second messenger (Chini and de Toledo, 2001; Coronado et al., 1994; Dousa et al., 1996; Galione, 1994; Lee, 1997; Okamoto, 1999). In mammalian tissues this nucleotide is metabolized by CD38, (a bifunctional enzyme capable of both synthesis and hydrolysis of cADPR (Chini and de Toledo, 2001; Dousa et al., 1996; Galione, 1994; Lee, 1997; Okamoto, 1999). Using the natural substrate of the enzyme, NAD+, the ratio of ADP-ribosyl cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase of CD38 is about 1/100 (Beers et al., 1995; de Toledo et al., 2000; Genazzani et al., 1996; Guida et al., 2002; Takasawa et al., 1993; Zocchi et al., 1993; Tohgo et al., 1994, 1997). This raises the questions of how is CD38 and cADPR metabolism regulated. Several compounds, including metal ions (such as Zn2 +) and nucleotides (such as ATP, and ADPR) have been shown to modulate the cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase ratio of CD38 in vitro (de Toledo et al., 2000; Genazzani et al., 1996; Kukimoto et al., 1996; Takasawa et al., 1993; Zocchi et al., 1993; Tohgo et al., 1994, 1997). However, whether regulation of the cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase ratio occurs in vivo is not known. Here we describe that human seminal fluid contain a soluble CD38 like enzyme. When purified this enzyme has a cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase ratio of about 1/120; similar to other purified mammalian ADP-ribosyl cyclases (Beers et al., 1995; de Toledo et al., 2000; Genazzani et al., 1996; Kukimoto et al., 1996; Takasawa et al., 1993; Zocchi et al., 1993; Tohgo et al., 1994, 1997). However, the in situ cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase ratio measured in seminal plasma approaches 1/1. We also found that physiological concentrations of zinc present in the seminal fluid are responsible for the modulation of the cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase ratio. This new information indicates that the cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase ratio can be modified in vivo.

Material and methods Human seminal plasma After Institutional Research Board approval human semen was obtained from health fertile donors age 25­35. Seminal plasma was obtained by incubating semen at 37 jC for 10 minutes, the liquefied semen was centrifuged at 1000 Â g for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 Â g for 1 h at 4 jC. The supernatant is further denoted as seminal plasma. In the present study, only freshly prepared seminal fluid were used. The in situ activity of the ADPribosyl cyclase was measured by addition of substrates namely: NAD or NHD to the liquefied human seminal plasma prepared as described above. ADP-ribosyl cyclase /NAD glycohydrolase ratio The Cyclase to glycohydrolase ratio was determined using NAD as the natural substrate of the enzyme. cADPR synthesis was assayed using NAD+ as in our previously studies (Beers et al., 1995). The enzyme preparations were incubated at 1 mg/ml in a medium containing 1 mM NAD, 0.25 M sucrose, and 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) at 37 jC. Aliquots prior and after the incubation were assayed for cADPR content using the sea urchin egg homogenate bioassay and HPLC as described before (Beers et al., 1995). Specific activity was expressed as nmoles of cADPR

produced mg protein/minute. NAD glycohydrolase activity was determined in the same sample by HPLC analysis. Fluorescent measurement of cyclase In selected experiments were only the cyclase activity as measured NHD was used as substrate (de Toledo et al., 2000). Enzyme preparation were incubated in a medium containing 0.2 mM NHD, 0.25 M sucrose, and 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) at 37 jC. Activity was determined using a fluorometric assay at 300 nm excitation and 410 nm emission. Detection of nucleotides Sea urchin egg homogenates bioassay cADPR was detected using the sea urchin egg bioassay and HPLC as described previously (Beers et al., 1995). Homogenates from Lytechinus pictus egg were prepared as described previously with minor modfication (Beers et al., 1995). Eggs were obtained by injection of 0.5 M KCl into the coelomic cavity, and shed in artificial seawater. The jelly coats were washed from the eggs by several passages through 80-mm mesh silk. The eggs were then washed once in artificial sea water, twice in Ca2+-free sea water containing 1 mM EGTA, twice in Ca2+-free water without EGTA and once in a homogenizing buffer containing 250 mM N-methyl glucamine, 250 mM potassium gluconate, 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.2), 1 mM MgCl2, 2 U/ml creatine kinase, 4 mM phosphocreatine, 1 mM ATP, 25 mg/ml leupeptin, 20 mg/ml aprotinin and 100 mg/ml soyben trypsin inhibitor. A 25% suspension was prepared by homogenization with 4 to 5 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with a type A pestle; the homogenate was then centrifuged for 10­12 sec at 13,000 g at 4 jC. The supernatant was collected and stored in 1 ml aliquots at À 70 jC. Frozen homogenates were thawed in a 17 jC water bath and diluted to 1.25% with an intracellular media (IM) solution containing 250 mM N-methyl glucamine, 250 mM potassium gluconate, 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.2), 1 mM MgCl2, 2 U/ml creatine kinase, 4 mM phosphocreatine, 1 mM ATP, 3 Ag/ml oligomycin, and 3 Ag/ml antimycin. After incubation at 17 jC for 3 hs, 3 AM fluo-3 was added. Fluo-3 fluorescence was monitored at 490 nm excitation and 535 nm emission in a 250 Al cuvette at 17 jC with a circulation water bath and continuously mixed with a magnetic stirring bar, using Hitachi spectrofluorometer (F-2000). The addition of stock solutions of various substances did not exceed 2% of the homogenate volume in the cuvette. Detection of cADPR was determined after incubation of tissue extracts with NAD (as described above). Aliquots of 3 to 7 Al of the assay media were tested for the Ca2+ release activity using the sea urchin egg homogenate bioassay (Beers et al., 1995). This method is very sensitive and specific for the detection of cADPR when homologous desensitization and specific inhibitors are use (Beers et al., 1995). HPLC analysis of nucleotides The synthesis of cADPR was further verified by HPLC analysis, performed by anionexchange chromatography using AG MP-1 (Biorad) column eluted with a nonlinear gradient of trifluroacetic acid as described previously (Beers et al., 1995). The nucleotides were detected by UV absorption at 254 nm. The authenticity of the cADPR produced was confirmed by coelution with standard compounds and by the sea urchin egg bioassay as described previously (Beers et al., 1995).

Synthesis of standard nucleotides cADPR was synthesized by Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase, using homogenized Aplysia ovotestes as described previously (Beers et al., 1995). The reaction was stopped by acetone precipitation as described above for synthesis of cADPR. After acetone precipitation, the nucleotides were purified by HPLC anion exchange chromatography using AG MP-1 (Bio-Rad) resin packed into a (1 Â 10 cm) column. The nucleotides were eluted with a non-linear gradient of 150 mM trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and water; and monitored by UV-absorption at 250 nm. Purified cADPR or NAADP were evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac concentrator. cADPR and NAADP used in all experiments were at least 97% pure as determined by HPLC. Western blot for CD38 Western blot was performed as described before (Chini et al., 2002). The samples (100 Ag) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the protein was electrobloted onto nitrocellulose membrane. After being blocked with 5% nonfat milk, the membrane were probed with a monoclonal anti-human antibody (Santa Cruz, Inc.). The immunoreactive bands were detected by using horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-mouse IgG as secondary antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). Bands were elevated quantitatively by scanning with the use of PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation of CD38 Chaps solubilized seminal plasma extracts were mixed with a goat polyclonal anti-mouseCD38 antibody (Santa Cruz, Inc.), a monoclonal anti-human CD38 (Santa Cruz, Inc.) or a non-specific IgG1 as described before. In PBS with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated at 4 jC for 3 hs. The reaction mixture, after being incubated for 3 hs, with a protein A-Cellulofine, was centrifuged at 3,000 Â g, and the resultant immunoprecipitates and lysate were subjected to the assay of synthesis of cADPR. Materials L. pictus and Aplysia californica were obtained from Marinus, Inc.; Long Beach, CA. Fluo-3 was purchased from Molecular Probes; IP3, oligomycin, and antimycin A were from Calbiochem. All other reagents, of the highest purity grade available, were supplied from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO). Zinc levels were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Sorensen et al., 1999). The reported experiments were repeated at least three to six times. The reported experiments were repeated at least three to six times when appropriate, data are expressed as means F SD. The unpaired t-test was used to evaluate statistical significance; P values < 0.05 were considered significant.

Result and discussion The ADP-ribosyl cyclase from seminal plasma We found that seminal plasma contains an ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity . The in situ activity of the seminal plasma cyclase was measured by addition of NAD to undiluted liquefied seminal plasma. The activity of the seminal plasma cyclase is seven times higher then the cellular ADP-

ribosyl cyclase from human spermatozoa (data not shown). Furthermore, the seminal plasma ADPribosyl cyclase was inhibited by DTT, nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, and stimulated by ATP with concentration dependences not different from the CD38 cyclase from HL-60 cells or the human spermatozoa cyclase (Table 1). Furthermore, the pH dependence and apparent affinity for NAD of the seminal plasma cyclase do not differ from that observed in CD38 cyclase from HL-60 cells (Table 1). To determine whether the seminal plasma ADP-ribosyl cyclase was a CD38-like enzyme we attempt to immunoprecipitate the cyclase activity with anti-CD38 specific antibodies. We found that the seminal plasma ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity was completely immunoprecipitated by a monoclonal anti-human CD38 antibody, and partially precipitated by an anti-mouse polyclonal CD38 antibody (Fig. 1A) We observed that after immunoprecipitation immunoreactive CD38 was observed only on the pellet and not on the supernatant (data not shown). Western blot analysis of the seminal plasma leads to the identification of an immunoreactive protein with an apparent MW of 49 kDa (Fig. 1B). This protein appears to be a soluble form of CD38. It has been previously shown that human fluids contain soluble forms of CD38 (Ferrua et al., 1998). These enzymes appear to be derived from dimerization and cleavage of native CD38 (Ferrua et al., 1998). However, the role of the extracellular soluble forms of CD38 is not known. It has been previously proposed that extracellular cADPR exerts a signaling role (Dousa et al., 1996; Galione, 1994; Guida et al., 2002; Lee, 1997; Okamoto, 1999; Zocchi et al., 1993). In addition, recently an extracellular transporter of cADPR has been pharmacologically characterized (Guida et al., 2002). It is possible that cADPR synthesized in seminal plasma may have effects on the function of spermatozoa. However, this needs further experimentation. Furthermore, the origin of this new soluble CD38-like cyclase is not known. It is possible that this enzyme is the product of secretion from the prostate gland since high expression of CD38 has been found is prostate tissue (Kramer et al., 1995). In fact, immunoreactive CD38 has been found in secretory vesicles from prostate epithelium (Kramer et al., 1995). Further studies are needed to determine the role of CD38 in seminal plasma and prostate tissue. Partial purification of the seminal plasma ADP-ribosyl cyclase We set up to partially purify the seminal plasma soluble cyclase. Using a size exclusion column we obtain a nearly 80­90% pure enzyme as confirmed by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). We further characterize the enzymatic activity of the purified cyclase. We found that the purified cyclase from seminal plasma had similar properties with the cyclase activity observed in native seminal fluid

Experiments were carried out as described under Material and Methods. The results are average and standard error of 3 independent experiments. The Km for NAD and the optimal pH were obtained using NAD as substrate. The Ki was obtained using NHD as a substrate.

including pH dependence, Km for NAD, Ki for nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, and DTT (Table 1). However, two major differences were noted. First the purified cyclase was stimulated by addition of Zn2 + ,in contrast the activity of the native enzyme in situ was not activated by this ion (Fig. 3). In fact, the metal chelator EDTA (Fig. 3) inhibited the activity of the native cyclase, determined in situ (in seminal plasma without any further additions). The cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase ratio Furthermore, the ratio of cyclase to glycohydrolase differs between the purified and native cyclase, in these experiments the cyclase and glycohydrolase ratio were determined using the natural substrate of the enzyme NAD. We found that the cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase ratio was 1/120 in the purified enzyme and 1/3 when the activity of the enzyme was determined in situ (Table 2). This indicates a 40 times increase in the relative cyclase activity of the enzyme when it is present in its native environment.

Fig. 2. Partial purification of the seminal plasma cyclase. Seminal plasma 15 mg/ml was fractionated in a size exclusion collum Superdex 75 10/30. The elution of the fractions was carried with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl and 150 mM NaCl at a rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions were collected every minute and the activity of the cyclase was determined in each fraction using NHD as a substrate as described before. The results is representative of three experiments. Electrophoresis and silver staining determined the purity of the cyclase. The purity of the cyclase was about 80 ­ 90%. These data was further confirmed by applying the sample to a bio-analyzer.

We further determined that the ratio of cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase could be increased in the purified enzyme by addition of Zn2+ (Fig. 3 inset, Table 2). In addition, the ratio of cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase of the native enzyme, measured in situ, was decreased by the addition of EDTA (Fig. 3 inset, Table 2). Zinc ion has been previously shown to stimulate the CD38 cyclase activity and at the same time inhibits the glycohydrolase activity changing the ratio of cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase (Kukimoto et al., 1996). The mechanism of action of Zn2+ appears to be related to a conformational change in CD38 that prevents the access of water to the enzyme-ADP-ribose-oxocarbonium ion, resulting in elevation of the production of cADPR (Kukimoto et al., 1996). These indicate that high concentrations of Zn2+ in seminal fluid could be responsible for the modulation of the cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase ratio in situ. In fact, high concentrations of Zn2+ have been described in human seminal fluid (Sorensen et al., 1997, 1999). We measured the Zn2+ concentration in seminal fluid. We found that seminal fluid contains mM concentrations of this ion, in the range of 0.6 to 4 mM with an average of 2.2 mM. In fact, addition of 2 mM Zn2+ to the purified seminal plasma cyclase or HL-60 CD38 cyclase lead to an increase in the cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase ratio of about 35­40 times (Fig. 3 inset, Table 2). The actual cyclase/ glycohydrolase activity was 38 nmoles of cADPR/4560 nmoles of ADPR in absence of Zn2+. In the presence of 2 mM Zn2+ the cyclase/glycohydrolase activities were 129 nmoles of cADPR/387nmoles of ADPR. In addition, we also observed that the cADPR glycohydrolase activity of the purified seminal plasma ADP-ribosyl cyclase was inhibited by 68 F 12% by 2 mM Zn2+. This indicates that Zn2+ may be a direct inhibitor of the cADPR hydrolysis in seminal plasma and may lead to accumulation of cADPR. When assayed in the same concentration observed in seminal fluid other ions such as: Ca2+, Mg2+ and Cu2+ did not change the cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase ratio of the purified seminal plasma cyclase or CD38 (data not shown). In conclusion Zn2+ can increase the activity of the ADP-ribosyl cyclase and inhibits the NAD glycohydrolase activity, these you probably lead to accumulation of

Fig. 3. Effect of Zn2+ on the activity of the ADPR-cyclase, using NAD as substrate. Activity of the seminal plasma cyclase was determined in situ and after purification of the enzyme as described in Fig. 2. In A the activity of the purified cyclase was assayed in a medium containing 0.25 M sucrose and 20 mM Tris-HCl and 0.2 mM NAD. In B the in situ activity was performed in undiluted seminal plasma with the addition of 0.2 mM NAD. The activity of the cyclase was determined in the presence of no further additions, 2 mM ZnCl2, or 5 mM EDTA.The difference between control and Zn2+ are significant for graphic A (P value < 0.05), but not in graphic B. 100% activity corresponds to 38 nmoles of cADPR/mg of protein/min in the purified cyclase (Graphic A), and 1.8 nmoles of cADPR/mg of protein/min in the crude seminal plasma cyclase (Graphic B). The inset of graphic A demonstrates the effect of Zn2+ on the cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase ratio of purified ADP-ribosyl cyclase, using NAD as substrate. The ratio of synthesis of cADPR (cyclase activity) and ADPR (NAD glycohydrolase activity) carried out by the purified seminal plasma ADP-ribosyl cyclase was performed in a buffer containing 0.25 M sucrose and 20 mM Tris-HCl. The activity of the enzyme was determined as described in Material and Methods using 0.2 mM NAD as the natural substrate of the enzyme. The actual cyclase/glycohydrolase activity was 38 nmoles of cADPR/4560 nmoles of ADPR in absence of Zn2+. In the presence of 2 mM Zn2+ the cyclase/glycohydrolase activities were 129 nmoles of cADPR/387nmoles of ADPR.
