ABSTRACT RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) constitute versatile macromolecular interaction platforms. They are found in many components of spliceosomes, in which they mediate RNA and protein interactions by diverse molecular strategies. The human U11/U12-65K protein of the minor spliceosome employs a C-terminal RRM to bind hairpin III of the U12 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). This interaction comprises one side of a molecular bridge between the U11 and U12 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) and is reminiscent of the binding of the N-terminal RRMs in the major spliceosomal U1A and U2B00 proteins to hairpins in their cognate snRNAs. Here we show by mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays that the b-sheet surface and a neighboring loop of 65K C-terminal RRM are involved in RNA binding, as previously seen in canonical RRMs like the N-terminal RRMs of the U1A and U2B00 proteins. However, unlike U1A and U2B00 , some 30 residues N-terminal of the 65K C-terminal RRM core are additionally required for stable U12 snRNA binding. The crystal structure of the expanded 65K C-terminal RRM revealed that the N-terminal tail adopts an a-helical conformation and wraps around the protein toward the face opposite the RNA-binding platform. Point mutations in this part of the protein had only minor effects on RNA affinity. Removal of the N-terminal extension significantly decreased the thermal stability of the 65K C-terminal RRM. These results demonstrate that the 65K C-terminal RRM is augmented by an N-terminal element that confers stability to the domain, and thereby facilitates stable RNA binding.

INTRODUCTION Spliceosomes are multisubunit RNA≠protein enzymes that catalyze pre-mRNA splicing, i.e., the removal of noncoding sequences (introns) from precursor messenger RNA (premRNA) and the concomitant ligation of coding regions (exons) (for review, see Burge et al. 1999). Unique among other large, composite enzymes, spliceosomes assemble only in the presence of a substrate. Spliceosome assembly entails the stepwise binding of uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (U snRNPs) and numerous non-snRNP splicing factors on a pre-mRNA. After initial buildup of a pre-catalytic particle, major compositional and

conformational rearrangements are required to bring about a catalytically activated spliceosome (for review, see Reed and Palandjian 1997; Burge et al. 1999; Brow 2002; Nilsen ® 2003; Will and Luhrmann 2006). Thus, spliceosome function critically relies both on persistent as well as on transient interactions among its building blocks. Two types of spliceosomes have been identified in higher eukaryotes (for review, see Burge et al. 1999; Will and ® Luhrmann 2005): the U2-dependent (major) spliceosome and the U12-dependent (minor) spliceosome. The major spliceosome excises U2-type introns, which represent the vast majority of pre-mRNA introns. The minor spliceosome removes U12-type introns, which make up less than 1% of all noncoding sequences in humans (Burge et al. 1998; Levine and Durbin 2001). The two types of spliceosomes utilize different, but functionally analogous, snRNPs. The major spliceosomal U1, U2, and U4/U6 snRNPs are replaced, respectively, by the U11, U12, and U4atac/U6atac snRNPs in the minor spliceosome. The U5 snRNP is common to both spliceosomes. 1305

The snRNPs are composed of a unique snRNA, a set of seven Sm or Sm-like (LSm) proteins, and a varying number of particle-specific proteins (for ® review, see Will and Luhrmann 1997). Analogous major and minor spliceosomal snRNPs differ either with respect to their RNA components only (U4/U6 versus U4atac/U6atac) or with respect to both their snRNAs and their specific proteins (U1 and U2 versus U11/U12). Unlike U1 and U2 in the major spliceosome, U11 and U12 form a stable di-snRNP, even in the absence of the pre-mRNA (Frilander and Steitz 1999; Will et al. 2004). While the Sm proteins and the multicomponent splicing factor SF3b are present both in the major U1 and U2 snRNPs and the minor U11/ U12 di-snRNP, seven proteins not 380≠517 , U1A-nRRM, and U2B99found in U1 or U2, denoted 65K, 59K, FIGURE 1.

Canonical RRMs bind single-stranded RNA regions by splaying them out across their b-sheet surface.

comprise an archetypal core RRM fold. The minimal motif is augmented by an a-helical insertion (residues 449≠454; helix a19) after the first a-helix (Fig. 3A, cyan). Residues C-terminal of the core RRM lack regular secondary structure and are disordered beyond residue 506. The ordered portion of the C-terminal tail runs along one edge of the b-sheet and covers a peripheral portion of the b-sheet surface (Fig. 3A, black). The amino acids comprising the N-terminal expansion form two short a-helices (Fig. 3A, helices aA, aB), one 310helix (Fig. 3A, 310A), and a long loop. These elements run along one side of the b-sheet and reach around to the opposite a-helical side of the core RRM like a clamp (Fig. 3A). The N-terminal expansion appears to be stably fastened to the core RRM by extensive hydrophobic interactions and additional hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3B). Overall, 1766 A2 of combined surface area are covered between the core RRM and the N-terminal expansion (residues 387≠ 417). Thus, the structure suggests that the additional elements are an integral part of the domain fold. A search for structural homologs using the DALI server (Holm and Sander 1993) did not reveal any other known RRM structure with a similar N-terminal appendix. 65K C-terminal RRM employs canonical motifs to bind RNA Since part of the N-terminal expansion of 65K380≠517 is neighboring the canonical RNA-binding b-sheet surface (Fig. 4A), it is conceivable that the N terminus is directly involved in RNA binding by the 65K-cRRM. Alternatively, it may play primarily a role in the structural integrity of the protein. To distinguish between these possibilities, we first asked whether the 65K-cRRM employs the canonical RRM structural elements for RNA binding. In U1A-nRRM, mutational and structural studies have revealed residues and regions that are critical for RNA binding (Nagai et al. 1990; Jessen et al. 1991; Oubridge et al. 1994). We therefore identified analogous residues in 65K-cRRM based on our structure-based sequence alignment (Fig. 1A), introduced the corresponding mutations, and tested RNA binding of the mutant proteins by EMSA. In U1A-nRRM, mutations of aromatic residues on the b-sheet in RNP1 and RNP2 exert a large effect on RNA binding (Nagai et al. 1990; Jessen et al. 1991). Tyr423 from RNP2 of 65K-cRRM corresponds to the essential Tyr13 of U1A (Figs. 1A, 4A). Even the conservative mutation Tyr13Phe abolished RNA binding of U1A-nRRM entirely (Oubridge et al. 1994). We therefore converted Tyr423 of 65K380≠517 to an alanine and a phenylalanine and tested RNA binding of the mutant proteins. In complete analogy to the U1A-nRRM, both mutations essentially abolished binding to the U12 stem≠loop III (Fig. 4B, cf. lanes 1≠7 and lanes 8≠14). These results confirm that the b-sheet surface of 65K-cRRM is involved in RNA binding.

between strands b2 and b3 protrudes through the RNA loop and aids in splaying out the single-stranded portion of the RNA. A number of positively charged residues in this loop contact the phosphodiester backbone or the bases of the RNA. In U1A, mutation of Lys50 in the b2≠b3 loop to a glutamine leads to a 10- to 50-fold reduction in RNA affinity (Nagai et al. 1990; Oubridge et al. 1994). Lys50 is conservatively replaced by Arg464 in 65KcRRM (Figs. 1A, 4A). We mutated Arg464 to a glutamine and observed a z30-fold reduction in the apparent Kd determined by EMSA (Fig. 4B, lanes 15≠21). Arg52 in the b2-b3 loop of U1A interacts with the RNA loop-closing base pair in a sequence-specific manner. Upon mutation to a glutamine, RNA affinity of U1A-nRRM is lost, while the more conservative replacement with a lysine retains partial RNA binding (Nagai et al. 1990; Oubridge et al. 1994). In 65K-cRRM, Arg52 is replaced by Lys466 (Figs. 1A, 4A). We tested the function of Lys466 in 65K-cRRM by introducing a glutamine at this position. Analogous to the situation in U1A, the Lys466Gln mutation entirely abrogated RNA binding, as monitored by gel shifts (Fig. 4B, lanes 22≠28). The b2-b3 loop in 65K-cRRM is shorter (six residues) than the corresponding loops in U1A or U2B99 (nine residues). However, it has been shown that the length of this loop varies according to the size of the loop of the RNA ligand (Katsamba et al. 2002). ConsisFIGURE 3. Structure of 65K380≠517.

elements in a different orientation as, for example, in U1A-nRRM, and additional regions of 65K-cRRM may contribute to RNA binding. Novel modes of RNA binding have recently been observed in a number of noncanonical RRMs (for a recent review, see Clery et al. 2008). Notably, the overall RNA-affinity of 65K-cRRM (which lies in the micromolar range) is significantly lower than the affinity of U1A-nRRM to its cognate RNA (which is in the nanomolar range) (Nagai et al. 1990; Hall and Stump 1992; Katsamba et al. 2002). Presently, we cannot pinpoint the exact source for this differential affinity. Most likely it arises from a number of changes on both the protein and the RNA. The N-terminal expansion influences RNA binding primarily by stabilizing the fold of the core RRM To test whether the N-terminus directly participates in RNA binding, potential RNA-contacting residues were mutated, and the mutants were tested in gel-shift assays. In the 65K380≠517 structure, part of the N-terminal expansion borders the canonical RNA-binding surface (Fig. 4A). In particular, Val409 and Arg411 from the N-terminal extension may approach an RNA ligand and foster direct contacts (Fig. 4A). We separately mutated Val409 to alanine and Arg411 to glutamine. Both mutations caused a small decrease in RNA affinity (apparent Kd's of the GST-fusion proteins were estimated at z50 and z30 mM, respectively). The moderate effects on RNA binding suggest that some residues in the N-terminal extension may directly contact the RNA ligand. However, the putative contact points do not appear to be essential. We next asked whether the N-terminal expansion is important for the overall stability of the domain. Using a fluorescence-based thermal melting assay (Semisotnov et al. 1991), we compared the stabilities of 65K-cRRM constructs including (65K380≠517 and 65K380≠506) or lacking (65K411≠505) the N-terminal 1310

Furthermore, the initial fluorescence of the 65K411≠505 sample was significantly higher than that of 65K380≠506 or 65K380≠517, suggesting that the integrity of its hydrophobic core was corrupted already at lower temperatures. These data show that the N-terminal tail strongly stabilizes the core RRM. We suggest that this stabilization is important for RNA binding by supporting the appropriate folding and orientation of RNA-binding elements. Outlook: Modifying protein function by domain expansions Disorder predictions (Linding et al. 2003; Dosztanyi et al. 2005; Prilusky et al. 2005) suggest that the N-terminal expansion of the 65K-cRRM is intrinsically unstructured. Natively unfolded proteins or intrinsically unstructured regions in proteins undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding to an interaction partner such as another protein or a nucleic acid ligand (Wright and Dyson 1999). The N-terminal expansion of the 65K-cRRM seems to

behave intramolecularly in an analogous fashion. Upon binding to the core domain, it adopts a regular secondary structure. Recently, the structures of predicted domains in some other spliceosomal proteins were investigated and similar expansions that confer stability on the core domains or safeguard the domains against aggregation have been found (Pena et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2007). Reminiscent of the present case, these sequence additions are stably grafted onto the protein cores and have apparently become integral elements of the protein folds. For example, the Pml1p protein of the pre-mRNA retention and splicing complex (RES) exhibits a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain in its C-terminal half, while the N-terminal portion is intrinsically unstructured on its own (Trowitzsch et al. 2008). However, in the crystal structure (Trowitzsch et al. 2009), a portion of this N terminus is fixed on one flank of the FHA domain, and deletion of this tail dramatically reduces the solubility of the protein. In another example, a Jab1/MPN domain in the C-terminal region of the large Prp8 protein was found to be augmented by a number of internal insertions and terminal appendices (Pena et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2007). These additional elements again exhibited stabilizing effects on the core domain. In addition, they endowed the core fold with novel protein≠protein interaction capabilities (Pena et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2007). It remains to be seen whether the N-terminal appendix of the 65K-cRRM also bestows novel functions on the protein. Similar to the Prp8 case, it may facilitate protein≠protein interactions, or it may be involved in fine tuning or regulation of RNA binding. Interestingly, the RNA affinity and the specificity of the nRRM of U2B99 are increased by formation of a complex with U2A9 (Scherly et al. 1990a,b). Structural analysis has shown that U2A9 binds to the side opposite the b-sheet surface of U2B99 and fosters some distal, auxiliary RNA contacts (Price et al. 1998). Thus, the role of U2A9 in supporting U2B99 in trans resembles the function of the N-terminal expansion of U11/U12-65K cRRM in cis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning and expression

A DNA fragment encoding human 65K380≠517 was PCR-amplified and cloned into pGEX-6p-1 (GE Healthcare) using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. Mutagenesis was performed according to the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). DNA primers were obtained from MWG FIGURE 4. Mutational analysis of 65K380≠517.

inoculate 6 L of auto-inducing medium (Studier 2005) containing antibiotics. The cultures were grown to an OD600 of 0.6 at 37∞C, cooled to 16∞C, and incubated until cessation of growth. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3), 2 mM DTT (PBS buffer) supplemented with 1 tablet/30 mL Complete protease inhibitor (Roche).

Protein purification
Cells were ruptured by sonification, debris was removed by centrifugation, and the soluble fusion protein was captured on glutathione≠Sepharose 4 FF beads (GE Healthcare) pre-swollen in PBS buffer. Beads were washed with PBS buffer and subsequently with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT (buffer A). The fusion protein was eluted with buffer A plus 100 mM reduced glutathione (Sigma-Aldrich). The GST-tag was removed by adding 1/40 (mg/mg) Prescission protease and incubating overnight at 4∞C. Soluble protein was applied on a heparin Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) and eluted using a salt gradient from 150 mM to 1 M NaCl in buffer A. Peak fractions were pooled and subjected to gel-filtration on a Superdex 75 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT (crystallization buffer). This strategy yielded >98% pure protein as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. The protein was concentrated to 28 mg/mL using a 5 kDa MWCO concentrator (VIVAscience). Protein concentrations were determined via a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).

of [32P]-end-labeled RNA oligonucleotide (59-CCCGCCUACUU UGCGGG-39), 1 mL of 10 mg/mL of E. coli tRNA, and 0.25 mL of RNasin (Promega) in a final volume of 10 mL for 45 min at 4∞C. After addition of 6 mL of loading dye (50% glycerol, 0.5 x TBE buffer), RNA≠protein complexes were separated on a native 6% (29:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) polyacrylamide gel at 8 W and 4∞C. For GST-tagged proteins, the same procedure was applied, but mixtures were incubated in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 200 mM KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100. Bands were visualized by autoradiography. Quantification of the bands was performed with ImageQuant (GE Healthcare). Apparent Kd-values were estimated from the protein concentrations required to elicit a 50% shift of the RNA.

Thermal denaturation experiments
A total of 18 mL of purified proteins at 30 mM concentration in 20 mM Na/KPO4 (pH 7.5), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaF, 2 mM DTT were mixed with 2 mL of 53 SYPRO Orange (SigmaAldrich). The changes in fluorescence of the samples as a function of temperature (4∞C≠95∞C in steps of 1∞C/min) were monitored in a real-time PCR machine. The fluorescence was recorded once per degree with 30-sec intervals between reads.

Crystallographic procedures
We aimed at crystallizing 65K-cRRM in complex with RNA. Therefore, the protein was supplemented with 1.5 mM MgCl2 (buffer B) and incubated for 1 h with an RNA oligonucleotide mimicking hairpin III of U12 snRNA (59-CCCGCCUACUUUGC GGG-39). Crystals were grown by the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique with a reservoir containing 20% (w/v) PEG3350 and 0.2 M LiCl. For diffraction data collection, crystals were transferred to mother liquor plus 15% (v/v) propylene glycol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at 100 K at the PXI beamline of SLS (Villigen) using a microfocused beam. Data were processed with the HKL2000 suite of programs (Otwinowski and Minor 1997). Crystals belonged to space-group C2 and exhibited a solvent content of 47%, assuming one 65K-cRRM molecule without RNA ligand per asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program Molrep (Vagin and Teplyakov 2000) using the structure coordinates of the U1A-nRRM (from PDB ID 1URN) (Oubridge et al. 1994). Iterative cycles of manual model building in Coot (Emsley and Cowtan 2004) and automatic refinement using the programs Phenix (Adams et al. 2002) and REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al. 1997) yielded the final model (Table 1). The structure factors and coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (http://www.pdb.org) under entry code 3EGN, and will be released upon publication.
