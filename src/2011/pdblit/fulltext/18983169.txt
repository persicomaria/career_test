The DsbD protein is essential for electron transfer from the cytoplasm to the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria. Its N-terminal domain dispatches electrons coming from cytoplasmic thioredoxin (Trx), Via its central transmembrane and C-terminal domains, to its periplasmic partners: DsbC, DsbE/ CcmG, and DsbG. Previous structural studies described the latter proteins as Trx-like folds possessing a characteristic C-X-X-C motif able to generate a disulfide bond upon oxidation. The Escherichia coli nDsbD displays an immunoglobulin-like fold in which two cysteine residues (Cys103 and Cys109) allow a disulfide bond exchange with its biological partners.We have determined the structure in solution and the backbone dynamics of the C103S mutant of the N-terminal domain of DsbD from Neisseria meningitidis. Our results highlight significant structural changes concerning the -sheets and the local topology of the active site compared with the oxidized form of the E. coli nDsbD. The structure reveals a "cap loop" covering the active site, similar to the oxidized E. coli nDsbD X-ray structure. However, regions featuring enhanced mobility were observed both near to and distant from the active site, revealing a capacity of structural adjustments in the active site and in putative interaction areas with nDsbD biological partners. Results are discussed in terms of functional consequences.
The DsbD1 protein is a transmembrane transporter of two electrons from the cytoplasm to the periplasm of Gramnegative bacteria such as Escherichia coli. DsbD is composed of three domains, all possessing two essential cysteine residues: the C- and the N-terminal domains (cDsbD and nDsbD) lie in the periplasm, whereas the third central transmembrane domain (tDsbD) is embedded in the inner membrane (1-6). The mechanism by which the electrons

ABSTRACT:

are transferred is composed of three steps involving each of the three domains: electrons are first transferred (i) from the cytoplasmic thioredoxin (Trx) to tDsbD, (ii) then from tDsbD to cDsbD, and (iii) finally from cDsbD to nDsbD (7-11). The nDsbD directs the electron flow either toward the cytochrome c biogenesis pathway, Via the protein DsbE/ CcmG, or toward the protein DsbC involved in the disulfide isomerization and in the chaperoning system (12-14). Moreover, it has been shown that E. coli nDsbD could also interact with the protein DsbG the function of which is unknown so far (15). All the electron transfers are mediated through disulfide bond protein exchanges between reduced and oxidized forms. A few years ago, the structure of the oxidized form of the E. coli nDsbD was determined by X-ray crystallography (4). It displays a particular hydrophobic active site in which active cysteines (Cys103 and Cys109) are covered by a "cap loop" region (residues Asp68-Gly72) that protects them from the environment and blocks the active site from accessibility. Therefore, a structural displacement of the cap from the active site has to occur prior to reduction of the disulfide of nDsbD by cDsbD (16). An X-ray structural study of the mixed disulfide complex between these two partners has permitted insight to the opening of the cap concomitant to a significant repositioning of Phe70. Further, the inspection of X-ray structures of other mixed disulfide complexes involving, on one hand, E. coli nDsbD and, on the other hand, downstream partners DsbE/CcmG or DsbC has also shown the opening of the cap and the changeover of Phe70

NMR Structure and Dynamics of nDsbDC103S (17). No 3D structure of the reduced form of the nDsbD has been described so far. Moreover, all of the structures of E. coli nDsbD (i.e, the oxidized form and the structures in covalent complexes with its biological partners) were determined by X-ray technique, which does not allow characterization of internal motions of a protein. Recently, it has been shown that E. coli nDsbD is able to reduce in Vitro the oxidized form of the N-terminal domain of PilB from Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which belongs to the DsbE structural family (18). Furthermore, in addition to these qualitative data, nDsbD from Neisseria meningitidis was recently isolated by our group and was shown to efficiently reduce the N-terminal domain of PilB from Neisseria meningitidis (k2 value of 6.3 × 105 M-1 · s-1, unpublished results). In the present work, we have resolved the 3D structure in solution and backbone dynamics of the reduced form of nDsbD from Neisseria meningitidis using NMR spectroscopy. In fact, it is the C103S nDsbD (nDsbDC103S), which has been studied with the subsequent objective to characterize the dynamic and structural factors involved in molecular recognition with biological partners. The structural and dynamic properties of nDsbDC103S are discussed, especially for the active site and regions putatively involved in interaction, in terms of functional consequences. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Preparation. The E. coli strain used for nDsbDC103S (19-146) production was C41(DE3) transformed with pETnDsbDC103S plasmid. The corresponding nDsbD fragment was obtained by PCR from dsbD ORF (sequences of oligonucleotides not shown), using N. meningitidis 8013 genomic DNA, kindly provided by Pr. Nassif (INSERM U570, Paris) between the NdeI and the SacI sites of the pET20b plasmid. 15N/13C- labeled sample was prepared by growing cells in a minimal media with 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source and with 13C-labeled glucose as the only carbon source. The nDsbDC103S production was induced at an OD600 of 0.6 by addition of 1 mM IPTG and harvested after 16 h for the 15N/13C protein by centrifugation, resuspended in minimal volume of buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) with 20 mM DTT, and sonicated. After fractionated precipitation at 40% and 70% ammonium sulfate saturation in buffer A, the contaminating proteins were removed by exclusion size chromatography on ACA54 gel (IBF) equilibrated with buffer A. Purified fractions were then pooled and successively applied to a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A, followed by a linear gradient from 0 to 0.4 M KCl (nDsbDC103S was eluted at 100 mM KCl) and a Phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A containing 1 M (NH4)2SO4, followed by a linear gradient from 1 to 0 M (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A (nDsbDC103S was eluted at 700 mM (NH4)2SO4) connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The sample purity and molecular mass were checked by SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry, respectively. The protein was isolated by gel filtration on Econo-Pac 10 DG Column (Bio-Rad laboratory) equilibrated with 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The NMR sample contained 0.5 mM 15N/ 13 C protein concentration (90% H2O, 10% D2O) in 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.0.

Biochemistry, Vol. 47, No. 48, 2008 12711 NMR Spectroscopy. All spectra were acquired at 298 K on a Bruker DRX 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. Spectra were processed using the program XWINNMR (Bruker) and analyzed with the program CARA (19). TSP-d4 (Euriso-top) was used as an internal reference for 1H chemical shift, whereas indirect referencing was used for 13C and 15N chemical shifts (20). Backbone amide 1HN, 15 N, 13CR, 1HR, and 13C and side-chain 1H and 13C resonances were assigned using 1H-15N HSQC, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNHA experiments. HNHB, HCCH-TOCSY, CC(CO)NH, and 1 H-15N,1H-13C HSQC-NOESY spectra at two different mixing times (70 and 100 ms) were also performed for sidechain assignments. The slow amide proton exchange in D2O solution (21) and temperature-dependence at five different temperatures (287, 291, 296, 298 and 305 K) (22) and the long-range HNCO experiment were used to determine the hydrogen-bond pattern of the protein (23). Structure Calculations. Interproton distance restraints were derived from two-dimensional 1H/15N NOESY experiment and three-dimensional 1H-13C/15N HSQC-NOESY experiments. First, ATNOS/CANDID program was used to obtain, after seven cycles, an initial set of restraints (24, 25). Second, the NOE cross-peak assignments and intensities were checked visually, and the restraint set was refined. Restraints for the pseudoatoms were systematically overestimated. The occurrence of a hydrogen bond was defined as a couple of distance restraints with an upper limit of 2.0 Å (up to 2.4 Å in few cases) between the acceptor heavy atom and the hydrogen atom and an upper limit of 3.0 Å (up to 3.3 Å in a few cases) between the acceptor and donor heavy atoms. Torsion restraints for the  and  angles were derived from the program TALOS (26), and all the peptide bonds were kept planar and trans. A total of 1500 randomized structures were calculated, and a simulated annealing process was performed using the program CYANA (27). The 20 structures with the lowest target function were selected and refined using DISCOVER (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). Figures were drawn with the program MOLMOL (28). 15 N Relaxation Experiments. The 15N longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), 15N transverse relaxation rate (R2), and steadystate {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE experiments were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer, using the usual pulse sequences (29). A total of 256 (15N) and 2048 (1H) complex points were collected for the R1 and R2 experiments, with eight transients per increment and a recycle delay of 5 s. Ten inversion recovery delays of 2, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 ms were used for R1 measurement, whereas eight delays of 8, 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 112, and 144 ms were used during the CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) period of the R2 experiments. {1H}-15N NOE spectra were recorded in an interleaved way with and without proton saturation during relaxation delay, using 256 × 2 (15N) and 2048 (1H) complex points and 56 transients per increment typically. The 1H saturation was achieved by the application of 120° 1H pulses separated by 5 ms for a period of 4 s. Spectral widths for all heteronuclear experiments were 2433 Hz (15N) and 8389 Hz (1H) with carrier frequencies at 117.6 and 4.70 ppm, respectively. Data were processed using XWINNMR (Bruk-

er). They were zero-filled in the 15N dimension and apodized with a shifted square sine-bell window in both dimensions. Backbone Dynamics Analysis. NMRVIEW software (30), version 6.6.2, was used to measure the peak heights of the 15 N-1H cross-peaks and to determine the R1 and R2 values from a fit to a single-exponential decay function and also the {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE from the ratio between the intensities of a peak in the spectra collected with and without proton saturation. All experiments were performed twice to provide an estimation of the uncertainty on R1, R2, and NOE values. R1, R2, and NOE relaxation parameters were analyzed by means of reduced spectral density mapping at Jeff(0), J(N), and J(H) values (31-34) using a chemical shift anisotropy of -160 ppm for the backbone amide group (35) and a NH bond length of 1.02 Å. Jeff(0) denotes that the exchange contribution to R2 is not explicitly considered (36). J(H) is the average of J(H), J(H + N), and J(H - N), which can be approximated by J(0.87H) (31). Tensor2 (37) was used for the Lipari-Szabo analysis (38, 39) of the backbone 15 N relaxation parameters. Only residues in secondary structure elements were used for determination of the overall tumbling. RESULTS Structure Calculations of nDsbDC103S. nDsbDC103S has been studied in a soluble state ranging from Met4 to Thr129, the numbering following that of the N-terminal domain of DsbD from E. coli. The chemical shift assignments have been previously reported (40). A nearly complete assignment of

the backbone and of the side chains has been realized except for Ala5, Leu6, Pro13, and Pro111. Superimposition of 1 H-15N HSQC spectra of the C103S mutant with the wildtype N. meningitidis nDsbD does not display major chemical shift variations of backbone amide groups, except for some residues in the vicinity of S103; this observation suggests that the mutant and wild-type proteins exhibit the same structural features (see Supporting Information, Figure S1). Moreover, no significant chemical shift perturbation is observed for CR and C atoms of all the residues, except of course, for the residue 103 (data not shown). The NMR solution structure of nDsbDC103S was calculated using NOE-derived restraints, backbone dihedral angle restraints derived from TALOS prediction (26), and hydrogen bond restraints obtained from the long-range HNCO experiment (23). The superimposition of the 20 representative structures for nDsbDC103S is shown in Figure 1a, and the structural statistics are summarized in Table 1. Only two restraint violations greater than 0.3 Å have been observed. According to PROCHECK-NMR analysis (41), 79.0% of the nonglycine and the nonproline residues remain in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, whereas 15.2% and 4.8% of the whole residues are, respectively, in the additionally allowed and generously allowed regions. Only 1% of the residues (Lys62) is located in disallowed regions. Moreover, the fine packing quality control analysis, performed with WHAT IF (42) using the most representative structure of nDsbDC103S, identifies this structure as a good one (WHAT IF Z-score for all contacts of -1.34). Considering the sequence from Asn9 up to Tyr125, the final 20

Biochemistry, Vol. 47, No. 48, 2008 12713 -sheet forms a partial -barrel. More precisely, the -sandwich is mainly formed by strands 1, 2, and 8 on one hand and strands 4, 9, and 12 on the other hand. It is flanked by strands 5 and 13, which are, respectively, hydrogen bonded to strands 8 and 1 (Figure 1b). These hydrogen bonds were highlighted by the NMR HNCO longrange experiment. The partial -barrel contains the active site (Figure 2a). Indeed, Ser103 (equivalent to E. coli Cys103) and Cys109 are, respectively, located on strands 10 and 11, and both side chains point toward the inner cavity of the partial -barrel. More precisely, side chains of Tyr40, Tyr42, and Phe70 point toward Ser103 and Cys109, the conformation of aromatic rings being well-defined in all 20 NMR structures. Besides, the cavity of the partial -barrel contains four aromatic side chains, thus endowing the active site with a particularly hydrophobic environment, enhanced by the side chain of Val76. Moreover, the aromatic rings of Tyr39 and Tyr110 lie on the external face of the partial -barrel and cover the backbone atoms of Ser103 and Cys109, the residues Ala104, Ala106, and Val108 enhancing the hydrophobicity of this external face. All of these features give the inner active site a particular hydrophobic character. The electrostatic potential of nDsbDC103S surface has been calculated and figured using MOLMOL (28). As far as the "back side" of nDsbDC103S (see Figure 1c for spatial orientation) is considered, it points out that potential charges are spread over the surface of strand 6 and surrounding residues. Indeed, the potential charges of Asp37 and Glu105 permit definition of a remarkable negatively charged side of the nDsbDC103S active site. The same phenomenon is observed on the "front side" along strand 12. In contrast, the surface of the region opposite to the active site is globally less charged. Reduced Spectral Density Mapping and Model-Free Analysis. The 15N longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), 15N transverse relaxation rate (R2), and steady-state {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE values of nDsbDC103S were measured for 107 backbone NH groups out of the 118 nonproline residues, (Figure 3a-c). The unanalyzed residues either were unassigned or overlapped. The average values for the backbone 15 N-nuclei are: R1 ) 1.51 ( 0.04 s-1; R2 ) 9.41 ( 0.31 -1 s ; NOE ) 0.74 ( 0.01 s-1. The relaxation parameters plotted versus the protein sequence globally display a nonlinear profile. For instance, a sharp drop of all three parameters is found within the N- and C-termini, around Val91, and here and there along the sequence. Reduced spectral density mapping, which does not require any model, was used first to analyze the relaxation data. The Jeff(0), J(N), and J(H) obtained values are represented in Figure 3d-f. A sharp decrease of Jeff(0) compensated for a large increase of J(H) observed within the N-terminus, the C-terminus, and the segment Lys89-Glu93 and for residue Gly121. This indicates the flexibility at both extremities of the protein, as well as in the 8- 9 loop and for Gly121. Residues Glu15, Gln43, Ala44, Gly63, and Val108 exhibit relatively high Jeff(0) values, while their J(N) and J(H) values are not lower than the average, which suggests the contribution of microsecond-millisecond time scale chemical exchange. J(N) values do not vary much along the sequence, indicating proximity to the isobestic frequency, where the contribution of J() is independent of the internal mobility (46).

calculated structures exhibit an atomic rmsd from the mean structure of 0.43 ( 0.09 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.10 ( 0.12 Å for all heavy atoms. In parallel to atomic rmsd, all  and  dihedral angles are well-defined with low standard deviations except the Met4-Leu11, Ala52-Asp53, Ser61-Glu64, and Ala88-Glu93 sequences for which significant standard deviation values are observed and are indicative of less-defined structural parts. Structure Analysis of nDsdDC103S. The core of the protein exhibits mainly three -sheets, all composed of antiparallel individual strands (Figure 1b). The first -sheet comprises five strands from Phe18 to Val24 for 1, Gly28 to Ile35 for 2, Ser59 to Phe60 for 5, Glu80 to Pro86 for 8, and Thr124 to Tyr125 for 13. The second -sheet comprises five strands from Tyr39 to Tyr42 for 3, Glu64 to Glu67 for 6, Arg73 to Tyr77 for 7, Gly102 to Ala104 for 10 and Val108 to Cys109 for 11. The third -sheet comprises three strands from Val47 to Asn50 for 4, Tyr94 to Tyr100 for 9, and Val113 to Ile119 for 12. All these -strands are clearly well-defined as proven by a weak backbone rmsd value of 0.27 ( 0.07 Å on -stranded secondary structures. According to NOE restraint data, one R-helix turn seems possible from Pro14 to Ala17. Globally, only the N-terminal region, from Met4 to Ala8, is largely disordered in all 20 NMR structures due to the partial chemical shift assignment and the lack of NOE restraints. As investigated on DALI (43) and VAST (44) servers, the fold adopted by nDsbDC103S is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Two main features characterize the structure adopted by this protein in solution: the first and the third -sheets are arranged in a -sandwich, while the second

Reduced spectral density functions of nDsbDC103S, J(H) (d), J(N) (e), and Jeff(0) (f), are also shown. Experiments were recorded on a Bruker DRX 600 MHz at pH 7.00, 25 °C. The secondary structure elements extracted from the mean structure are shown at the top.

To get a detailed picture of the global and internal dynamics of nDsbDC103S, the relaxation parameters were analyzed with a Lipari-Szabo approach (38, 39) by means of the Tensor2 software (37) and using the mean NMR structure. The R2/R1 ratios of the residues involved in secondary structures were used to determine the rotational diffusion tensor describing the overall tumbling of the protein. The principal components obtained are Dx ) 1.95 × 107, Dy ) 2.14 × 107, and Dz ) 2.57 × 107 s-1, which

gives a global correlation time of 7.38 ns, in agreement with a monomeric state. Besides, the direction of the principal axes, as well as the axial anisotropy (2Dz/(Dx + Dy) ) 1.26) and the rhombicity (Dx/Dy ) 0.91), are in agreement with the inertia tensor of the nDsbDC103S structure (see Figure 4). The results for the internal mobility are represented in Figure 5. The mean and median order parameters S2 are respectively 0.81 and 0.86. As generally observed in proteins, the N- and C-terminal extremities of nDsbDC103S show fast

motions of large amplitude, as depicted by weak S2, associated here to internal correlation times i < 0.1 ns or i > 0.1 ns, and by high J(H) values. This can be related to the high backbone rmsd values observed in these segments (Figure 5a). Likewise, the region Ala90-Glu93, which lies at the opposite side of the active site and which is also lessdefined in the NMR structure, displays similar striking dynamic features. Mobility is observed in the surrounding loops Ala25-Asp27 and Phe120-Gly123 too, as reflected by a weak S2, the presence of i or that of chemical exchange. Chemical exchange is indeed highlighted by high Rex term and Jeff(0) values for residues Phe120 and Asn122, as well as for Glu15, Gln43, Ala44, Asp53, Gln57, Gly63, Tyr94, and Val108. It can be noticed that some particular residues, located in secondary structures, display interesting dynamics parameters notably in the region of strands 6 and 7, even if their backbone rmsd is low. More precisely, Gly63, Glu65, Lys66, Glu67, Asp68, and Arg73, as well as the bend Gln43-Ile46, show particular profiles of reduced spectral density mapping and possess particular S2, i, or Rex terms (deviating at least from one standard deviation around the median value calculated on residues belonging to the core of the protein). DISCUSSION nDsbDC103S Global Topology. N. meningitidis nDsbDC103S displays an immunoglobulin-like fold comprising first a -sandwich and second an active site shaped as a partial -barrel. DALI and VAST investigations list E. coli nDsbD as the best structural homologue to nDsbDC103S. The amino acid sequence alignment shows that they share 26% sequence identity and that several residues surrounding the active site are conserved (Figure 6a). As expected, strong structural similarity is then observed with the oxidized E. coli nDsbD

All these parameters are plotted versus the amino-acid sequence and are also shown on the mean structure with the following rules: for panel a, the width of the spline is proportional to rmsd value and blue color is used to indicate secondary structure elements; for panels b-e, the width of the spline and the color intensity are proportional to the values on the graphical representation; for high values, the proportionality factor with the width of the spline has been decreased to avoid plot overloading. Some particular residues have been reported on the structure to facilitate the reading of the schemes. The secondary structure elements extracted from the mean structure are shown at the top.

Secondary structure numbering of E. coli nDsbD was reported according to Goulding et al. (4). Comparison between nDsbDC103S NMR solution structure (b) and E. coli nDsbD X-ray structure (c). The PDB access number 1L6P was used for E. coli nDsbD structure. Divergent secondary structure elements are, respectively, colored in blue and red on nDsbDC103S and E. coli nDsbD structures. Absence of clear secondary structures on one or the other, structure is highlighted with clearer colors. The figures were prepared with MOLMOL using default setting for secondary structures display (28).

X-ray structure (PDB access code 1l6p and 1jpe) (4), the unique structure available for an unliganded state of this N-terminal domain. However, several differences, notably in the secondary structures, can be highlighted. First of all, obvious indications of conformational changes are highlighted by the high difference of the  and  dihedral angle values comparing the well-defined parts of the N. meningitidis nDsbDC103S NMR structure with those of the E. coli nDsbD X-ray structure (Figure 7). Significant changes are observed essentially for the segments between the different strands and, also to a lesser degree, for some residues inside the 1, 8, 9, and 10 strands in nDsbDC103S. This leads to slight untwisting of the -sandwich in nDsbDC103S. A few minor differences can be underlined such as the length of the strands 1, 6, and 7, one residue shorter than their equivalents in E. coli nDsbD. Besides, the segment Gln43-Ile46 does not form a 310-helix but only a bend,

which is consistent with the presence of exchange terms Rex and fast i in this segment, since no secondary structure is observed. More importantly, several striking changes appear clearly in the composition of the -sheets (Figure 6b,c). First, the first -sheet of nDsbD is made up of three -strands ( 1, 2, and 8) in E. coli, whereas it contains two short additional strands ( 5 and 13) highlighted by long-range HNCO and 3D NOESY-HSQC experiments in N. meningitidis. The presence of these two strands is supported by the observation of high order parameters, similar to those found in the other rigid -sandwich secondary structures of nDsbDC103S. This major difference with E. coli nDsbD is due to the presence of hydrogen bonds in nDsbDC103S between Ser59-NH and Ala84-CO and Ser61-NH and Gln82-CO creating strand 5 and hydrogen bonds between Val24-NH and Gly123-CO and Leu22-NH and Tyr125-CO creating strand 13. Second, despite compatible backbone torsion

NMR Structure and Dynamics of nDsbDC103S

Biochemistry, Vol. 47, No. 48, 2008 12717 major consequence is to enlarge the internal diameter of the cavity. In nDsbDC103S, the aromatic ring of Phe71 interacts in a parallel manner with that of Tyr42, interacting itself with Tyr40 and Ser103. To avoid steric congestions, this network of interactions forces the cleft of the partial -barrel to be larger. In E. coli nDsbD, the aromatic ring of Tyr42 interacts with Tyr40 and Cys103 but orthogonally to that of Tyr71. The steric constraints are consequently weaker inside the cavity. That is the reason that the aromatic ring of Phe70 can move closer to Cys109, thus involving a tightening of the partial -barrel, as depicted by the decrease of distance from 7.0 to 5.9 Å between the C atoms of Phe70 and Cys109 compared with their equivalent residues in nDsbDC103S (see Figure 2). Role of Asp68. It had been proposed that the Tyr42 residue from E. coli nDsbD could mediate, instead of a water molecule, the proton transfer between Asp68 and Cys103 residues, thanks to close distances between the hydroxyl, carboxyl, and thiol groups of the latter residues (4). In the bunch of nDsbDC103S NMR structures, the mean distance between the O from Tyr42 residue and the O from Ser103 residue is equal to 4.16 ( 0.21 Å. This is comparable to the distance of 3.51 Å found for the equivalent residues in E. coli oxidized nDsbD and compatible with the hypothesis raised by Goulding et al. (4), However a mean distance of 6.48 ( 0.66 Å is observed between the O from Tyr42 residue and the carboxyl group of Asp68 residue in nDsbDC103S, whereas the corresponding atoms in E. coli nDsbD are separated by only 2.69 Å. Moreover it seems that these two residues do not display the sufficient dynamic properties to come closer. In regards to all these structural features, it is likely that the proton transfer between Asp68 and Cys103 residues in the native nDsbD from Neisseria genus may be orchestrated by an additional element, even if the Tyr42 residue is involved. Dynamics in the ActiVe Site. Dynamic properties of the active site have been analyzed more particularly in order to get insight into the enzymatic mechanism. Flexibility of the partial -barrel should be considered as a prerequisite in the enzymatic scheme so as to cross the barrier of steric congestions inside the cavity. It has been suggested that the better reactivity of Cys109 compared with Cys103 in E. coli nDsbD was due to steric congestion around Cys103 (4). About this hypothesis, a large but isolated exchange term, Rex, has been found for the Val108 residue neighboring Cys109 in nDsbDC103S. However, its particular dynamic features could denote that this term may mainly reflect motions of aromatic side chains in the neighborhood of the Val108 NH group (45), rather than backbone conformational changes that could facilitate access to solvent. Indeed, as other residues exhibiting a significant Rex term, the HN group of Val108 is close to aromatic rings, notably to that of Phe70 (and may therefore be sensitive to the variations of the ringcurrent effects induced by their motions). Nonetheless, it is reasonable to assume that conformational exchange can have a contribution, even minor, to all these exchange terms thus conferring some mobility to the backbone of nDsbDC103S, as depicted for example by the slight decrease of S2 term for Val108. Since structural changes have to make the catalytic cysteine accessible to substrate and since most of the residues surrounding sequentially Cys109 do not display sufficient

angles, the segment Asp57-Gly63 in E. coli nDsbD X-ray structure does not display hydrogen bonds permitting the formation of a -strand. In nDsbDC103S, a strand is found in this region. Third, as described by the authors, the C-terminal end of E. coli nDsbD is able to adopt, in the X-ray structure, a -sheet conformation involving the E. coli 5, 9, and 13 strands, which places this C-terminal segment on the opposite side of the N-terminus. Here, the four-residue longer C-terminal tail of nDsbDC103S is completely reoriented compared with that of E. coli nDsbD: it forms a strand 13 antiparallel to strand 1 and thus comes closer to the N-terminal extremity. The mobility found in the preceding loop Phe120-Gly123 may permit this strand 13 to move along strand 1 and to participate to the -sheet. These observations, done between nDsbDC103S and E. coli nDsbD, highlight the powerful role of NMR in revealing clear structural differences across bacterial species or oxidation states. The ActiVe Site: A Hydrophobic CaVity CoVered by a Cap Loop. As it has been observed for the oxidized E. coli nDsbD structure, the nDsbDC103S active site contains a highly hydrophobic cavity with several aromatic residues. Likewise, the two strands 6 and 7 cover Ser103 and Cys109. The cleft of the partial -barrel is thus cluttered with long side chains and access for substrates to active residues is consequently restricted. Interestingly, the so-called "cap loop" situated between strands 6 and 7 and more particularly the Phe70 side chain close the entrance to this cavity, like in the oxidized E. coli nDsbD. Therefore, the cap loop adopts a "closed position" and should possess a protective role in the reduced state too. Nevertheless, even if most of the residues forming the structure of the partial -barrel in E. coli nDsbD are conserved in nDsbDC103S, notably those whose side chains point toward the internal cavity, significant changes occur because of a single amino acid substitution at position 71 in the active site. Indeed, the aromatic ring of Phe71 from nDsbDC103S is largely reoriented compared with its equivalent Tyr71 in E. coli nDsbD, which is less hydrophobic and points toward the solvent (Figure 2a,b). The

Quinternet et al. concerning the oxidized form, the active site of the oxidized nDsbD should display similar dynamics features. The cap displacement would necessarily be triggered by the interaction with a specific biological partner. The induced conformational change would be such that the pKa of Cys109, which is above 8.5 in the unbound state (unpublished results), is lowered. This would consequently allow a nucleophilic attack. It is therefore important to identify the recognition elements involved in nDsbD interactions to elucidate its mechanism. Other putative interaction regions in nDsbDC103S are then discussed hereafter. Other PutatiVe Interaction Sites with Biological Partners. An interesting region around strand 12 displays a large negatively charged surface, as highlighted by the electrostatic potential analysis of nDsbDC103S (Figure 1c). This side of the protein corresponds to the interaction area of E. coli nDsbD with the subunit of the dimeric DsbC that is not reduced by nDsbD, as revealed by the X-ray structure of the complex (5). The potential charge repartition along the structure is quite similar between E. coli nDsbD and nDsbDC103S (see Supporting Information, Figure S2), but these negatively charged patches in nDsbDC103S could enable many more electrostatic interactions and thus should be also involved in the recognition with DsbC (or an equivalent in the Neisseria genus) or other protein partners. The slight decrease of the S2 term observed along the 12 strand could strengthen the assumption that this region may need to drive such interactions. Another remarkable part of nDsbDC103S lies at the opposite side of the active site. It is assumed in E. coli nDsbD to be interacting with the transmembrane domain tDsbD. It is to be noticed that this local region is not as well-defined as the rest of the protein and does not show -strands equivalent to E. coli 5 and 9 strands. Despite characteristic HRi/HNi+1 NOE correlations, no hydrogen bonds and no long-distance HN/HN or HR/HR NOE correlations have been detected between the segments Pro51-Leu55 and Ala88-Pro93bis for nDsbDC103S. In addition, outstandingly low S2 values associated to i or Rex terms are observed for Asp53 and especially for the Ala90-Glu93 segment. This clearly proves that the high rmsd observed in these regions (see Figure 5a) are due to an actual flexibility and not to a lack of NMR restraints. It also confirms that these two segments do not display a -strand organization in the nDsbDC103S structure. This could be explained by the higher global hydrophobicity of these two segments compared with their equivalents in E. coli nDsbD (Glu51-Ile55 and Asn88-Gly93 segments) as suggested by the electrostatic potential of both proteins (see Supporting Information, Figure S2). Indeed, in nDsbDC103S, they contain seven nonglycine hydrophobic residues compared with four residues in E. coli nDsbD. Moreover, there is no such strict alternation of hydrophobic and nonhydrophobic residues in the nDsbDC103 segments 52ADLL55 and 89KAVG92 as in their equivalent segments 52HAKI55 and 89QASA92 in E. coli nDsbD. Because hydrophobic residues tend to be buried in the structure, the alternation found in E. coli is indeed more favorable in stabilizing a -sheet structure, with Ala53, Ile55, and Ala92 side chains on one hand and His52, Lys54, Gln89, and Ser91 side chains on the other hand pointing, respectively, inside the -sandwich and toward the solvent. This allows, in E. coli nDsbD, sidechain interactions as seen between Lys54 and Gln89 or Ala53

mobility to expose it, it is likely that the cap loop region of nDsbDC103S displays a particular dynamics profile. Actually, our dynamics study highlights significant motions, notably for Gly63, Glu65, Lys66, Glu67, Asp68, and Arg73, indicating the ability for the backbone to be flexible in the segment around Phe70 residue of nDsbDC103S and therefore to adapt its conformation to the disulfide oxido-reduction partner. Consistently, the absence of motions for Phe70 in N. meningitidis nDsbDC103S is in agreement with its protection role against nonspecific interactions with cysteine residues. The motions observed at the beginning of strand 6 suggest that the Gly63-Glu65 segment could act as a hinge permitting the opening of the partial -barrel and recognition of the substrates. Likewise, mobility of the Gln43-Ile46 bend could reinforce this idea by introducing potential backbone adaptability near strands 6 and 7. This could explain the rearrangement observed upon complex formation in the E. coli nDsbD equivalent His66-Ser74 segment including Phe70 (47). Indeed, (while the position of the segment including Cys109 is hardly altered) the Asp68-Gly72 "cap loop" region acting as a closed gate is opened up as shown in the X-ray structure of the complexes with the upstream cDsbD (16) or the downstream DsbC (5) and CcmG (17). Finally, we have shown that the cap loop adopts a "closed gate position" in the structure of nDsbDC103S presenting a reduced form similar to that in the oxidized E. coli nDsbD. This involves that the recognition of the nDsbD reduced or oxidized forms by its partners would not rely on the cap loop conformation itself but rather on specific dynamic properties or on other structural elements. Moreover, it shows that the active cysteines are covered by this loop in both redox states, which confers to this loop a protective role, a requirement to avoid the nDsbD interacting nonspecifically. This implies that an opening of the cap must occur upon formation of a complex between nDsbD and its protein partner, in which the catalytic cysteine and the recycling one would become accessible to a reagent. The "opening of the gate" necessitates a conformational change, which could be allowed thanks to the significant motions identified in the Gly63-Arg73 segment and for the Gln43-Ile46 bend, which should consequently be observed in the oxidized form too. Indeed, in E. coli oxidized nDsbD, the S- interaction between S atom of Cys109 and the aromatic ring of Phe70 is described as stabilizing the disulfide bond (4). This observation suggests that this interaction indirectly maintains the closed position of the cap loop. Considering the bunch of the 20 reduced nDsbDC103S structures, such S- interaction does not exist because of an incompatible angle between the aromatic ring of Phe70 and Cys109. Yet, the cap loop is maintained closed. Therefore, the opening of the cap loop during the formation of complexes involving the reduced form of nDsbD and downstream oxidized partners CcmG (17) and DsbC (5) could not be driven by the rupture of this particular interaction but by the dynamics of the 6- 7 region. We can thus assume that the opening of the cap occurring with the formation of the complex between the oxidized form of nDsbD and the upstream reduced partner cDsbD (16) is also driven by dynamic properties. Even if the rupture of the S- interaction is required, we can legitimately think that, in the absence of relaxation data

NMR Structure and Dynamics of nDsbDC103S and Ala90 and permits backbone interactions between Glu51-Ile55 and Asn88-Gly93 segments. In the case of nDsbDC103S, Leu54 and Val91, respectively, equivalent to Lys54 and Ser91 in E. coli nDsbD, tend to bury their bulky side chains into the structure, to promote hydrophobic interactions, and to increase the distance between the backbone chains of the two considered segments, disabling specific -sheet backbone interactions. Loops Ala25-Asp27, Ala88-Pro93bis, and Phe120-Gly123 display remarkable motions at various time scales (see Figure 6). No published NMR and X-ray structures of a complex between nDsbD and tDsbD are available so far. We propose that the motions observed in this area, especially the striking flexibility of the segment Ala88-Pro93bis, could provide adaptability to the peptidic chain to interact with tDsbD. These dynamic features may be crucial to ensure a proper contact area between the nDsbD and tDsbD domains in Neisseria. This hypothesis is reinforced by the noteworthy hydrophobicity and the weak electrostatic potential (see Figure 1c) of this region, which could facilitate interaction with the transmembrane domain. To conclude, we have elucidated a solution structure of nDsbD in a reduced form and characterized its dynamics, which provides new important biological insights for the putative mechanism, so far based on crystallographic data gathered from the oxidized form or complexes. We have shown that the active site is protected by the "cap loop" between strands 6 and 7 both in the reduced and oxidized states. Therefore, the recognition of the two redox forms of nDsbD is not due to a conformational change of this cap loop. Moreover, a cap displacement must be triggered by the interaction with its specific partners, which can be permitted by the mobility highlighted in the Gly63-Arg73 segment and for the Gln43-Ile46 bend, forming a hinge. The results suggest a pronounced capacity of structural adjustments of the partial -barrel upon interaction with a biological partner, whatever the reduced or oxidized forms. This could explain why nDsbD can recognize several different disulfide oxido-reductase partners. Moreover, putative recognition structural or dynamics elements in nDsbD have been proposed, not only around the active site but also in more distant regions assumed to be involved in its interaction with DsbC and tDsbD.
