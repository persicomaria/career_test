ABSTRACT ThiI catalyzes the thio-introduction reaction to tRNA, and a truncated tRNA consisting of 39 nucleotides, TPHE39A, is the minimal RNA substrate for modification by ThiI from Escherichia coli. To examine the molecular basis of the tRNA recognition by ThiI, we have solved the crystal structure of TPHE39A, which showed that base pairs in the T-stem were almost completely disrupted, although those in the acceptor-stem were preserved. Gel shift assays and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments showed that ThiI can efficiently bind with not only tRNAPhe but also TPHE39A. Binding assays using truncated ThiI, i.e., N- and C-terminal domains of ThiI, showed that the N-domain can bind with both tRNAPhe and TPHE39A, whereas the C-domain cannot. These results indicated that the N-domain of ThiI recognizes the acceptor-stem region. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that the C-domain also affects RNA binding by its enthalpically favorable, but entropically unfavorable, contribution. In addition, circular dichroism spectra showed that the C-domain induced a conformation change in tRNAPhe. Based on these results, a possible RNA binding mechanism of ThiI in which the N-terminal domain recognizes the acceptor-stem region and the C-terminal region causes a conformational change of RNA is proposed.

INTRODUCTION Post-transcriptional modification produces a diverse array of RNA molecules, and plays various cellular roles from stabilization of the structured RNA, fidelity control of translation, to metabolic response to the environment (Persson 1993; Curran 1998). More than 100 chemically modified nucleosides have been reported to date, and the largest numbers are found in tRNAs (Rozenski et al. 1999). In bacterial and archaeal tRNA, 4-thiouridyl modification (s4U) is found at position 8, which characteristically acts as a photosensor for near-UV (Favre et al. 1969; Favre et al. 1971; Bergstrom and Leonard 1972). By irradiation with near-UV light, s4U is photocross-linked with a cytidine at position 13 in the tRNA D-stem (Favre et al. 1971). This results in growth delay and a stringent response to amino

acid starvation, as cross-linked tRNAs are poor substrates for aminoacylation (Thomas and Favre 1975; Kramer et al. 1988). s4U modification is introduced at position 8 by the cooperative activity of two enzymes, ThiI and IscS, transferring a sulfur atom from cysteine to tRNA (Supplemental Fig. S1; Kambampati and Lauhon 2000). First, IscS removes a sulfur atom from cysteine, which results in the formation of alanine and IscS-bound persulfide (IscS-SSH). This persulfide sulfur of IscS is then transferred to a cysteine residue on ThiI, resulting in ThiI persulfide (ThiI-SSH). Finally, in the presence of ATP, the persulfide sulfur from ThiI-SSH is transferred to tRNA. ThiI from g-proteobacteria and archaea consists of four domains, i.e., an N-terminal ferredoxin-like domain (NFLD), thio uridine synthases RNA methyltransferases and pseudouridine synthases (THUMP), modified P-loop motif involved in pyrophosphate binding (PP-loop domain), and rhodanese-like domain (RLD) (Webb et al. 1997; Palenchar et al. 2000; Waterman et al. 2006). As the THUMP domain is common to several RNA binding proteins, it likely acts as an RNA recognition motif (Aravind and Koonin 2001;

RNA binding mechanism of ThiI

Gabant et al. 2006). The crystal structures of ThiI from Pyrococcus horikoshii and Bacillus anthracis, which did not contain RLD, revealed an elongated structure in which the THUMP domain and the PP-loop domain were separated, with NFLD located between them (Waterman et al. 2006). As AMP was found in the PP-loop domain of B. anthracis ThiI, the PP-loop domain was thought to be an active domain. The sulfur atom is transferred from ThiI to tRNA via a cysteine residue. Escherichia coli ThiI contains five cysteine residues, Cys108, Cys202, Cys207, C344, and Cys456. Among these, previous mutational analysis showed that Cys344 and Cys456 are important for the activity (Palenchar et al. 2000; Mueller et al. 2001). Lauhon et al. (2004) examined the substrate specificity for s4U modification by deletion analysis of tRNAPhe, and showed that TPHE39A, consisting of 39 nucleotides (nt) including the acceptor-stem, a bulged loop, the T-stem, and the modified T-loop, was the minimal efficient substrate with activity nearly two-thirds that of full-length tRNAPhe, i.e., initial rate constant (kobs) and dissociation constant (Kd) of tRNAPhe and TPHE39A were 1.01 6 0.13 min¿1 and 1.9 6 0.17 mM and 0.61 6 0.06 min¿1 and 8.2 6 1.7 mM, respectively. It was also reported that: (1) the bulged loop must be at least 4 nt in length, and contain the target uridine as the first nucleotide; (2) the primary sequence in the T-loop is not a recognition element; and (3) a 39-CCA overhang is required for activity. These discussions were based on the assumption that tertiary structures should be retained even in truncated RNA molecules, although no evidence for this was obtained. In the present study, we investigated the RNA recognition mechanism using tRNAPhe and TPHE39A as RNA molecules, and ThiI from E. coli, N- and C-terminal domains of ThiI as proteins. Based on the results of X-ray crystallography, gel shift assay, isothermal titration calorimetry, and CD spectrometry, we propose a mechanism for the binding of ThiI with tRNA. RESULTS Crystal structure of TPHE39A Previously, TPHE39A (Fig. 1) was shown to be the minimal RNA fragment that can be modified by ThiI, although its activity was decreased by about 40% compared with that of intact tRNAPhe. TPHE39A consists of the acceptor-stem and the T-arm with the T-loop substituted by the artificial GAAA sequence, which are connected together with a 7-nt loop. In this study, the crystal structure of TPHE39A ∞ was determined at a resolution of 1.75 A by the SAD method using calcium ions and phosphate atoms as anomalous scatterers (diffraction data statistics are described in Table 1). The asymmetric unit contains one molecule of TPHE39A, one magnesium ion, one chloride ion, seven calcium ions, and 161 water molecules. Based on the intact tRNAPhe

structure, it has been suggested that TPHE39A should have a conserved secondary structure as shown in Figure 1B. In contrast to this expectation, TPHE39A revealed substantial alterations in the secondary structure of the T-stem. Figure 2B shows the superposition between TPHE39A and the full-length tRNA, in which all atoms in G1≠A9 were superposed. In tRNAPhe, the target uridine of ThiI, U8, forms a reverse Hoogsteen base pair with A14 and a hydrogen bond with A21 (Dirheimer et al. 1995). However, in TPHE39A, U8 flipped into the T-stem region and formed a base pair with A27, instead of U16, in the T-stem (Fig. 2C,D). This conformational change may be due to the absence of A14 and A21 in TPHE39A. As consequences of this unnatural U8≠A27 base pair, other Watson≠Crick base pairings in the T-stem region were mostly disrupted (Fig. 2D). G10≠G19 in the T-stem of TPHE39A (corresponding to G44≠G53 in tRNAPhe) together with the T-loop formed a large bulged loop structure, whereas this region forms the T-stem in tRNAPhe. By connecting to this large loop region, the 39-end of the 59 acceptor-stem region, i.e., the region of A7≠A9, was distorted by about 60∞ to the direction of the T-stem region (Fig. 2B). Most of magnesium and calcium ions were located around this bulged loop. Moreover, C14 and C15 formed base pairs with G18 and G20 in the bulged loop of an adjacent RNA molecule in the crystal. These resulted in the stabilization of a loop conformation, and reduced the crystallographic B factors compared to those of the acceptor stem. The contact interface between two TPHE39A ∞ molecules was calculated to be 777.7 A2, which is z10% of ∞ 2). A native gel, as well as a the whole surface area (7359 A gel filtration analyses, indicated the monomeric behavior of TPHE39A in the solution (data not shown). Since nucleotides in the bulged loop did not form intramolecular base pairs, it is possible that this loop has certain flexibility in solution. Several nucleotides exposed into solvent, i.e., C14,

C15, G18, and G20, would be incidentally stabilized by base pairings in crystals. Despite differences in the T-stem region, TPHE39A and tRNAPhe had quite similar structures in the acceptor∞ stem with a RSMD of 2.79 A for the 297 atoms that were compared. In conclusion, TPHE39A possessed a rod-like structure with canonical base pairings in the acceptor-stem and distorted conformation of the T-stem including the U8≠A27 base pair. Binding assay with truncated ThiI and tRNA To explore the RNA recognition mechanism of ThiI, we prepared two truncated forms of ThiI containing the N-terminal domain (NTD) including NFLD and THUMP, and the C-terminal domain (CTD) including the PP-loop and RLD, respectively (Supplemental Fig. S2), and subsequently verified their RNA binding ability by gel shift assay and the ITC method. Prior to the assays, their structural integrities were confirmed by CD spectra compared to that of the full-length protein (data not shown). Figure 3 shows the results of gel shift assays. In the cases of both intact ThiI and NTD, free RNA bands disappeared with the increase in protein concentration, suggesting that these proteins are capable of binding to tRNAPhe (Fig. 3A). In contrast, adding CTD did not affect the amount of tRNAPhe (Fig. 3A). Similar observations were also made in the case of TPHE39A (Fig. 3B). These results strongly suggest that NTD alone held the potential for RNA-binding activity. At the same time, the results also suggested that TPHE39A 1500

could be precisely recognized by ThiI regardless of the drastic structural changes in the T-stem as described above. Next, we measured the affinity of each protein with RNAs by ITC (Table 2). The association constants of ThiI against tRNAPhe and TPHE39A were (4.02 6 1.03) 3 106 and (1.80 6 0.44) 3 106 M¿1, respectively. While the value decreased to about 44% of the intact tRNA, TPHE39A possessed a certain binding capacity to ThiI. The affinity constants of NTD against tRNAPhe and TPHE39A were calculated to be (2.93 6 0.97) 3 106 and (2.12 6 0.60) 3 106 M¿1, respectively, which were 72.2% and 52.2% those of ThiI, respectively. The dissociation constants of ThiI against tRNAPhe and TPHE39A calculated from association constants determined by ITC were 0.25 6 0.06 and 0.56 6 0.14 mM, respectively, which were markedly smaller than those previously reported using a filter binding assay (1.9 6 0.17 and 8.2 6 1.7 mM, respectively) (Table 2; Lauhon et al. 2004). This would be due to the difference of the methods used. These values accord with each other in that Kd between ThiI and tRNAPhe is smaller than that between ThiI and TPHE39A. On the other hand, neither tRNAPhe nor TPHE39A bound to CTD in ITC experiments, consistent with the results of the gel shift assay (Fig. 3). Taken together, the substrate selectivity between ThiI and tRNA is likely governed by the specific interactions between the NTD and the acceptor-stem, respectively. Whereas the RNA affinity was not markedly affected, the thermodynamic parameters were remarkably altered by truncation of tRNA (Table 2). The enthalpy contribution on binding (DH) decreased from ≠9.27 to ≠2.08 kcal mol¿1 in the case of ThiI, and from ≠13.5 kcal mol¿1 to ≠1.18 kcal mol¿1 for NTD. On the other hand, the entropy contribution increased from ≠0.34 to 21.7 cal mol¿1 K¿1 for ThiI, and from ≠14.9 to 25.1 cal mol¿1 K¿1 for NTD. Figure 4 shows the breakdown of each interaction. These experimental values imply that interactions with tRNAPhe are enthalpy-driven in both cases of ThiI and NTD, whereas those with TPHE39A are mainly entropy-driven. In addition, deletion of the C-terminal domain of ThiI also caused significant changes in enthalpy and entropy contributions. Focusing on binding with tRNAPhe, the enthalpic contribution increased but that of entropy decreased. However, no such marked changes were observed in binding with TPHE39A. Circular dichroism spectra of tRNAPhe and TPHE39A in the presence or absence of proteins To confirm that structural changes of RNAs accompany ThiI binding, we measured circular dichroism (CD) spectra of RNAs in the presence or absence of ThiI and NTD. Figure 5A shows the results for tRNAPhe. Without ThiI, tRNAPhe gave positive CD between 245 and 290 nm with a peak around 265 nm, which was not observed for the proteins. Therefore, this peak likely reflected the conformation

was used, suggesting that the structure of TPHE39A was unaffected by protein binding. Taken together, these results lead to the conclusion that the structural change induced by the C-terminal domain should occur in regions that exist in tRNAPhe, but not in TPHE39A, or in those where the structure has deviated between tRNAPhe and TPHE39A. DISCUSSION Deduced RNA recognition mechanism of ThiI Despite a significant conformational change of the T-stem region, ThiI could bind to TPHE39A without a significant decrease in the affinity (Table 2). CD spectra showed that no significant structural change occurred in TPHE39A on binding with ThiI, which allowed us to discuss the binding mechanism between ThiI and TPHE39A based on the determined structure of TPHE39A. Taken together, these results indicate that the acceptor-stem region plays an important role in binding with ThiI, which is in good agreement with a previous FIGURE 2. Crystal structure of TPHE39A.

In TPHE39A, the T-stem was disrupted and formed a of tRNAPhe. Interestingly, the CD intensity of this region large bulged loop together with the T-loop sequences (Fig. increased slightly, but significantly when ThiI was added 2).

recognizing the acceptor-stem. The interaction between a minimal molecule pair, i.e., TPHE39A and NTD, was calculated as entropy-driven (Fig. 4; Table 2). Many nucleic acid≠protein interactions are assigned as entropy-driven, to which dehydration of nucleic acids makes a contribution (Jen-Jacobson et al. 2000; Privalov et al. 2007). The interaction between NTD and the acceptor-stem may also involve a dehydration effect. However, the breakdown of enthalpy and entropy contributions changed markedly upon truncation of tRNA (Fig. 4), i.e., the enthalpy driven interaction for tRNAPhe changed to an entropy-driven interaction in TPHE39A, suggesting that some regions other than the acceptor-stem also participate in binding. These regions may have enthalpic advantages but entropic disadvantages. It is remarkable that the interaction between NTD and tRNAPhe is enthalpically advantageous and entropically disadvantageous as compared with ThiI and tRNAPhe (Fig. 4). These changes must be derived from CTD. As the binding affinity did not decrease markedly and CTD could bind neither tRNAPhe nor TPHE39A, these enthalpic and entropic effects by CTD would be offset by each other almost completely. Taken together, we concluded that: (1) NTD is necessary for ThiI≠tRNA binding, (2) NTD recognizes the acceptorstem; (3) a region(s) other than the acceptor-stem is also recognized by NTD; and (4) CTD can also affect the interaction by favorable enthalpy and unfavorable entropy, but they are canceled out by each other. Structural changes in RNA over binding with ThiI CD spectra showed that CTD induces a conformational change in some region other than the acceptor-stem in tRNA (Fig. 5A). Spectral changes in this region were reported to indicate conformational changes of nucleic acid molecules (Connor et al. 1994; Gray et al. 1995; Nejedly et al. 2005; Saito et al. 2008). Gabant et al. (2006) reported for ThiI and other tRNA modification enzymes that some conformational

RNA binding mechanism of ThiI

MATERIALS AND METHODS Construction of expression vector for ThiI and truncated proteins
The gene encoding ThiI was amplified using KOD-Plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo), with E. coli genomic DNA as the template and the following primers: ThiI-S (59-AGCTATCCATATGAAGTTTAT CATTAAATTGTTC-39); and ThiI-AS (59-ATCAGATCTTACGGGCGATA TACCTTCACAT-39).
FIGURE 4. Breakdowns of thermodynamic parameters in each interaction pair. Gibbs energy, enthalpy change, and entropy change are shown as black, gray, and white bars, respectively.

rearrangement, such as base flipping in the substrate tRNA, must occur to expose the target nucleoside and place it in the active site. The crystal structure of ThiI from B. anthracis showed that CTD contains the catalytic core (Waterman et al. 2006). The conformational change detected on CD spectra may correspond to these rearrangements, i.e., base flipping of U8. In several DNA or RNA modification enzymes, base flipping upon enzyme≠DNA or enzyme≠RNA interaction was observed (Roberts and Cheng 1998; Ishitani et al. 2008). It is also likely that larger conformational change such as the l-form tRNA can occur upon ThiI binding (Ishitani et al. 2008). In either case, we cannot conclude this exactly at the present stage. CTD is necessary for the structural change; however, this domain requires NTD for binding to tRNA. As described above, CTD has some favorable enthalpic and unfavorable entropic effects for tRNA binding. These effects may contribute to the structural changes of tRNA. As the modification activity of TPHE39A by ThiI is almost twothirds that of tRNAPhe, this significant decrease in modification efficiency may be due to the loss of conformational change by CTD. Conclusions In this study, we examined the interaction between ThiI and tRNA on the basis of the crystal structure of TPHE39A, binding assays, and CD spectra. We demonstrated an RNA binding mechanism of ThiI in which NTD binds to the acceptor-stem region of tRNA, and CTD causes some conformational changes of tRNA. Our results showed that truncation of RNA causes some unexpected structural changes, and therefore RNA molecules should be designed carefully when using truncated molecules. A high-resolution structure of ThiI in complex with tRNA is essential to determine the precise binding and/or modification mechanism of ThiI. We now are attempting to prepare co-crystals of ThiI and RNA molecules. The present study provided some critical clues to understand the precise modification mechanism.

Restriction enzyme sites for digestion and ligation are underlined. The PCR products were inserted into the NdeI and BglII sites of the pET-Duet vector (Merck). To achieve a uniform reductive state of active cysteine residues in ThiI, i.e., C344 and C456, IscS, the sulfur atom donor for ThiI, was coexpressed with the pET-Duet vector. ThiI was expressed without any tags, but a hexahistidine tag was attached at the N-terminus of IscS for ease of isolation from ThiI on Ni-affinity resin. According to the crystal structure of ThiI from Bacillus anthracis, the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain of E. coli ThiI were defined as follows: NTD, Met1-Gln177; and CTD, Glu178-Pro482. Each gene was amplified from the ThiI expression vector with the following primer sets: For NTD: ThiI-N-domain-S (59-GGAATTCCATATGAAGTTTATCATTA AATTGTTCCCG-39), and ThiI-N-domain-AS (59-ACGCGTCGACCTGGGTGCCGATCG GGAA-39).

For CTD: ThiI-C-domain-S (59-GGAATTCCATATGGAAGATGTGCTG TCGCTCATTTCC-39), and ThiI-C-domain-AS (59-ACGCGTCGACCGGGCGATATACCT TCACATTG-39). After digestion with NdeI and XhoI, each gene was introduced into the pET-28b vector. A His6 tag was fused at the C-termini of both fragments for the purpose of purification. The correctness of the DNA sequences was confirmed using an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).

Expression and purification of ThiI and truncated ThiI
ThiI was expressed in E. coli strain B834(DE3) at 37∞C in LB medium supplemented with 100 mg mL¿1 ampicillin. To induce ThiI expression, isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added at the early stationary phase of culture to a final concentration of 1 mM, and culture was continued for another 3 h. Truncated ThiIs were expressed in E. coli strain B834(DE3) harboring pT-RIL (Stratagene) in LB medium containing 25 mg mL¿1 kanamycin and 34 mg mL¿1 chloramphenicol. The expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mM IPTG at the early stationary phase of culture and processed for 18 h at 25∞C. www.rnajournal.org

were indexed, integrated, scaled, and merged using the HKL2000 program package (Otwinowski and Minor 1997).

Structure solution and refinement
The initial phasing was achieved by SAD with the program SHELX (Sheldrick 2008). SHELXD identified 46 anomalous scatterer sites, including phosphate atoms and calcium ions using the substructure structure factors calculated by SHELXC. The initial electron density map was obtained after phase calculation and its improvement by density modification with the solvent contents of 0.45 using the program SHELXE. Twenty-seven of 39 nt were built automatically by the PHENIX package (Adams et al. 2002), and all bases except A39 were built manually using the graphical program Coot (Emsley and Cowtan 2004), based on the initial electron density map. Positional and individual B factor refinement of the TPHE39A model was carried out with the program REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al. 1997), using reflections ranging ∞ from 50 to 1.75 A. A random 4.9% of all observed reflections were set aside for cross-validation analysis and used for monitoring throughout the refinement by calculating the free R value (Rfree). The final model consisted of 39 nt, one magnesium ion, one chloride ion, seven calcium ions, and 161 water molecules with crystallographic R and Rfree values of 20.9% and 24.1%, respectively. The crystallographic parameters and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.

CD spectra were obtained by taking the average of four scans made from 400 to 190 nm and normalized to molar ellipticities by protein or RNA concentrations determined from absorption at 280 and 260 nm, respectively.

Data deposition
The atomic coordinates for TPHE39A have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession number 2ZY6.

Gel shift assay
Procedures to confirm interactions between protein and RNA molecules were, in principle, those followed by Nakamura et al. (2006). Gel shift assays were performed in 10-mL reaction mixtures containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 7 mM b-mercaptoethanol, and the desired amounts of tRNA and protein. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 25∞C for 15 min, and then immediately loaded onto a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel composed of 25 mM Tris-MES (pH 6.8), 0.5 mM DTT, 5 mM magnesium acetate, and 20 mM ammonium acetate. Electrophoresis conditions were as follows: temperature, 4∞C; power voltage, 60 V; and time, 4 h.

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
All ITC measurements were carried out with a VP-ITC System (MicroCal). Proteins and RNAs were dialyzed against 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.6) containing 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 7 mM b-mercaptoethanol, and then their concentrations were calculated from the absorptions at 280 and 260 nm, respectively. The cell was filled with z10 mM protein solution, and a syringe was filled with z100 mM RNA. The protein solution was injected 25 times in portions of 10 mL over 20 s. The data obtained were analyzed with the program ORIGIN (MicroCal). Thermograms and calculated thermodynamic parameters are shown in Supplemental Fig. S3 and Table 2. Breakdowns of Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy contributions are also shown in Figure 4.

Circular dichroism measurements
CD spectra were measured on a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter (JASCO) in a quartz cell with an optical path length of 2 mm. The
