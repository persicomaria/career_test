Perturbation of the human copper-transporter Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) causes intracellular copper accumulation and severe pathology, known as Wilson disease (WD). Several WD mutations are clustered within the nucleotide-binding subdomain (N-domain), including the most common mutation, H1069Q. To gain insight into the biophysical behavior of the N-domain under normal and disease conditions, we have characterized wild-type and H1069Q recombinant N-domains in vitro and in silico. The mutant has only twofold lower ATP affinity compared to that of the wildtype N-domain. Both proteins unfold in an apparent two-state reaction at 20 °C and ATP stabilizes the folded state. The thermal unfolding reactions are irreversible and, for the same scan rate, the wild-type protein is more resistant to perturbation than the mutant. For both proteins, ATP increases the activation barrier towards thermal denaturation. Molecular dynamics simulations identify specific differences in both ATP orientation and protein structure that can explain the absence of catalytic activity for the mutant N-domain. Taken together, our results provide biophysical characteristics that may be general to N-domains in other P1B-ATPases as well as identify changes that may be responsible for the H1069Q WD phenotype in vivo.

Introduction
Many proteins that participate in cellular respiration, antioxidant defense, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, connective tissue biosynthesis and pigment formation use copper as the prosthetic, active group.1­5 Since free copper is toxic, copper homeostasis in living organisms is tightly controlled by subtle molecular mechanisms.6­8 During the past decade, an important class of proteins, termed copper chaperones, has been identified in the cytoplasm that binds Cu(I) with Cys

coordination.5,9­12 These proteins guide and protect the copper ions within the cell, delivering them to the appropriate functional protein receptors. In humans, the copper chaperone Atox1 delivers Cu(I) to the ATPases ATP7A (i.e., Menkes disease protein) and ATP7B (i.e., Wilson disease protein) proteins.5,10,13 ATP7A and ATP7B are homologous membrane proteins, which use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to maintain intracellular copper concentration and to deliver copper to the secretory pathway, an essential step in the biosynthesis of copper-dependent enzymes.5,14 ATP7B has been found to export the anticancer drug cisplatin from vesicles from Sf9 cells, and thus seems to control the sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of this drug.15 The structural and biochemical basis of copper transport is poorly understood. ATP7A and ATP7B are members of the P1B subfamily of P-type ATPases and have an eight trans-membrane segment topology, an ATP-binding domain, six N-terminal metalbinding domains (that interact with Atox1) as well as

1098 other characteristic sequence motifs. The central step in the catalytic cycle of all P-type ATPases, including ATP7A and ATP7B, is the formation of a transient acyl-phosphate intermediate upon ATP hydrolysis. This reaction takes place in the ATP-binding domain. This domain is composed of two independently folded parts: the nucleotide-binding domain (Ndomain), which binds the nucleotide, and the phosphorylation domain (P-domain), which contains the catalytic Asp residue.16 The P-domain is highly conserved among all P-type ATPases and its structure consists of a parallel -sheet sandwiched between -helices. The Asp residue is positioned close to the hinge region connecting the P- and the Ndomains. In contrast to the P-domain, the N-domain has a distinct sequence and a characteristic set of residues involved in ATP binding. The ATP-binding environment in ATP7B's N-domain is proposed to involve residues H1069, G1099, G1101, I1102, G1149 and N1150 which are conserved only in the P1BATPase subfamily. The structure of the ATP7B N-domain was recently solved and consists of a sixstranded -sheet with two adjacent -helical hairpins.17 In both ATP7A and ATP7B, the N-domain contains a structural element that is absent from CuATPases from other organisms. In the solution structure of the ATP7B N-domain, this region is mostly unfolded;17 however, it is possible that it adopts a defined structure in the full-length protein. The location of the insert at the protein surface suggests a possible regulatory function, perhaps via inter-domain interactions with the metal-binding domains.17 Several diseases, including Menkes and Wilson diseases, are related to genetic defects in the Cu homeostasis proteins.18,19 Many mutations that result in Wilson and Menkes diseases are found in the respective ATP-binding domain.20,21 There are at least 40 missense mutations found in the N-domain of ATP7B that result in Wilson disease (WD).22 Among these is the most common WD mutation, H1069Q, which involves one of the residues near the ATP binding site.23 This mutation did not appear to change the overall N-domain structure in vitro, as judged by circular dichroism (CD) spectra and NMR data, but was proposed to prevent tight ATP binding.17,20 Nonetheless, the NMR study reported similar chemical shifts upon addition of ATP for wild type (WT) and mutant N-domains, suggesting that the mutant is still able to bind the nucleotide.17 In contrast, the mislocalization and degradation of the ATP7B H1069Q mutant in fibroblast cells suggested that this mutation affects protein folding. 24 Additional work suggested that at low temperature, the mutant remains folded but is deficient in ATP-dependent phosphorylation.21,25,26 In our initial in vitro experiments with purified ATP7B proteins, in contrast to earlier reports, we found that the affinity of the mutant N-domain for ATP was not much different from that of WT. This prompted us to search for other biophysical differences between the two proteins that could explain onset of WD in the case of H1069Q. Here, we report

the results of in vitro chemical and thermal unfolding experiments with recombinant WT and H1069Q N-domains as a function of ATP concentration. We find that the mutant has lower thermodynamic stability at 20 °C (pH 7) than the WT protein, and is less resistant to (irreversible) thermal perturbation. ATP increases the equilibrium stability of both variants at 20 °C (pH 7), as well as the kinetic barrier towards thermal unfolding. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal long-range differences between the proteins in terms of tertiary contacts and internal dynamics. Docking of ATP followed by MD simulations of the holo forms implies different ATP-binding modes in the two proteins: an altered position of the ATP phosphate may explain the lack of ATP hydrolysis activity in the case of mutation at position 1069.21,25,26

Results and Discussion
In vitro studies Affinity of WT for ATP and H1069Q Wilson disease N-domains Purified WT and H1069Q N-domains (17 kDa, 165 residues; residue 1069 in the full-length protein corresponds to residue 38 in the isolated N-domain) were found, as reported earlier,20 to be folded and have similar secondary structure contents as judged by far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra (not shown). Nucleotide binding to the WT N-domain has been reported; although the protein shows little discrimination between ATP, ADP and AMP, the nucleotide affinity is relatively high (i.e., high micromolar range) compared to the millimolar affinities observed for P2-ATPase N-domains.20 Upon ATP binding, the intrinsic tryptophan emission (W1154 and W122 in full-length protein and isolated Ndomain, respectively; positioned near the ATP-site) is quenched and thus the emission signal is a good tool for the detection of nucleotide binding. When ATP is titrated to a sample of WT N-domain (pH 7, 20 °C), we find the tryptophan emission to decrease and, at high concentrations of ATP, there is no further change, indicating that all ATP-binding sites in the N-domain are filled. Analysis of the data, using a single-site oneto-one binding model (Fig. 1), reveals an apparent dissociation constant (KD) of 166 ± 10 M (pH7, 20 °C). This value is similar to earlier reports for ATP binding to the WT N-domain: KD of 110 M, via fluorescence, and 75 M, using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).20 Next, we repeated the ATP titration experiments with the purified H1069Q variant of the N-domain using fluorescence as the detection tool. From the fluorescence quenching data (Fig. 1) we estimated KD for the mutant of about 344 ± 30 M (pH 7, 20 °C). This is only twofold higher than the WT KD (Table 1), which was surprising in light of an earlier proposal of KD higher than millimolar (based on no heat detected by calorimetry) for the mutant.20 Also,

1099 proteins unfold in single transitions, CD and fluorescence derived curves overlap, and the reactions are 100% reversible (Fig. 2). This suggests simple twostate equilibrium reactions and the data was fit to twostate equations providing midpoints and GU(H2O) values (Table 1). From the urea data in Fig. 2, it is clear that WT is more stable than H1069Q in the apo form (midpoints at 4.3 M versus 3.9 M urea; Table 1). Also, the GU(H2O) values from the urea experiments reveal a 2 kJ/mol difference in favor of WT. Addition of ATP increases the stability of both WT and the mutant, the largest effect is for WT: the urea midpoint shifts from 4.3 M to 4.7 M and the free energy increases by 3 kJ/mol. This implies that ATP dissociation occurs before unfolding and is coupled to protein unfolding. The stability data with and without ATP were analyzed using an equation derived by Schellman27 relating GU(H2O), the ligand-binding constant and the concentration of free ligand (ATP) (assuming two-state reactions and that the ligand binds only to the folded state). This analysis reveals that the affinity of the mutant for ATP is reduced twofold as compared to WT (Table 1); this is in good agreement with the fluorescence titration data.

Emission change at 330 nm versus the concentration of ATP is plotted for WT (open circles) and H1069Q (filled circles). Continuous lines are fits to the data assuming 1:1 binding (parameters are given in Table 1).

using chemical shift changes in the mutant's NMR spectrum upon ATP additions, a KD value of 1 mM was subsequently estimated. 17 Our mutant KD value, carefully determined using fluorescence, suggests that the difference between WT and H1069Q in terms of ATP affinity is less than reported previously. Effect of ATP on chemical stability of WT and H1069Q at 20 °C Chemical stability of WT and H1069Q N-domains at 20 °C (pH 7) was probed by chemical unfolding experiments using urea as a denaturant. The progress of the reaction was probed by far-UV CD (reporting on secondary structure content) and fluorescence (reporting on Trp environment). We find that both

Thermal stability differs for the two N-domain proteins Thermal unfolding of both proteins is completely irreversible and thus no true thermodynamic parameters can be derived. It appears that the proteins form intra- and/or inter-molecular disulphide bridges at the higher temperatures, as Ellman's assay before and after thermal denaturation revealed 4 and 0.5 available free thiols, respectively (the protein has five Cys). A negative correlation of protein thermal stability versus protein concentration also suggests aggregation as the main reason of thermal irreversibility (see the DSC section below). In Fig. 3a and b, we show the thermal transitions for each protein as a function of scan rate. The faster the scan rate the higher the apparent thermal midpoint (Tm) suggests that the unfolding process is kinetically controlled. The mutant is less stable than the WT N-domain at each scan rate.

In the presence of ATP, the thermal midpoints shift to higher temperatures for both WT and H1069Q N-domains (Fig. 3c and d), suggesting that ATP binds to the folded state, as expected. Addition of threefold excess Mg2+ (as MgCl2) with 1 mM ATP had the same effect as 1 mM ATP alone (not shown), in accord with an earlier observation that Mg2+ is not required for ATP binding to the N-domain.20 Moreover, ADP had the same effect on thermal stability as ATP, suggesting that both nucleotides are capable of stabilizing the folded state to the same extent (data not shown). Based on the apparent two-state behavior, the thermal data were analyzed by a two-state irreversible model N  I, where N is the native and I is the irreversibly denatured states. This mechanism assumes that only N and I states are populated significantly.28 The Tm values for different scan rates were plotted as described in Methods (Fig. 4) to estimate Ea (activation energies) for each set of data (i.e, for WT and H1069Q at 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 mM ATP). Since the

In Vitro and in Silico Studies of ATP7B N-domains

1101 plots in Fig. 4a and b are linear, the assumed two-state irreversible mechanism appears valid, at least as a first approximation. We find Ea to be higher for WT than for H1069Q in the absence of ATP (300 kJ/mol versus 220 kJ/mol; Fig. 4c), revealing that the mutant is more kinetically labile. This is in accord with the higher Tm values for WT as compared to H1069Q at each scan rate. ATP kinetically stabilizes the folded state in both cases, as the unfolding barrier is increased. Moreover, the stabilizing effect of ATP is larger for WT as compared to the mutant (Ea 515 kJ/ mol versus 350 kJ/mol in 1 mM ATP; Fig. 4c), suggesting that ATP binds more tightly to WT. In a recent study, known Ea values for irreversible (N  I) protein denaturation reactions were compiled.28 Based on 54 proteins and their 98 Ea in various solvent conditions, the mean Ea of the entire data set was 354 kJ/mol. Comparison to our Ea values reveal that whereas the WT N-domain Ea value (without ATP) is near the average, the mutant N-domain is in the lowest 38% of the reported values. Also, with 2 mM ATP, the Ea value for the WT N-domain is among the highest 7% of the reported values. Calorimetry reveals two-step thermal reactions for the N-domains Whereas CD monitors thermally-induced changes in the protein secondary structure, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) monitors thermally-induced processes accompanied by heat absorption or release that generally provides more detailed information. In agreement with the CD data, DSC thermograms show kinetically driven irreversible processes in which the midpoints shift to higher temperatures with faster scan rates (Fig. 5). Rescans of heated protein samples revealed no heat of reaction; this is in accord with thermal unfolding being totally irreversible. Again, the mutant is less thermally stable than WT and the stabilizing effect of ATP towards heat perturbation is greater for WT. Analysis of the thermograms as described29 indicates that the transitions, although appearing twostate-like with single symmetrical peaks, contain two underlying steps (insets in Fig. 5). This is in accordance with previous analysis by Lyubarev and Kurganov, who showed that two consecutive irreversible steps can be "hidden" within one visible DSC peak.30 We find that the first step, at the lower temperatures, depends on the presence of ATP, whereas the second step, at higher temperatures, does not. This suggests that the first DSC step is ATP dissociation and protein unfolding. The DSC transitions exhibit protein concentration dependence: the higher the protein concentration, the lower the Tm (Fig. 5c). This indicates that aggregation of nonnative protein conformations takes place at high temperatures and is the main reason for thermal irreversibility. This is in agreement with our finding of heat-induced cysteine oxidation causing intra- and inter-protein bonds (noted above). Therefore, the second DSC step likely corresponds to aggregation of unfolded polypeptides. We note that the CD-detected thermal curves

appeared as two-state processes. Likely the first DSCdetected step is what is probed by CD (the CD data also show ATP-concentration dependence and loss of secondary structure); the subsequent protein aggregation step may not be detected by far-UV CD. Rate constants for the two steps could be obtained from analysis of the DSC data. These rate constants were extrapolated to 37 °C and then converted to lifetimes (i.e.,  = ln 2/k) to estimate the kinetic stability of WT and mutant N-domains at physiological temperature (Table 2). From the values, it is clear that: (i) the rate-limiting step is the first step (i.e., ATP dissociation and protein unfolding); and (ii) the mutant has a much shorter native-state lifetime than WT, both without and with ATP. This finding may

1103 (1114­1143 in the full-length protein) is highly flexible in both WT and H1069Q. Interestingly, the mutation does not only produce a local effect, but instead the effect extends throughout the protein. Several studies have shown that point mutations can alter protein structural and dynamic properties far away from the site of the mutation.31­34 In general, the mutant is more dynamic than the WT, especially in helices 1, 2, 3, and 4. The mutation is located in the loop connecting helices 1 and 2, and the latter loses secondary structure in the H1069Q protein (Fig. 7c). Helices 3 and 4, which are located far away from the mutation, adopt different orientations, and both helices lose some secondary structure; in particular, 4 that is also rotated by 90° with respect to the WT. In contrast to the rest of the protein, the unique loop is more rigid in the mutant. Excluding the unique loop,

silico generated H1069Q mutant (see Methods). The backbone root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) with respect to the average structure as a function of the simulation time shows that both proteins are stable in the last 20 ns (Fig. 6a). Therefore, these last 20 ns were used for data analysis. The average rmsd was 2.3 ± 0.3 Å and 3.2 ± 0.4 Å for WT and H1069Q, respectively, indicating no major conformational change. However, it is clear that the mutant is more dynamic than WT. The distribution of structures obtained from the last 20 ns of MD simulations, after the system reached equilibrium, was compared to the initial structures by computing the rmsd per residue (Fig. 7a). As expected, structured regions, such as -helices and -sheets, fluctuate less than loop-rich regions. In particular, the unique loop that corresponds to residues 83­112

1104 the WT protein is significantly more compact and smaller than the mutant, as judged on the basis of the radius of gyration (RG) data (mean values 15.4 Å for WT and 16.2 Å for the mutant; Fig. 7b). This difference in size between the two proteins arises mainly from the different orientation adopted by helices 1­4 in the mutant, which significantly opens the protein. It is particular interesting that the mutation has an effect even in the apo form, as seen in our in vitro experiments, meaning that H1069 contributes to maintain the integrity of the fold. In accord, we found that in the WT, H1069 maintains a -cation interaction with Arg7, which is located in a position preceding the 1 strand. This interaction in the WT N-domain is present throughout the 20 ns production MD simulation and keeps helices 1 and 2 in correct conformation close to the 2 and 3 strands. The mutant is not able to make this -cation interaction, therefore,

In Vitro and in Silico Studies of ATP7B N-domains

helices 1 and 2 are positioned further away from strands 2 and 3, opening the overall structure. Altogether, the higher flexibility and more open conformation of the mutant correlate with the lower chemical and thermal stability observed in vitro. It has been reported that various H1069 mutants exhibit slight increases in proteolytic sensitivity as compared to the WT N-domain, suggesting that point mutations at this position induce increased flexibility and/or exposure of certain peptide regions.21 These earlier findings can be explained on a molecular level by our in vitro and in silico results. In silico differences between WT and mutant holo forms ATP was docked into the NMR structure of WT and the mutant was generated in silico (see Methods).

1105 interfere with conformational changes during the catalytic cycle. Moreover, the unique loop is, on average, more extended in the holo mutant, being more folded in the holo WT. It has been suggested that the loop may have a regulatory function by mediating inter-domain interactions in the fulllength protein, for example, with the metal-binding domains.17,37 Interestingly, we found opposite loop dynamics for the mutant with respect to the WT. Whereas this loop is more structured in the mutant in the absence of ATP, it becomes more flexible in the presence of ATP, with respect to the WT. It is tempting to speculate that domain­domain interactions mediated by this loop will cause miscommunication in the mutant. Finally, on average, the two holo proteins have similar size (without the unique loop) (Fig. 8b), although the mutant is somewhat more extended, as in the apo form. Differences in ATP binding for WT and mutant proteins So far, we focused our analysis on differences between WT and H1069Q N-domains in the absence and in the presence of ATP. We are also interested in

These holo-structures were subjected to 40 ns MD simulations. Both structures were stabilized faster than the apo-forms, because the starting NMRstructure is in the presence of ATP, and because we observe that ATP stabilized the folded state in vitro. The backbone rmsd evolution through time shows that both proteins are stable in the last 20 ns (Fig. 6b), with mean values of 2.1 ± 0.2 Å and 2.2 ± 0.3 Å for WT and H1069Q, respectively. These last 20 ns were used for data analysis. In general, and similar to what we observed for the apo structures, the holo mutant is more flexible than the holo WT protein, as shown by the higher rmsd per residue (Fig. 8a). However, the differences are smaller than those seen in the apo forms. The regions that are most affected are the unique flexible loop and helices 3 and 4; all of these regions become significantly more floppy in the mutant (Fig. 8a). The orientation of helix 4 again differs by  90° between the proteins (Fig. 8c), similar to what seen in the apo forms. Because these helices are close to the interface between the N- and P-domains in the P2-type sarco (endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA)35,36 and the bacterial P1B-type ATPase CopA,16 it is possible that different arrangement of these helices may

1106 structural and dynamic changes upon ATP binding for each protein individually. In WT, binding of ATP shrinks the protein, with a difference in average RG (RG) of  0.7 Å (excluding the unique loop). We notice that in the apo form there are two dominant conformations: the most extended is most visited (Fig. 7b). In the holo form, only the most compact conformation is populated (Fig. 8b). Thus, it appears that ATP "locks" the protein in one of two conformations. Moreover, in general, ATP binding reduces the flexibility of the protein (Fig. 9a). Interestingly, the unique loop becomes significantly structured upon ATP binding (more than twofold reduction in rmsd). It was not possible to detect any change in this loop upon ATP binding by NMR.17 In contrast, we show here that the conformation of the loop is tuned by the presence of ATP (Fig. 9a). Induced strain in the protein core due to greater rigidity in the loop might facilitate subsequent conformational changes and inter-domain communication during the catalytic cycle. On the other hand, there are regions of increased disorder upon ATP binding, such as half of helices 1 and 2, their connecting loop that contains H1069, and helix 4. These regions include residues that are conserved in P1B-type ATPases and may facilitate conformational transitions between domains. In the H1069Q mutant, ATP also makes the protein more compact, with a RG of 1.8 Å (without the unique loop). In this case, the apo and holo forms do not overlap in size. ATP binding reduces backbone flexibility throughout the protein, and the change is more significant in helices 1 and 2, and their connecting loop (Fig. 9b), as opposed to the WT. Interestingly, whereas ATP binding induces disorder near residue 1069 in the WT, it produces the opposite effect in the mutant. Surprisingly, and in contrast to the WT, the unique loop is largely unaffected by ATP binding to the mutant. This suggests that the H1069 residue is important in regulating dynamics of the unique loop (despite being distant in space), with implications for inter-domain interactions. Alterations in proteolysis patterns of H1069 mutants21 also suggest global structural changes upon a point mutation. Furthermore, there are other examples (such as the glucocorticoid receptor34 and the prion protein38) where point mutations affect the dynamics of floppy regions far away from the site of mutation. The free energy (G) of ATP binding was estimated for the last 20 ns of simulations (see Methods), yielding values of -28.0± 2.5 kJ/mol and -22.6± 2.1 kJ/mol for the WT and H1069Q protein, respectively. This further indicates that ATP binding to the mutant is significant and cannot be neglected (both G values correspond to micromolar ATP affinities). Because these G calculations neglect configurational entropy, the change in quasiharmonic entropy upon ATP binding at 300 K (TS) was estimated (see Methods). As expected, TS for both proteins were negative, indicating that binding of ATP reduces the number of degrees of freedom of the proteins, as discussed above. Interestingly, (TS), defined as the difference in TS of H1069Q minus WT is 18.4 kJ/

mol, meaning that ATP binding orders the WT protein to a greater extent than the mutant. This can explain the lack of heat found upon addition of ATP to the mutant in ITC experiments;20 ATP binding to the mutant may be mostly entropically driven. ATP coordination differs in WT and mutant proteins Although the NMR structure of the N-domain was solved in the presence of ATP, it was not possible to determine the detailed ATP coordination.17 Residues that interact with ATP were proposed on the basis of chemical shift changes upon ATP binding.17 However, changes in chemical shifts do not necessarily imply that those residues bind directly to ATP nor provide details of the interactions between the nucleotide and the protein. Here, a docking calculation followed by MD simulation provides a good platform to elucidate the molecular details of ATP binding to the N-domain. Interestingly, we found different ATP-binding modes for WT and H1069Q (Fig. 9c and d); i.e. ATP binds in different orientations in the proteins. In WT, ATP is oriented such that the adenine ring is in close proximity to H1069, making a stacking interaction. The sugar ring is stabilized by van der Waals interactions with Ser1067 and by strong hydrogen bonding to Glu1064 (Fig. 9c). The phosphate tail, especially the  and  phosphates, is mostly exposed to the solvent, without having significant contacts with the protein. This is consistent with ATP and ADP having similar affinities and similar NMR chemical shifts upon nucleotide binding.17 On the other hand, ATP is rotated  180° in the mutant; the 2­3 sheet serves as a hydrophobic "pocket" where Ala1096, Gly1099, Gly1101, and Ile1102 interact with the adenine ring. As in the WT, the sugar ring is stabilized by strong hydrogen bonding with Glu1064, although in a different orientation (Fig. 9d). Even though the phosphate tail is mainly solvent-exposed, as in the WT, the  phosphate maintains a hydrogen bond with Gln1069. This observation is consistent with H1069A mutation having a stronger negative effect than H1069Q or H1069C, suggesting that a residue capable of providing a hydrogen bond is better tolerated.21 In all cases, the interactions mentioned above were maintained throughout production of the MD simulations. In agreement with our findings, it has been suggested, on the basis of phosphorylation measurements, that H1069 is important for orienting the ATP molecule towards the catalytic Asp.21 The ATP coordination observed here for the WT agrees well with previous experimental observations. Even though the 2­3 sheet do not contact the ATP directly, the residues located here are close to the ATP molecule and may be important for creating a proper environment, as seen by NMR chemical shift changes.17 Previously, it was not possible to clarify the roles of His1069 and Glu1064 in ATP coordination by NMR experiments.17 These are invariant residues proposed to participate in ATP binding.20 In our model, both His1069 and Glu1064 are involved in strong energetic interactions with ATP.

1107 interaction between the adenine ring and the H1069 sidechain. In H1069Q, ATP binds in a different orientation, preventing a correct conformational change, and impairing phosphorylation. Replacement of this conserved His to Gln may alter the interaction between the N- and P-domains, trapping the protein in an intermediate state between the E1 and E2 states.43 We note that, although the above reasoning provides an explanation for the WD phenotype in the case of H1069Q ATP7B, the story may be more complex. We found H1069 to be important even in the absence of ATP, as it contributes to the integrity of the fold by maintaining a -cation interaction with Arg7. The absence of this interaction in the mutant may explain its less compact conformation and, thus, its lower level of chemical and thermal stabilities found in vitro. We found in our MD simulations that the unique to mammalian N-domains loop in both proteins has different dynamic behavior between the WT and mutant proteins. This loop has been proposed to facilitate intra-protein domain­domain interactions in ATP7B.37 Thus, the presence of H1069Q in ATP7B may result in miscommunication, in addition to lack of phosphorylation and thereby Cu transport, in WD patients. Missense mutations that cause WD can alter different properties of ATP7B (such as protein stability, nucleotide binding, protein­protein interactions, protein localization and trafficking) that ultimately result in loss of function. It has been found that the E1064A mutation results in complete absence of ATP binding, whereas the C1104F mutation results in an unfolded protein.20 We found that the H1069Q variant has lower ATP affinity and lower chemical and thermal stabilities compared to WT, although the differences are not dramatic. We found differences also in protein dynamics, and in ATP coordination. Therefore, we conclude that the net effect of the H1069Q mutation is a sum of subtle changes, and that H1069 is important for correct ATP orientation and subsequent phosphorylation. The clinical manifestations of WD patients carrying the H1069Q mutation are diverse, making it difficult to develop a genotype­phenotype correlation.44­46 This clinical heterogeneity, together with our findings, may suggest that other genetic and/or environmental factors enhance one or more of the H1069Q defects to different degrees in different patients.

We note that Glu1064 is crucial for ATP coordination in WT and in the mutant. This correlates with the finding of complete loss of ATP binding in an E1064A mutant of the N-domain.20 Ser1067 is invariant in almost all the P1B-type ATPases, except in ZntA, where it is replaced by Ala. This residue is close to the ATP sugar moiety in our simulations, although it makes no important interaction. It is possible that the role of Ser1067 is to position His1069 and Glu1064 correctly for proper ATP binding. We note that the conformation of ATP binding to the isolated N-domain may not be the same as that in the presence of the P-domain. To address this issue, we modeled 39­42 the structure of the ATP-binding domain (i.e., both N- and P-domains together) of ATP7B using the available N-domain solution structure17 and the SERCA structure bound to an ATP analogue35 as a model for the P-domain (not shown). ATP was docked into this model, followed by in silico mutation of residue 1069, and 15 ns MD simulations. Our preliminary simulations support the same ATP coordination in the two-domain proteins as observed in the isolated N-domains, for both WT and H1069Q. This further suggests that the main effect of the H1069Q mutation is a different ATP binding mode and not the lack of cofactor binding.

Conclusions
To provide molecular explanations of previous in vivo observations, we have characterized WT and H1069Q N-domains in vitro and in silico. First, in contrast to earlier suggestions,20 we find that both variants bind ATP with less than threefold difference in affinity in vitro. Thus, lack of ATP binding in H1069Q is not the major effect causing WD. Both N-domains unfold in reversible reactions upon chemical perturbations at 20 °C, and WT has greater thermodynamic stability. Upon thermal perturbation, the behavior of the variants clearly differs: WT is more resistant to heat than the mutant, and ATP has a greater "protective" effect on the WT than on the H1069Q N-domain, which is explained by a higher activation barrier towards unfolding. This supports earlier in vivo work that suggested that the H1069Q mutation results in a temperature-sensitive protein deficient in folding at elevated temperatures.24 The MD simulations provide a molecular explanation of the in vitro observations and reveal that the mutant structure is more dynamic and "open". When ATP was docked into the apo structures, followed by MD simulations, we find that the resulting ATPcoordination geometries differ in the two proteins. Thus, as speculated earlier, alteration of ATP coordination in the binding pocket of the N-domain can explain why catalytic phosphorylation is greatly reduced in various H1069 mutants.21 In SERCA, ATP binding produces a conformational change that brings the P- and N-domains into close contact, inducing phosphorylation of the catalytic Asp. We speculate that ATP will induce a similar conformational change in ATP7B, facilitated by the stacking

Materials and Methods
Protein preparation WT and H1069Q variants of the ATP7B N-domain genes in pTYB12 vectors were kindly provided by Dr Svetlana Lutsenko (Oregon Health & Science University). Protein expression and purification was performed as described.20 ATP-binding experiments The WT or H1069Q N-domain (10 M in 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 20 °C) was titrated with increasing

1108
concentrations of ATP up to 3 mM. ATP binding was monitored via quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence upon binding (excitation at 295 nm; emission at 330 nm; Varian Eclipse fluorimeter). Protein dilution after addition of ATP was corrected for. The data were expressed as protein fluorescence with respect to that in the absence of ATP (set as 0), and data were fit to a single binding site model to estimate the dissociation constant, KD. Chemical unfolding experiments Urea-induced unfolding was performed in 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 20 °C, with 13 M protein and with or without the presence of 2 mM ATP. All samples were incubated for 2 h followed by far-UV CD (200­250 nm; Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter) and fluorescence (excitation 295 nm; emission 300­500 nm) spectroscopic measurements. Changes in CD at 222 nm and in emission ratio (360 nm/330 nm) overlapped, in agreement with twostate unfolding processes. All reactions were fully reversible. The data were fit to standard equations for two-state reactions47 to reveal the thermodynamic parameters midpoints and GU(H2O). Thermal unfolding experiments Thermally induced unfolding of WT and N1069Q N-domains was performed in 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, with 13 M protein at four different concentrations of ATP (0, 0.5, 1 and 2 mM). Unfolding was monitored by CD at 222 nm and 225 nm in the absence and in the presence of ATP, respectively. All reactions were irreversible. To estimate thermal midpoints (Tm), the data were fit to a two-state model.48 To study the scan rate-dependence of Tm, five different scan rates () were tested: 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 K/min. Assuming a two-state irreversible unfolding model, N  I, the data were fit to the following equation, which allows estimation of the apparent activation energy, Ea:29   t Ea ln 2 ¼ constant À ð1Þ RTm Tm DSC experiments DSC experiments were performed on a VP-DSC differential scanning microcalorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, MA) at three different scan rates (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 K/min) for WT and H1069Q N-domains. The scans were performed in the absence and in the presence of 2 mM ATP for protein concentrations of 43 M (pH 7). Additional experiments with 10 M and 86 M WT N-domain were also performed to investigate protein concentration-dependence. Before measurements, sample and reference solutions were properly degassed in an evacuated chamber for 5 min at room temperature and carefully loaded into the cells to avoid bubble formation. Exhaustive cleaning of the cells was undertaken before each experiment. A pressure of 2 atm (1 atm = 101,325 Pa) was kept in the cells throughout the heating cycles to prevent degassing. The transitions were irreversible in all cases, as indicated from an absence of the endothermic peak in a second heating cycle performed immediately after cooling from the first scan. Analysis of the irreversible DSC transitions was performed as described.29 The calculation of the activation energy and the rate

Generation of structures for molecular dynamics simulations Computer simulations (see below) were performed starting from the NMR structure of the WT apo N-domain solved in the presence of ATP (2ARF.PDB17). The apo H1069Q mutant was generated in silico. The holo forms were generated by docking ATP onto the NMR structure using AUTODOCK 4.0,49,50 followed by in silico mutation to obtain holo H1069Q. The parameters employed for ATP and the macromolecule were taken from AUTODOCK 4.0 standard parameterization. The Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm was applied as a search method for the different docking results.49 We performed 200 docking calculations that were collected using the cluster analysis approach included in the package (rmsd tolerance of 2 Å). We selected the lowest-energy structure from the most populated cluster (third cluster with 18 members) as starting-point structure for MD simulations. MD simulations The initial structures were: apo WT (2ARF.PDB) and H1069Q (generated in silico from 2ARF.PDB), and holo WT and H1069Q obtained after ATP docking into the NMR structure as described above. Hydrogen atoms were added favoring H-bonds.51­54 The protonation state of the titratable residues corresponds to the stable form at pH 7. Na+ atoms were added to neutralize the systems by computing the total electrostatic potential on a grid.51­54 The systems were immersed in a pre-equilibrated truncated octahedral cell of TIP3P explicit water molecules.55 Water molecules extended at least 9 Å from the surface of the proteins. These structures were generated using the leap module of Amber9.51­54 Classical MD simulations were performed for the different proteins using Amber9.51­54 Protein atoms were described with the parm99SB force field parameterization.56 The parameters for the ATP molecule were those reported in the Amber web page.57 Simulations were performed in the NPT ensemble, using periodic boundary conditions. A constant pressure of 1 atm and a temperature of 300 K were maintained using the Berendsen coupling scheme.58 A SHAKE algorithm was employed to keep bonds involving hydrogen atoms at their equilibrium length,59 which allowed us to use a 2 fs time-step. The optimized systems were heated to 300 K and equilibrated for 200 ps. The resulting structures were the starting points of the production MD simulations. Apo simulations were run for 60 ns, whereas holo simulations were run for 40 ns. The last 20 ns were used for data analysis. The rmsd fluctuations per residue and the radii

In Vitro and in Silico Studies of ATP7B N-domains of gyration (RG) were calculated for each of the systems using the ptraj module of Amber9. The ATP binding free energies (G) for the protein­ATP complexes were estimated using the sietraj program.60,61 This program calculates G for snapshot structures from the MD simulation with a rigid infinite separation of the protein and nucleotide.60 G is the sum of the intermolecular van der Waals and Coulomb interactions plus the change in reaction field energy (determined by solving the Poisson­Boltzmann equation) and nonpolar solvation energy (proportional to the solvent-accessible surface area).60 G is then scaled by an empirically determined factor, obtained by fitting to a training set of 99 protein­ ligand complexes.60 The scaling can be considered a crude treatment of entropy­enthalpy compensation, but still contains the caveats of implicit solvation and neglect vibrational entropy.60,62 Here, we estimated G averaging 100 structures from the last 20 ns. The configurational entropy change upon ATP binding was estimated by calculating the quasiharmonic entropy,63­65 using the ptraj module of Amber9. In this approach, the atomic fluctuation matrix is calculated as the mass-weighted covariance matrix obtained from the snapshots of the MD simulation. The structures obtained from the simulations were spatially superimposed onto a common reference structure to exclude all translational and rotational motions exhibited by the molecule.66 The calculation was performed for the backbone heavy atoms (C, O, C, and N) as a reduced representation of the system.
