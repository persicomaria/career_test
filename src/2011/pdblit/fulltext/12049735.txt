Abstract Four structural domains are characteristic of the members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The hinge (D) domain which is located between the DNA binding (C) domain and the ligand binding (EF) domain, is less conserved among the nuclear receptors. In this study, we investigated the effects of the D domain on receptor function with regard to ligand binding, protein­protein interaction and DNA recognition. We found that EF domain of TR lacked T3 binding activity and additional D domain was required for its ligand binding. Using pull down assays and two-hybrid assays, we also demonstrated that the EF domain of TR did not dimerize with TR or RXR in solution, while the DEF domain was able to homo-and heterodimerize with RXR. In contrast, the RXR EF domain alone was able to heterodimerize with TR. The D domain of TR is required but that of RXR is not necessary for the interaction. We further demonstrated that the D domain was required for receptor specific DNA recognition. The ABC domain of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and TR(DEF) chimeric receptor could not bind to VDR response element (VDRE). Addition of own D domain of VDR to the ABC domain enables the chimeric receptor to bind VDRE and transactivate. The D domain of TR cannot substitute for that of VDR in context of specific DNA recognition. These data suggest that the D domain is important to maintain the integrity of the functional structure of the nuclear receptors. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Thyroid hormone(T3) effects on a wide variety of tissues are mediated via specific nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TR), which are the cellular homologues of v-erbA (Sap et al., 1986; Weinberger et al., 1986). Several isoforms of TRs and TR variants have been isolated and shown to be members of a gene superfamily, which includes steroid, retinoic acid (RAR), vitamin D (VDR) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR). Two TR genes, a and b, have been identified, and both genes encode several protein variants through alternative mRNA splicing (Izumo and Mahdavi, 1988; Lazar et al., 1988; Murray

et al., 1988; Thompson et al., 1987). The thyroid hormone receptors, as well as other members of the superfamily, regulate transcription by binding to response elements containing two or more copies (often degenerate) of the consensus motif AGGTCA (Glass et al., 1987). It has been shown that RAR, TR, VDR and PPAR form heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR) on bipartite hormone response elements composed of non-symmetrical head-to-tail tandem AGGTCA `half sites' (Kliewer et al., 1992; Leid et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 1992). It was reported that the interaction between TR and RXR occurred through their ligand binding domain (LBD) before DNA targeting and the ligands facilitated the interaction (Kakizawa et al., 1997). This dimerization function is believed to stabilize the complex and promote the recognition of DNA. Several heptad repeats in LBD

are well conserved among the members of the erbA related nuclear receptor family and have been proposed to form a hydrophobic surface that might act as a receptor dimerization interface (Evans, 1988; Forman et al., 1989), which is structurally similar to the leucinezipper dimerization domain found in Jun-Fos (Landschulz et al., 1988). The heterodimerization influences the recognition of DNA targets and confers specificity for a defined spacing between two directly repeating hexameric sequences. Deletion of heptad repeats abolished the trans-activation function of the receptor (Glass et al., 1989; Holloway et al., 1990). Nuclear receptors exhibit a modular structure with functionally separable domains (Evans, 1988). Similar to other members of nuclear receptors, TRs have four structural subdomains (A/B, C, D and EF) (Beato, 1989; O'Malley, 1990). Although the domain organization of the steroid hormone receptors has been studied, the function of the hinge domain is incompletely understood. The most highly conserved C domain, which forms two `zinc fingers' serves as the sequence-specific DNA binding domain (Evans and Hollenberg, 1988). The EF domain has a complex structure with both hormone binding and dimerization activities (Evans, 1988; Beato, 1989; Forman et al., 1989). More elusive are the roles of the A/B and D domains, where the low level of sequence similarity among various receptors might reflect a lack of functional conservation. The A/B domain, which is essential for the transcriptional properties of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Giguere et al., 1986; Hollenberg and Evans, 1988) can be deleted from the TR without impairing their function (Lin et al., 1991). However, the length and primary structure of the D domain are conserved in all cellular and viral erbA gene products. Mutagenesis of the D domain has no apparent functional consequences for the estrogen receptor (ER) (Kumar et al., 1986, 1987) but reduces the transcriptional activation properties of the GR, without affecting its hormone-binding activity (Giguere et al., 1986). Indeed, inclusion of this domain seems essential for T3-binding of TRs (Lin et al., 1991). Mutations in the corresponding region of v-erbA inactivates its transforming activity (Damm et al., 1987; Boucher et al., 1988). These suggest that integrity of the D domain is important for the function of the corresponding proteins. The transcriptional regulation of nuclear hormone receptors involves the participation of the basal transcription factors, including TATA-binding protein and TFIIB (Ing et al., 1992), and other cofactors known as nuclear receptor coactivators or corepresssors. In the absence of ligand, DNA bound nuclear receptors recruit corepressors, N-CoR and SMRT (Chen and Evans, 1995; Horlein et al., 1995), whereas in the presence of ligand, corepressors dissociate and coactivators such as CBP/p300 (Chakravarti et al., 1996), SRC-

1/NCoA-1 (Kamei et al., 1996; Onate et al., 1995; Torchia et al., 1997), TIF-2 (Voegel et al., 1996)/GRIP1 (Hong et al., 1996)/NCoA-2 (Torchia et al., 1997), p/CIP (Torchia et al., 1997), SUG1/TRIP1 (Lee et al., 1995; vom et al., 1996) and RIP140 associate to the receptor heterodimers (L'Horset et al., 1996). N-CoR box, which bound nuclear corepressors, have been identified in the D domain of TR (Horlein et al., 1995), suggesting that the structural change of the EF domain by ligand binding led to the altered conformation to dissociate the co-repressor from the D domain. This indicates the presence of intra-molecular cross-talk between these regions. Recent crystallographic analysis revealed that N-terminus residues of D domain of rat TRa1 make extensive contacts with the minor groove of DNA in the structure of TR-RXR heterodimers on hormone response element suggesting important role of D domain in DNA binding of heterodimers. However, the functional significance of these structural determination has not been verified. In this study, we used a molecular biological approach to show that the hinge domain of TRa1 is required for hormone binding and thus transcriptional activation. More importantly, we demonstrated that hinge domain was also required for heterodimerization of TR to RXR and specific DNA recognition.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Construction of plasmids
In order to produce the expression vectors for VDR(ABCD)-TR(DEF) or VDR(ABC)-TR(DEF), the ABC or ABCD domain of the VDR, and the DEF domain of TRa1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequentially cloned into BamHI­ XhoI site and XhoI-XbaI site of pCDNA3.1-HisC (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), respectively. To introduce the BamHI and XhoI sites into the 5% and 3% ends of the ABC coding sequence of hVDR, pAVDR, which contains the entire coding region of hVDR cDNA (Baker et al., 1988), was amplified by PCR using following synthetic oligonucleotide primers: A, 5%-ATCGGATCCATGGAGGCAATGGCGGCC-3%; and B, 5%-ATCCTCGAGCATGCCGATGTCCACACA-3%. Primer A contains the BamHI site (GGATCC) followed by coding strand sequence at the N-terminus of hVDR. Primer B includes the XhoI site (CTCGAG) and the C-terminus of C domain coding sequence of hVDR. After digestion with appropriate enzymes, PCR products were inserted into the BamHI­XhoI site of pCDNA3.1-HisC to produce the pCDNAVDR(ABC). To produce pCDNAVDR(ABC)TR(DEF), PCR amplified DEF domain of TRb1 containing XhoI­ XbaI site was inserted into XhoI­XbaI site of

pCDNA3.1VDR(ABC). Similar strategy was used to produce pCDNA3.1VDR(ABCD)TR(DEF). The presence of the correct insert was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. To construct the eukaryotic expression vectors, the EF and DEF domain of human TRa1 and RXRa were PCR amplified and cloned into pGEX6P (Phalmacia LTD) in frame which produce GST TR(EF), GST TR(DEF), GST RXR(EF), and GST RXR(DEF) proteins. Similar strategy was applied to construct mammalian two-hybrid vectors, expressing Gal4 fusion and VP16 fusion proteins.

of chimeric receptors and wild-type receptor were determined by Western blotting using rat polyclonal antibody raised against the DNA binding domain of the nuclear receptor (Macchia et al., 1990) and equivalent amounts of proteins were used.

2.4. Expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli
To express the fusion protein with GST, overnight cultures of E. coli BL21 carrying the recombinant GSTfusions were diluted 100-fold, cultured for 5­6 h, and then induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). After another 3 h, bacteria were collected, washed with PBS. Pellets were suspended in PBS containing 1% (v/v) TritonX-100 and sonicated. Debris was removed by centrifugation. The fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and extensively washed with PBS containing 1% (v/v) TritonX-100. Matrix bound proteins were used for interaction experiments.

2.2. Cell culture and transient transfection and reporter assays
COS1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 mg/ml penicillin, and 0.25 mg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2. Transfection was done in COS1 cells using the standard calcium phosphate procedure. Typically, 0.25 mg of indicated luciferase reporter was co-transfected with 2 ng of the indicated expression vectors and 0.1 mg of CMV bgalactosidase expression vector. Cells were incubated for 12 h, and the medium on the cells was replaced with fresh medium and 10 - 7 M T3 or 1,25 OH-D3 was added. Cells were harvested after 24 h. b-galactosidase activity was measured by the method earlier described using chlorophenolred-b-D-galactopyranoside (CPRG) as a substrate. Luciferase assays were performed by Lumat LB9501 (Berthold Japan K.K., Tokyo, Japan) using the PicaGene Luciferase Assay System (Toyo Inki, Tokyo), and the luciferase activities were expressed as relative light Units (RLU) normalized to the b-galactosidase activity. Each transfection was conducted in triplicate, and data represent the mean9S.D. of more than three individual experiments. VDRE E1b luciferase reporter plasmid was earlier described (Rachez et al., 1998).

2.5. In 6itro transcription and translation
Coupled transcription and translation of proteins were carried out using a T7 TNT in vitro transcription/ translation kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

2.6. Interaction experiments
In vitro translated 35S-labelled proteins (1­2 ml) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with glutathione­Sepharose (10 ml) preloaded with GST- fusion or GST control protein in 250 ml of binding buffer (20 mM Tris ­Cl, pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM leupeptin, 1 mM pepstatin, 2 mg/ml aprotinin). After extensive washing with binding buffer, bound proteins were eluted in 25 ml Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 10 min and resolved by sodium dodesylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE 10%) followed by autoradiography. The results of the in vitro reactions and the amount of 35S-labelled proteins bound by GST fusion proteins were visualized and quantified using a Phosphor Imager (Fuji BAS 1500).

2.3. Expression of recombinant NRs in COS1 cells
Cells transfected with expression vectors for VDR, VDR(ABCD)TR(DEF) or VDR(ABC)TR(DEF) were harvested 48 h after transfection by centrifugation at 800× g for 10 min and washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Washed cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5% Triton X-100 containing SMT (0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM Tris­ Cl pH 8.0) and homogenized with teflon-glass homogenizer. Nuclear pellet were washed with SMT buffer and extracted with buffer A (20 mM Tris­ Cl, pH 7.5 containing 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMFS and 20% glycerol). Supernatant containing recombinant receptors was used for further experiments. The amounts

2.7. Gel mobility shift assay
Gel mobility shift assays were carried out as described in several reports (Kakizawa et al., 1999; Miyamoto et al., 1999). In standard conditions, synthetic oligonucleotides representing each strand of VDRE containing directly repeated AGGTCA sequence spaced by three nucleotides were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, eluted, and an-

nealed. Double stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabelled with [32P] dCTP ( \ 3300 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) by fill in reactions using Klenow large fragment DNA polymerase. Labeled probes were separated from unincorporated nucleotides by centrifugation through a Sephadex G-25 column, which was equilibrated with 10 mM Tris­ Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA and 150 mM NaCl. Radiolabelled probes (10 fmol, 20 000­30 000 cpm) were then incubated with appropriate cell extracts in 7.5 ml of reaction mixture containing 10 mM KPO4 pH 8.0 buffer, 1 mM EDTA, 80 mM KCl, 33 mg/ml polydI-dC, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 167 mg/ml BSA and 10% glycerol. These reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and analyzed on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of 200 V at 4°C in the same buffer. Gels were dried under vacuum and analyzed using a Phosphor Imager (Fuji BAS 1500).

associate with C-terminus of TR ligand binding domain in a ligand-dependent manner. Consistent with ligand binding data, GST-TR(EF) chimeric protein did not show a ligand-dependent interaction with SRC-1, while GST-TR(DEF) exhibited apparent T3-dependent association to SRC-1 (Fig. 2). All construct showed some degree of non-specific binding, because SRC-1 somehow tended to bind to beads itself (data not shown).

3.2. Role of the D domain of TR and RXR in homoand heterodimerization
We next studied the role of the D domain of TR in homo- and heterodimerization activity using bacterially expressed and purified GST-TR(DEF), GST-TR(EF) and GST-TR(D) fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, 35 S-labelled in vitro synthesized RXRa specifically associated with GST-TR(DEF), but not with GST-TR(EF) nor GST-TR(D), indicating the important role of the configuration of the DEF domain in the interaction between TR and RXRa. It is noted that the D domain or EF domain itself did not interacted with RXRa and that D+ EF configuration makes overall structure to interact with RXR. Furthermore, 35S-labelled in vitro synthesized TRa1 also associated with GST-TR(DEF), but not with either GST-TR(EF). These results together indicated that the structural integrity of the DEF domain would be important in the interaction, although the D or EF domain itself failed to hetero- or homodimerize with RXR. Above results in the pull down assays were further confirmed by mammalian two-hybrid system in which the interaction was assessed by the ability to transactivate a UASx4 luciferase reporter. As shown in Fig. 4, COS1 cells transfected with the expression plasmids for the DEF region of RXR fused to VP16 activation domain (VP16-RXR(DEF)), and the EF region of TR fused to Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4-TR(EF)) did not activate the reporter above the background either in the presence or absence of 9cis RA, whereas the cells transfected with the combination of VP16-RXR(DEF) and Gal4-TR(DEF) showed significant increase in reporter activity. TR(EF) could not interact with either liganded or unliganded RXR(DEF). Moreover, combination of VP16-RXR(DEF) and Gal4-TR(D) did not increase the reporter activity (data not shown). These results are consistent with the results from in vitro pull-down assays showing the requirement of the D+EF confuguration of TR in TR/RXR heterodimerization. Next we analyzed the role of the D domain of RXR in TR/RXR heterodimerization. In contrast to the significant role of the D domain of TR in the homo- and heterodimerization with RXR, similar amounts of 35Slabelled TRa1 specifically associated with GSTRXR(EF) and GST-RXR(DEF) in pull down assays (Fig. 3). The results were also confirmed by a two-hy-

3. Results

3.1. The D domain is essential for transcriptional regulation and T3 binding
The hinge domain (D domain) of the nuclear receptors was defined on the basis of a lack of sequence homology compared with the DNA binding domain and the ligand binding domain. First we defined the region (residues 120­188) of the human TRa as the D domain. This region extends from the C terminus of the DBD through herix 1 and herix 2 and terminates before the biginning of herix 3 of TRa LBD. To assess the effects of the D domain in ligand binding activity of human TRa1, 125I-T3 binding activity in the nuclear extracts from COS1 cells transfected with Gal4TR(DEF), Gal4-TR(EF) (Fig. 1A) or wild-type TRa1 was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1B, Gal4-TR(EF) completely lost T3 binding activity, whereas Gal4TR(DEF) possessed similar T3 binding activity as the wild-type receptor. Loss of T3 binding by the Gal4TR(EF) is absolute not relative, because no specific T3 binding was observed above the background even in the presence of increasing amounts of T3 (data not shown). To confirm the defective T3 binding activity of EF domain of TR, ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of chimeric receptors was analyzed in transient transfection assays using Gal4 binding site(UAS) luciferase reporter co-transfected with Gal4-TR(DEF) or Gal4-TR(EF). As shown in Fig. 1C, Gal4-TR(EF) showed no detectable luciferase reporter activation by 10 - 7 M of T3, whereas Gal4-TR(DEF) showed significant induction of luciferase activity by T3. Furthermore, we analyzed the ability of TR chimeric proteins to interact with SRC-1, a cofactor that is known to

Assays of binding of [125I]T3 to chimeric receptors were performed as earlier described (Ichikawa and DeGroot, 1987). About 10 ml of the nuclear extracts of COS1 cells expressing indicated chimeric receptors were incubated with 50 pM [125I]T3 (Dupont-New England Nuclear, Boston, MA) in 300 ml of 20 mM KPO4, pH 8.0, 400 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM MgCl2 at 22°C for 2 h. Dowex anion exchange resin was used for separation of bound T3 from free T3. Equivalent amounts of Gal4 fusion proteins were confirmed by western blotting analysis using GAL4 antibody. (C) UASx4 TK luciferase reporter were co-transfected into COS1 cells with indicated Gal4 chimeric receptor. After 24 h incubation with 10 - 7 M of T3, relative luciferase activities in the absence (solid bar) or presence (hatched bar) of T3 are presented after being normalized by the internal control for b-gal activities. Each transfection was conducted in triplicate, and data represent the mean 9 S.D. of more than three individual experiments.

COS1 cells transfected with expression plasmids for VP-TR(DEF) and Gal4-RXR(EF) showed similar increase in reporter activity to the cells transfected with combination of VP-TR(DEF) and Gal4-RXR(DEF). It was also demonstrated that Gal4RXR(EF) interacted with both VP-RAR(DEF) and VP-VDR(DEF). Above results indicate that in the context of heterodimerization with RXR, the D domain of TR is required but that of RXR is not essential.

3.3. VDR(ABC) -TR(DEF) chimera did not exert T3 -dependent transcriptional acti6ity on VDRE
VDR(ABC)-TR(DEF) chimera was created and its transcriptional activity on VDRE containing luciferase reporter was assessed(Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, VDR(ABC)-TR(DEF) did not exert T3-dependent

transcriptional activity on VDRE, in spite of its T3 binding and heterodimerization activity with RXRa (Fig. 2). We tested the DNA binding activity of VDR(ABC)-TR(DEF) to VDRE in gel shift assay and found that this chimeric receptor did not bind to VDRE. To understand the structural determinants responsible for impaired DNA binding activity of this chimeric receptor, we hypothesized that the D domain of VDR might be necessary for efficient DNA binding of VDR to VDRE. To further confirm these, VDR(ABCD)-TR(DEF) that contains D domains of both VDR and TR was constructed and tested for its

ability to bind DNA(Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 6, addition of the D domain of VDR to VDR(ABC)TR(DEF) restored its DNA binding activity. The cell extracts containing VDR(ABCD)-TR(DEF) formed complexes on VDRE with endogenous RXR with similar potency to the wild type VDR. Presence of equivalent amounts of wild-type and chimeric receptors in the assays was confirmed by T3 binding and western blot analysis using a specific antibody (Macchia et al., 1990) against the DNA binding domain of nuclear receptor (data not shown). These results indicate that the proper DNA binding of VDR to VDRE needs its own D

domain. We further tested the ability of VDR(ABCD)TR(DEF) to activate the VDRE containing reporter. As shown in Fig. 5B, VDR(ABCD)-TR(DEF) possessed similar ligand-dependent transcriptional activity on the VDRE E1b luciferase to the wild type VDR in agreement with in vitro DNA binding data.

4. Discussion On the basis of genetic experiments and DNA sequence homologies, nuclear receptors have been assigned functional domains, A-EF (Evans, 1988; Beato, 1989; O'Malley, 1990). The C domain has been shown to contain two zinc fingers for sequence specific DNA binding and dimerization on the DNA (Evans and Hollenberg, 1988). The D domain links these to the postulated hormone binding domain (EF) and is thought to be involved in nuclear localization of the receptors. The EF domain has been thought to be required for ligand binding, transcriptional activation and dimerization (Spanjaard et al., 1991). Recent stud-

ies demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal sequence of TR was critical for its association with RXRs (Kliewer et al., 1992; Leid et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 1992). In this report, however, we demonstrate that the EF domain alone does not possess ligand binding or dimerization activity, and that the additional D domain at the N-terminus of the EF domain plays an essential role in its function. The D domain of the nuclear receptor plays an important role in ligand binding, DNA binding, homodimerization and heterodimerization with RXR. Our results are in good agreement with the report by Lin et al. that demonstrated the importance of the D domain in T3 binding using bacterially expressed TRb1 (Lin et al., 1991). They reported that deletion of amino terminal 42 amino acids of the D domain completely abolished the ligand binding activity with significant reduction of CD spectra in stoichiometric analysis. The deletion of the D domain significantly reduced the cooperative structural interaction in TR molecule. Interestingly, a naturally occurring point mutation (A229T) in the hinge domain was reported to have an impaired T3 binding activity (Behr and Loos,

1992). Refetoff's group also reported two mutations in TR, R243Q and R243W, associated with resistance to thyroid hormone (Yagi et al., 1997), supporting the importance of the hinge region in ligand binding. To date, two distinct dimerization surfaces were proposed in the DNA binding domain (DBD) and ligand binding domain (LBD) of TR. The surface in the DNA binding domain conferred selective power in DNA dependent dimer formation and D domain was also reported to be involved in this interaction (Rastinejad et al., 1995). In contrast to the interface within the DBDs, dimerization motifs in the LBDs permit the heterodimeric complex subsequently to interact with response elements. C-terminal ligand binding domain is responsible for DNA-independent dimerization, which in vitro allows performation of certain dimers in solution before DNA targeting. This dimerization function is believed to stabilize the complex and promote the recognition of DNA. Several heptad repeats in EF domain are well conserved among the members of the erbA related nuclear receptor family and have been proposed to form a hydrophobic surface that might act as a receptor dimerization interface (Evans, 1988; Forman et al., 1989), which is structurally similar to the leucine-zipper dimerization domain found in Jun-Fos (Landschulz et al., 1988). In this study, we demonstrated that D domain of TR is also involved in this

interaction and plays an essential role in maintaining the overall configuration of LBD for the interaction. Interestingly, the D domain of RXR, however, was not involved in the TR/RXR heterodimerization in solution. It is somehow surprising that in the context of TR/RXR heterodimers the D domain of TR but not RXR is required for the interaction between the two proteins. The D domain of TR was identified as a binding site for nuclear receptor co-repressor, N-CoR or SMRT (Chen and Evans, 1995; Horlein et al., 1995), which did not associate with the D domain of RXR. Upon ligand binding, the D domain of TR produced allosteric changes promoting dissociation of co-repressor suggesting the presence of the intra-molecular communication between the D domain and EF domain of TR in TR/RXR heterodimers. Moreover, the D domain of VDR is also required for its specific DNA binding and cannot be substituted by the D domain of TR, suggesting the D domain also involved in specific DNA contact in nuclear receptors. VDR needs its own D domain for specific DNA binding. As the D domain is poorly conserved between different members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, the function of this domain may be unique to specific nuclear receptor subtypes. Crystallographic analysis of rat TRa1 ligand binding domain revealed that the first amino acids of N-terminus of (Met122­Gln156) are not visible in the electron density map (Renaud et al., 1995). Amino acids corresponding to Met122 to Ile 151 of the rat TRa1 make extensive contacts with the minor groove of DNA in the structure of TR/RXR heterodimers on hormone response element. It is also reported that amino acids of the D domain of ER up to 30 residues C-terminal to the zinc-fingers absolutely required for formation of gel retardation complexes by ER on estrogen responsive element (Mader et al., 1993). These observation, together with our results, strongly suggest that N-terminus of the D domain must be involved in specific DNA contact in the context of TR/RXR. Interestingly, Hadzic et al. reported that the certain amino acids in the A/B domain also affect DNA binding and dimerization of chicken TRa (Hadzic et al., 1998), and Zhu et al. also reported that interplay of the domains mediate differential transactivation activities of TR (Zhu et al., 1997). These observations support the notion that these domain may influence the overall structure and function of TRa, thus, play a role in determining the distinct context-dependent transactivation potentials of TR. Functional importance of interdomain `cross-talk' in nuclear receptor has been reported (McPhie et al., 1993; Liu et al., 2000). Our observations indicate that the ligand binding domain and hinge domain must have a particular conformation by intra-molecular interaction. Indeed, Kurokawa et al. reported that ligands do not cause

dissociation of N-CoR from TR or RAR in solution, and they reported that ligand-dependent dissociation of N-CoR required the particular conformation of the receptor heterodimers in the configuration of the DNAbinding site to which RAR/RXR heterodimers bind (Kurokawa et al., 1995). The lengths of the D domains among nuclear receptors differ significantly, however, they are well conserved among the isoforms of individual receptors. The hinge domain is poorly conserved and does not have a clearly defined structure at least as seen in some of the crystallography performed on both the DBD and the LBD. This suggests that the D domain may have a particular role in individual nuclear receptor. At present, it is unclear how, mechanistically, the D domain subserves the integrity of the functional structure of the nuclear receptor. It would be important to determine the conservation of charge, hydropathy, general structure or even perhaps solution structure, which contribute to the specificity of individual nuclear receptor.
