Pyrococcus furiosus phosphoglucose isomerase (PfPGI) is a metal-containing enzyme that catalyses the interconversion of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P). The recent structure of PfPGI has confirmed the hypothesis that the enzyme belongs to the cupin superfamily and identified the position of the active site. This fold is distinct from the aba sandwich fold commonly seen in phosphoglucose isomerases (PGIs) that are found in bacteria, eukaryotes and some archaea. Whilst the mechanism of the latter family is thought to proceed through a cis-enediol intermediate, analysis of the structure of PfPGI in the presence of inhibitors has led to the suggestion that the mechanism of this enzyme involves the metal-dependent direct transfer of a hydride between C1 and C2 atoms of the substrate. To gain further insight in the reaction mechanism of PfPGI, the structures of the free enzyme and the complexes with the inhibitor, 5-phospho-D-arabinonate (5PAA) in the presence and absence of metal have been determined. Comparison of these structures with those of equivalent complexes of the eukaryotic PGIs reveals similarities at the active site in the disposition of possible catalytic residues. These include the presence of a glutamic acid residue, Glu97 in PfPGI, which occupies the same position relative to the inhibitor as that of the glutamate that is thought to function as the catalytic base in the eukaryal-type PGIs. These similarities suggest that aspects of the catalytic mechanisms of these two structurally unrelated PGIs may be similar and based on an enediol intermediate.

which phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) activity has been identified.2,3 P. furiosus phosphoglucose isomerase (PfPGI) is a metal-containing enzyme which catalyses the reversible isomerisation of D-glucose 6-phosphate and D-fructose 6-phosphate.4 The enzyme is a homodimeric protein, with each subunit consisting of 189 amino acid residues of 21.5 kDa. The recent structure determination of PfPGI has shown that it is a member of the cupin superfamily,4­6 as previously predicted on the basis of sequence analysis.2,3 PfPGI thus represents a new class of PGI, which is completely unrelated to the aba sandwich fold,7 also referred to as an SIS

650 domain,8,9 which is adopted by eukaryotic,10,11 prokaryotic12 and some archaeal13 PGIs. The polypeptide chain of PfPGI starts with a short b strand, which forms an additional strand on the cupin barrel of the adjacent monomer (Figure 1), providing a clear example of a domain-swapped dimer. The chain continues through an a-helix into two b-sheets, containing three and six b strands, respectively, arranged to form a characteristic deep pocket which in the cupin superfamily often contains a metal-binding site. The chain is completed by an a-helix and two b strands, which pack against the three-stranded b-sheet, and lead to the C terminus. Like other members of the cupin superfamily, the active site of PfPGI lies in the cupin barrel adjacent to the metal-binding site.14 The isomerisation reaction catalysed by PGI, involves hydrogen transfer between the C1 and C2 positions of the substrate, and is thought to proceed through one of two mechanisms, based on either a direct hydride shift or proton transfer through an active site base via a cis-enediol intermediate.15 Results from extensive studies on eukaryal-type PGIs have suggested that catalysis in these enzymes proceeds through the cis-enediol mechanism in a metal-independent process.15 In contrast, Swan and co-workers have suggested that PfPGI catalyses isomerisation through a direct hydride shift,5 in which a crucial role is played by a catalytic metal ion (a first row transition ion, most probably Fe2C)4,5 in the stabilisation of the intermediate that is generated in the catalytic cycle. If correct this suggests that the presence of the metal would be critical for activity, which is supported by some biochemical data,5 but inconsistent with work published elsewhere.2 In order to contribute to the resolution of this ambiguity in the mechanism we have determined crystal structures of the complex of PfPGI with the inhibitor 5-phospho-D-arabinonate (5PAA) in the presence and absence of Mn2C, the transition metal showing the highest reported activity,4 and compared these structures with the structure of the free enzyme and with that of the equivalent complexes of the eukaryotic PGIs.

Results and Discussion
The structures of both metal-free and Mn2Ccontaining PfPGI/5PAA complexes were deter° ° mined to 1.5 A and 1.9 A, respectively, and the ° structure of the free enzyme to 2.8 A resolution. Overall comparisons of these structures reveal that they are similar to each other with no major structural differences between the respective protein backbones. The two subunits in the asymmetric unit of the P212121 crystal form of the free enzyme show root-mean-square (rms) alpha carbon deviations for the core of the enzyme, defined as 165 out of the total 189 residues using the program ° ° ESCET,16 of 0.51 A and 0.46 A, respectively, when overlapped with the coordinates of the single subunit in the asymmetric unit of the C2 crystalform of the metal-free complex with 5PAA. The structures of metal-free and Mn2C-containing complexes of PfPGI with 5PAA crystallise in the same space group and have an rms alpha carbon ° deviation of 0.14 A for the core of the enzyme. The structure of the metal-free PfPGI/5PAA complex ° We recently described the 2 A resolution structure of PfPGI.4 The crystals used for the structure determination were grown in the presence of 50 mM 5PAA. Initially, the position of the inhibitor could not be identified and the structure was thought to represent that of the free enzyme. ° However, subsequently, data to 1.5 A resolution were collected from the same crystal and refinement has revealed the unambiguous location of bound 5PAA (Figure 2). The earlier failure to locate the ligand was due to the automatic assignment of solvent molecules in the initial refinement to the position adopted by a number of the oxygen atoms of the 5PAA. The increased resolution has enabled the identification of the C-terminal residue (Lys189), which was located in a region of poor electron density in the original structure and an additional N-terminal methionine, which is not part of the sequence of the wild-type enzyme but which arises from the cloning strategy. Within the active site of PfPGI, the phosphate group of 5PAA lies adjacent to Tyr52 OH, His88 Nd1 and Tyr160 OH and the main chain NH of Gly87, which coordinate the phosphate oxygen atoms of ° the inhibitor through interactions of 2.41 A to O3P, ° ° ° 2.96 A to O2P, 2.51 A to O1P and 2.96 A to O2P, respectively (Figure 3). The phosphate oxygen atoms, O2P, O5 and O3P also form hydrogen bonds with two water molecules (W1 to O2P ° ° ° (2.74 A) and O5 (3.34 A) and W2 to O3P (2.60 A)), which, in turn, are hydrogen bonded to the protein ° ° (W1 to His136 O (2.97 A), W2 to Tyr52 OH (3.03 A) ° and Arg25 N32 (3.49 A)). Each of the three hydroxyl groups of 5PAA interact either directly or via water-mediated contacts with the protein (Figure 3). The O4 hydroxyl of ° 5PAA forms interactions with Thr71 Og1 (2.71 A)

Finally numerous van der Waals contacts can also be seen between the side-chain and/or main-chain atoms of Val54, Ala69, Thr85, Gly87, Tyr152 and Ala150 and the bound 5PAA. The structure of the free enzyme The free enzyme of PfPGI crystallises in the same conditions as those previously described for the crystals of the binary complex with 5PAA,17 but without the added inhibitor. However, the crystals belong to a different space group (P212121) with two subunits in the asymmetric unit. The structure was ° determined to 2.8 A resolution by molecular replacement using the structure of the symmetrygenerated dimer described above as the search model. The rms deviation between the two subunits ° is 0.33 A for the core of the enzyme. Comparison of the residues in the active site region of the two subunits reveals a shift in b5 resulting in the ° displacement of His88 by approximately 1 A between them (Figure 4). The most significant structural change between the active site region of the free enzyme to that of the metal-free/5PAA complex is a movement of the backbone of the enzyme around residues Gly87 and His88, which lie adjacent to the phosphate moiety of 5PAA in the metal-free/5PAA complex. Compared to the latter, His88 Ca in the two subunits in the asymmetric unit of the crystals of the free enzyme ° show maximal displacements of 1 and 2 A, respectively. A major consequence of the structural change is that it creates sufficient space for the 5PAA moiety to bind (Figure 4). In the absence of the movement, adverse steric contacts would be formed between

the side-chain of His88 and the O1 of the carboxyl group of 5PAA. The Mn2C-containing PfPGI/5PAA complex To further understand the active site geometry in PfPGI, crystals of a complex of PfPGI and 5PAA with Mn2C were grown and the structure refined to ° 1.90 A resolution. In the final electron density map clear density could be seen for both 5PAA and Mn2C. The manganese ion is coordinated octa° hedrally by the protein ligands His88 N32 (2.43 A), 32 ° ), Glu97 O31 (2.29 A) and His136 ° His90 N (2.65 A ° ° N32 (2.30 A), a water molecule, W7 (2.27 A), and the ° O1 carboxyl oxygen of 5PAA (2.42 A) (Figure 4). Both the conformation and position of 5PAA in this structure are essentially the same as in the metalfree 5PAA complex, including the position of each of the seven water molecules (W1 to W7) surrounding the 5PAA (Figure 4). The structure of the Mn2Ccontaining 5PAA complex is very similar to that reported by Swan and co-workers 5 of a complex of PfPGI with bound 5PAA and nickel (PDB: 1QXR 5). In the Mn2C-containing 5PAA complex the sidechain of Glu97 adopts a different rotamer compared to that seen in the metal-free 5PAA complex (Figure 4), with the torsion angle around c1 differing by approximately 1208. This movement creates space for the metal to bind and form an interaction to one of the carboxyl oxygen atoms (O1) of 5PAA. The other carboxyl oxygen of 5PAA (O1A) forms a close interaction with one of the carboxyl ° oxygen atoms of Glu97 (OE2, 2.24 A), as observed in the structure of the metal-free 5PAA complex, again suggesting that these two carboxyl groups share a proton. In the Mn2C-containing 5PAA complex the

653 Reaction mechanism A prerequisite for the isomerisation of G6P and F6P is that the sugar is in a ring open form. In order to contribute to an understanding of the mechanism of rabbit PGI its structure has been determined in the presence and absence of inhibitors and substrate.11,18­21 In the structure of the complex of rabbit PGI with F6P (PDB: 1HOX18), the side-chain ° of His388 lies adjacent to F6P O5 (3.0 A) and is thought to act as the proton donor for ring opening.18 In the rabbit PGI 5PAA complex (PDB: 1G9819) the spatial equivalence of the 5PAA O4 hydroxyl to F6P O5 has been used to suggest that the former mimics the position of the latter. Whilst currently we do not have a structure for PfPGI with F6P the position of the 5PAA O4 hydroxyl in our structures might allow us to identify residues that could flank the O5 hydroxyl of F6P and therefore participate in ring opening. Analysis of the 5PAA complexes of PfPGI reveals that the closest residue that could act as a base is Tyr99 and, even here, the ° phenolic oxygen is somewhat remote, being 4.2 A from the 5PAA O4 hydroxyl. Thus the enzyme appears to lack a good candidate for the general base and this has led to the suggestion that PfPGI might selectively bind the straight chain form of the substrate,5 which would be increasingly favoured at equilibrium at the extreme growth temperatures required by P. furiosus.5 In the hydride shift mechanism for PfPGI

° side-chain of His136 moves 1.6 A compared to the position it adopts in the metal-free 5PAA complex. This movement is achieved through rotation of c1 from 748 to 438. As a result the hydrogen bonding around this side-chain is different in these two structures. In the Mn2C-containing complex N32 ° forms one of the ligands to the metal ion (2.33 A), breaking the hydrogen bond that was formed between N32 and the O1 carboxyl oxygen of 5PAA ° (2.89 A) in the metal-free 5PAA complex (Figure 4). In the Mn2C-containing 5PAA complex His136 Nd1 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of ° Trp134 (2.69 A), breaking its previous hydrogen ° bond to W112 (3.13 A) (Figure 4). Finally, in the 2C Mn -containing 5PAA complex we note that residues Gly87 to Phe89 are in an equivalent position to those in the metal-free 5PAA complex, but different from the free enzyme, consistent with the movement in this part of the structure being due to 5PAA binding. Currently, PGIs with a fold related to that of the cupin superfamily have only been identified in species belonging to Thermococcales, where a high level of sequence similarity (e.g. 83% identity between the PGIs from T. litoralis and P. furiosus) is observed. Nevertheless all the amino acid residues involved in binding the metal and the 5PAA moiety are conserved between these two enzymes and structural superimposition of PfPGI and T. litoralis PGI (PDB: 1J3P, unpublished data) reveals that their positions are very similar.

proposed by Swan and co-workers,5 a key feature of the catalytic activity is an essential role for the enzyme-bound transition metal ion. The earlier observation that the metal ion was not apparently required for activity of PfPGI2 argued against such a mechanism. However, we have re-analysed the activity of the enzyme following metal depletion by incubation of PfPGI with 10 mM EDTA at 70 8C for 20 minutes. This resulted in complete loss of activity, which could be regained by subsequent addition of 100 mM MnCl 2, following buffer exchange to remove the EDTA (Table 2). In the complex of rabbit PGI with the inhibitor 5-phospho-D -arabinonohydroxamate (5PAH) (Figure 6), the nitrogen and carbon atoms of the ° ° hydroxamate group of 5PAH are 3.1 A and 3.4 A, respectively, from one of the carboxyl oxygen atoms of Glu357, the putative catalytic base in this class of PGIs. This has led to the suggestion that these two atoms of the hydroxamate group mimic the positions of the C1 and C2 carbon atoms of the cis-enediol intermediate, such that it is possible to envisage a plausible proton transfer mediated by the glutamate side-chain.21 The structure of the complex of rabbit PGI with 5PAA19 is similar to that with 5PAH with one of the carboxyl oxygen atoms ° of 5PAA forming a close interaction (2.8 A) with one of the carboxyl oxygen atoms of the putative

catalytic base (Glu357), implying that these two atoms share a proton.19 Superimposition of the P. furiosus and rabbit PGI/5PAA complexes based on equivalencing the inhibitor, shows that relative to the position of the 5PAA carboxyl group, there is a spatial equivalence of the carboxyl group of Glu357 in rabbit PGI and Glu97 in PfPGI (Figure 5). The spatial conservation in PfPGI of the glutamate that is thought to act as the catalytic base in rabbit PGI, together with the similarity of its close interaction with the carboxyl group of the inhibitor, suggests that the cis-enediol mechanism that operates in the rabbit enzyme could also be employed in PfPGI. If this is the case then the role of the metal in the P. furiosus enzyme could be to stabilise the developing charge on the intermediate, rather than to participate in hydride transfer. Further evidence in support of a cis-enediol mechanism for PfPGI comes from a comparison of the structure of PfPGI with phosphomannose isomerase (PMI), whose structure is also based on a zinc-containing cupin fold.22 PMI catalyses the reversible isomerisation of D-mannose 6-phosphate and D-fructose 6-phosphate by a process that involves hydrogen transfer between the C1 and C2 positions of the substrate. Clearly, overall this reaction is closely related to that of PGI. Comparison of the structure of Bacillus subtilis PMI (PDB:

CCD using a rotation range of 1.08 per image. The PfPGI/ 5PAA Mn2C-containing complex and the free -enzymecontaining crystals were flash cooled to 100 K and data were collected on a MAR345 image plate detector using platinum/nickel mirror focused CuKa X-rays, produced by a Rigaku RU200 rotating-anode generator using a ° ° rotation range of 1.08 per image to 1.90 A and 2.8 A, respectively. The data were processed using the HKL package.24 Subsequent handling of the data was performed in the CCP4 suite.25 Analysis of the PfPGI/5PAA metal-free complex data showed poor completeness at low resolution due to overloading of the strong reflections. To overcome this the metal-free 5PAA complex data were scaled and merged using SCALEPACK,24 with a previous dataset collected ° from the same crystal to 2 A4 (Table 1). The refined model of PfPGI (PDB: 1PLZ4), which had been obtained using ° these 2 A data and in which no 5PAA had initially been identified, was used to initiate refinement with REFMAC5.26 Examination of the electron density of the PfPGI-5PAA metal-free and Mn2C-containing complexes produced evidence for bound 5PAA which was included in the model using coordinates obtained from the rabbit PGI­5PAA complex (PDB: 1G9819). The structure of the Mn2C-containing 5PAA complex in the C2 crystals was determined by molecular replacement using AMoRe27 and the coordinates of PDB:1PLZ4 as the search model and then refined with REFMAC5. The structure of the free-enzyme in the P212121 crystals was solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP28 and the coordinates of the of the PfPGI/5PAA metal-free complex (with the 5PAA moiety removed) and subsequently refined with REFMAC5. The resulting maps for the three datasets were examined in TURBO-FRODO.29 Analysis of the FOKFC map produced for the metal-containing 5PAA complex showed a clear peak of 8s, which was assigned to manganese. The structures were rebuilt and subsequently refined using restrained refinement. Rounds of ARP/wARP30 were used to identify the water structure in the two 5PAA complexes. Refinement statistics for the three structures are presented in Table 1. The quality of the models was assessed with PROCHECK,31 which revealed that there are no non-glycine Ramachandran outliers with 95.6%, 93.7% and 88.0% of the residues in favoured conformations for the structures of the metalfree and Mn2C-containing 5PAA complexes and of the free-enzyme, respectively. All residues are present in the final models of each structure expect for residues 160A­ 161A, 188A­198A, 160B and 189B in the free enzyme and 189A in the Mn2C containing 5PAA complex, which lie in poorly defined density. Images have been produced using PyMol,32 Molscript,33 BOBSCRIPT and Raster3d.34 To assay enzyme activity in the presence and absence of metal, discontinuous coupled assays were conducted in the direction F6P to G6P using PfPGI at approximately 1 mg/ml. Samples (5 ml) of PfPGI, pre-treated as described in Table 2, were diluted tenfold in 100 mM Mops (pH 7) and warmed for two minutes at 50 8C. A volume of 10 ml of 500 mM F6P in 100 mM Mops (pH 7) was added and the reaction mix was incubated at 50 8C for five minutes and then placed on ice to stop the reaction. A 10 ml aliquot of the reaction mixture was then added to a solution containing 20 ml of 200 mM NADPC in 100 mM Mops (pH 7), 0.7 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Roche diagnostics) and 960 ml of 100 mM Mops (pH 7). Total G6P production by PfPGI was determined by measuring maximum absorbance at 340 nm after 15 minutes incubation using a WPA lightwave S2000 UV/visible spectrophotometer.

1QWR, unpublished data) with PfPGI reveals an overall structural similarity between the two enzymes and the conservation of residues around the metal-binding sites. This includes two histidine residues (His90 and His136 in PfPGI and His96 and His173 in PMI) and the glutamate that might act as the catalytic base in PfPGI, Glu97 (Glu116 in PMI). Recent biochemical studies on PMI examining inhibition by 5PAA and 5PAH23 have led to the suggestion that the mechanism of PMI utilises a cisenediol intermediate with the metal ion stabilising the developing negative charge on the intermediate,23 perhaps suggesting that the mechanism of PfPGI may be similar. However, as yet, there are no crystal structures of PMI with inhibitor (Figure 6) or substrate, which would enable their more detailed comparison to be made. Currently, the mechanism of PfPGI is not completely understood and further studies are clearly required. Previous structural studies have been used to suggest that a cis-enediol mechanism for PfPGI is unlikely.5 However, the comparisons reported here clearly show considerable similarity in the relative disposition of the inhibitor 5PAA and a possible base catalyst, Glu97, to that seen in the eukaryotic PGIs. Furthermore there is also significant structural similarity between PfPGI and PMI for which a cis-enediol mechanism has been proposed. In the light of this we suggest that in PfPGI a cis-enediol mechanism, utilising the bound metal ion for charge stabilisation, is compatible with the available structural data and should not be ruled out.

Materials and Methods
The gene encoding PfPGI was cloned, over-expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described.17 The cloning strategy resulted in the introduction of an additional methionine residue at the N terminus in the recombinant enzyme. Samples of PfPGI were concentrated to 14 mg/ ml and crystallised in 1.6 M tri-sodium citrate (pH 6.5) (free-enzyme, space group P212121), with the addition of 50 mM 5PAA (PfPGI/5PAA metal-free complex, space group C2) or with 100 mM MnCl2 and 50 mM 5PAA (PfPGI/5PAA Mn2C-containing complex, space group C2). Data were collected on the PfPGI/5PAA metal-free ° complex crystal to 1.5 A resolution using BM14 at the ERSF on a single crystal of seleno-methionine incorporated enzyme flash cooled to 100 K, with a Mar Research
