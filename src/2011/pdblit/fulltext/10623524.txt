The high-affinity inhibition of stromelysin 1 (MMP-3) by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1) helps control tissue remodeling and tumor development. The interaction of N-TIMP-1 with the catalytic domain of MMP-3 has been investigated by titration calorimetry and 15 N NMR. Their unfavorable enthalpy of binding of þ 6.5 kcal mol21 is unusual among protein ­protein associations, deviates from structurebased prediction, and is compensated by a net entropy increase providing at least 18 kcal mol21 of favorable free energy of binding at a 1 M reference state. The small heat capacity of binding agrees well with the heat capacity predicted from 65% of the surface buried on binding being polar, and suggests that the hydrophobic effect can account for only part of the entropy of binding. Using NMR, binding-induced changes in the backbone of N-TIMP-1 were checked as one possible source of conformational entropy changes. MMP binding slightly increases rigidity in some contact sites in TIMP-1 but increases mobility remotely in the otherwise rigid b-barrel core of N-TIMP-1, increasing 15N relaxation evidence of pico- to nanosecond and micro- to millisecond fluctuations of b-strands A ­ F. Residual dipolar couplings suggest dynamic deviations from X-ray coordinates of the complex. These suggest that the b-barrel has small backbone conformational fluctuations, while segments of strands bB, bE and bF might experience fluctuations only in their backbone environment. This is a distinctive example of affinity between two well-structured proteins being enhanced by increased conformational entropy in the reservoir of a folding core.

Interfacial contacts are thought to govern the specificity and affinity of macromolecular interactions. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) inhibit the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) with nanomolar affinity, providing a wellcharacterized class of protein­ protein interactions for biophysical characterization of the determinants of high-affinity recognition. MMPs are zinc endopeptidases that hydrolyze components of the extracellular matrix in development, blastocyst implantation, ovulation, and wound healing. Enhanced MMP activity is linked to elevated matrix destruction in cancer, arthritis, and arterial disease. Active MMPs are regulated by 1:1 (M) binding by TIMPs-1, -2, -3, or -4.1 Over-expression of MMP-3 stimulates development of malignant

Flexibility of TIMP-1 b-Barrel Increased by Endothermic Binding of MMP

Figure 1. Association of N-TIMP-1 with MMP-3(DC) is endothermic with small, negative heat capacity change, using ITC in Pipes (pH 6.8): (a) 167 mM MMP-3(DC) was used in 16 injections of 8 ml into a 1.43 ml cell containing 17 mM N-TIMP-1 at 298 K. Addition of MMP3(DC) into buffer alone is shown as the bottom trace, showing small exothermic heats of dilution and mixing that were subtracted. Squares and scales at bottom and right describe the integrated heats. (b) DHobs as a function of temperature is shown with a least-squares fit. DCp from the slope is 2 50.4(^ 6.2) cal K21 mol21.

mammary tumors, an effect blocked by co-expression of TIMP-1.2 The presence of TIMPs correlates inversely with oncogenicity.3 To understand fully the affinity of TIMPs for MMPs, thermodynamic and dynamic studies are required to complement structural data. This will aid engineering of selective forms of N-TIMP-1 for possible therapeutic applications.4 N-TIMP-1 comprises the N-terminal two-thirds of human TIMP-1 and is sufficient to inhibit MMPs-1, -2 and -3 with KI values of 1 ­2 nM.5 Structures of MMP-3(DC) bound to TIMP-16 and of the free forms of MMP3(DC)7 and N-TIMP-18 enable structure-based prediction of thermodynamics of association of MMP-3(DC) and N-TIMP-1. Structures are available for TIMP-2, both free9,10 and bound to MMP14(DC).11 Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measures heat transfer during molecular interactions, providing the stoichiometry (N) and enthalpy of binding (DH).12 The temperaturedependence of DH provides the heat capacity, DCp,

of association that can be correlated with solvation entropy of binding and with structural estimates of non-polar and polar surface area buried upon binding.13 Recognition sites usually become more rigid on binding. For example, the fast internal motions of the large, exposed AB loop of TIMP-2 are reduced on binding to MMP-3(DC), by inspection of 15N T2 values and 15N{1H} nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs).14 (Human N-TIMP-1 and -2 are 46% identical in sequence, but notably differ in that the AB loop of TIMP-2 is much longer and more solvent-exposed.) The S10 to S30 subsites on the "right side" of MMP active sites are less mobile when an inhibitor binds them.15,16 Compensating redistribution of protein configurational entropy was found in some cases of ligand binding.17 ­ 19 Conformational entropy gain favoring the binding of proteins to DNA, peptide or small ligands has been observed.20 ­ 23 In such NMR studies, conformational entropy changes are deduced from comparisons of Lipari ­ Szabo order parameters, SLZ, that report on internal reorientation of bonds occurring in pico- to nanoseconds,24 measured in free and bound states. Configurational entropy can be related to SLZ.25 ­ 27 SLZ2 comes from "modelfree" fits of NMR relaxation such as transverse relaxation (R2), longitudinal relaxation (R1), and 15 N{1H} NOE from backbone 15N relaxation.28 Fluctuations on the scale of micro- to milliseconds are suggested by the Rex line-broadening parameter. Sites of motions over a broad range of timescales can now be identified by fitting residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) to X-ray coordinates using Saupe order matrix analysis.29,30 Before protein structure was understood, Steinberg & Scheraga hypothesized that protein ­ protein associations partly compensate the loss of translational and rotational entropy on binding by introducing favorable internal entropy as vibrations.31 Here, we demonstrate by NMR such a phenomenon in N-TIMP-1 as it binds MMP3(DC). We show that this association overcomes an enthalpic cost, only partly by a relatively small hydrophobic effect. MMP-3(DC) binding increases pico- to nanosecond and micro- to millisecond fluctuations in the otherwise rigid backbone of the b-barrel of N-TIMP-1, a probable source of remote conformational entropy gain that enhances affinity.

Results
Binding of N-TIMP-1 to MMP-3(DC) is endothermic with modest hydrophobic effect Calorimetric titrations of N-TIMP-1 by MMP3(DC) at 298 K display heat uptake with each injection until N-TIMP-1 is saturated with MMP-3(DC), indicating that the binding is enthalpically disfavored with an apparent enthalpy DHobs of 6.84(^ 0.07) kcal mol21 (1 cal ¼ 4.184 J) at pH 6.8 (Figure 1(a)).

areas of the endothermic peaks (Figure 1(a)) and preliminary kinetics from surface plasmon resonance both suggest a slow on-rate at 298 K. To account for any accompanying heats of protonation, DHobs was measured at 298 K at pH 6.8 in buffers with different heats of ionization, since: DHobs ¼ DH8int þ NHþ DHion where DH8int is independent of choice of buffer, DHion is the ionization enthalpy of the buffer, and NHþ is the number of protons taken up or released to the buffer. The insignificant dependence of DHobs on DHion for this association at pH 6.8 (Table 1) indicates virtually no proton uptake; NHþ ¼ 0.06 ^ 0.07 is found from a fit of the DHobs versus DHion values of Table 1. Because the affinity is too high to be determined by ITC, the binding affinity was obtained from KI values from enzyme inhibition experiments. From the KI of 2.8(^ 0.3) nM and DH8int of 6.5 kcal mol21 (at either 20 mM or 200 mM) at pH 6.8 and 298 K, DGI;1 M equals 2 11.7(^ 0.3) kcal mol21 and 2TDSI;1 M equals 2 18.2(^ 0.4) kcal mol21, for the standard reference state of 1 M. Ignoring the biochemical convention of a 1 M reference in favor of a more directly relevant concentration scales up DGI and 2TDSI by 2RT lnðC8Þ; where C8 is the chosen reference concentration in units of molarity.32,33 A physiologically relevant reference of 1 mM shift to represents an 8.2 kcal mol21 and 2TDSI;1 mM ¼ DGI;1 mM ¼ 23:5 kcal mol21 210:0 kcal mol21. A reference of 100 mM, relevant to ITC and NMR experiments of this study, represents a 5.5 kcal mol21 shift to DGI;100 mM ¼ 26:2 kcal mol21 and 2TDSI;100 mM ¼ 212:7 kcal mol21. The fraction of N-TIMP-1 competent to bind or inhibit MMP-3(DC) was found to be 0.38 ­ 0.44, i.e. the apparent value of N throughout all ITC experiments (Figure 1(a)) and MMP inhibition assays. Yet N-TIMP-1 and MMP-3(DC) bind 1:1 (M). All thermodynamic and binding parameters quoted here, related to ITC and inhibition, have been properly corrected to account for the 40% of recombinant N-TIMP-1 that is competent to bind. That is, the binding parameters are quoted per equivalent of active N-TIMP-1. MS-MS studies show that the inactivation of N-TIMP-1 results from acetylation of its a-amino group during expression in Escherichia coli (G.G. et al., unpublished results). DCp of binding was obtained from the temperature-dependence of DHobs at pH 6.8 in Pipes. DHobs

decreases linearly with temperature, yielding DCp ¼ 250:4ð^6:2Þ cal K21 mol21 (Figure 1(b)). The entropy of solvation can be estimated using p p DSsolv ¼ DCp lnðT=Ts Þ; where Ts is the reference of 385 K.13,34 This gives a value for DSsolv of about 12.9 cal mol21 K21, i.e. 12.9 e.u. At 298 K, 2TDSsolv is estimated to be 2 3.8 kcal mol21. Assuming 2TDSsolv is not underestimated by more than twofold, it appears that the release of ordered water upon association of MMP-3(DC) with N-TIMP-1 does not account for most of the entropy gain driving their association. Backbone dynamics of N-TIMP-1 bound to MMP-3(DC) Whether changes in configurational entropy in the N-TIMP-1 backbone could contribute to the large entropy gain driving its interaction with MMP-3(DC) was investigated by comparing the backbone dynamics of N-TIMP-1 bound to MMP3(DC) E202Q with those of free N-TIMP-1.35 After excluding several backbone amide NMR peaks from relaxation analysis because of overlap or weak peak heights, 15N R1 and R2 relaxation rates and 15N{1H} NOE were obtained for 86 residues of bound N-TIMP-1 at 307 K at 600 MHz (Figure 2). Excluding residues enriched in pico- to nanosecond motions (residues 25, 49­ 58, and 124 ­126), the average 15N{1H} NOE is 0.73 ^ 0.07, the average R1 is 1.22(^ 0.13) s21 and the average R2 is 21.7(^ 1.7) s21. The relaxation data were fit using the model-free formalism.24 Initially, the choice among five spectral density expressions used an F-test approach that favors selection of simpler expressions.36 Overall, the resulting S 2 order parameters for both the free state of N-TIMP-135 and its MMP-3(DC)-bound state were higher than reported for most proteins, with a majority of analyzed residues in both states appearing to have S 2 of $ 0.97. The following potential sources of inflation of S 2 were considered and deemed quite unlikely to cause the high S 2 values in N-TIMP-1. Self-association of the free state was dismissed on the basis of sedimentation equilibrium evidence of its monomeric state and lack of concentration effects on R2.35 15N R2/R1 ratios of N-TIMP-1 bound to MMP-3(DC), a 34 kDa complex of 299 residues, imply a rotational correlation time tm of, at most, 13.6 ns at 307 K, suggesting self-association to be unlikely. S 2 values were scarcely affected by choice of diffusion model, ranging from isotropic to axially symmetric with Dk =D' ratios up to 1.30. The high S 2 values prevailed ° while using the amide bond length of 1.02 A that avoids inflation of S 2. The high S 2 values may result, in large part, from systematic under-fitting promoted by the F-test approach. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) is a well-established protocol in statistics for determining parameters needed in data fitting.37 Use of AIC was recently shown to provide most representative model selection, to minimize

under-fitting, to better fulfill parsimony and to introduce less bias.38 AIC selection was used to refit the 500 MHz R1, R2 and NOE plus 750 MHz R1 of free N-TIMP-1. AIC selected 25 residues needing only S 2, 46 residues needing S 2 and te ; seven residues needing S 2 and Rex, 12 residues needing S 2, te, and Rex, and 12 residues needing S2, S2 and te. ModelFree 4.0 then found tm of f S 10.76 ns with Dk/D' of 1.09 to be optimal for the free state at 293 K. Model selection using AIC reduced by 1.9-fold the number of residues to 33 in the free state with S2 $ 0:96: The resiliently high S 2 values depend most upon the 15N{1H} NOE, which was measured quite carefully at two fields with long recovery delays: (i) to ensure full amplitude by complete 15N recovery in the saturated spectra; and (ii) to avoid inflation by avoiding saturation transfer in the reference spectra. N-TIMP-1 appears to have an unusually rigid backbone in the free state. For MMP-3(DC)-bound N-TIMP-1, AIC selected 21 residues needing S 2 and te, 21 residues needing S 2 and Rex, 43 residues needing S 2, te and Rex and one residue needing S2, S2 and te. Thus, chemical f S exchange broadening appears much more widespread in the bound state. Excluding residues whose amide peaks AIC suggests to be exchange broadened (see Figure 4(a) and (b)), the R2/R1 ratio of the remaining residues suggests tm to be near 12.45 ns for the MMP-3(DC)-bound state at 307 K, consistent with an apparent lack of selfassociation. This rotational correlation time is a

little shorter than expected, possibly because of reorientation of N-TIMP-1 relative to MMP-3(DC) with amplitude of perhaps ^ 58 or more, as suggested by RDC-based docking of their structures (S.A. & S.R.V.D., unpublished results). With tm fixed at 12.45 ns for N-TIMP-1 in the complex, axial symmetry of the diffusion tensor with Dk/ D' of 1.25 fit the relaxation data best, in reasonable agreement with the hydrodynamic prediction of a ratio of 1.33, using X-ray coordinates 1UEA. Model selection using AIC reduced by 2.2-fold the number of residues to 23 in the MMP-bound state with S2 $ 0:96: Sites of binding-dependent configurational entropy change Figure 3(a) shows S 2 in free35 and MMP-3(DC)bound states of N-TIMP-1 (deposited at the BMRB with codes 5154 and 5153, respectively). S 2 differs by less than 0.05 (a typical uncertainty in the difference) for most backbone amide groups analyzed (see Figure 2 of the Supplementary Material). A few residues in the MMP-binding ridge of N-TIMP-1 become more rigid on binding MMP3(DC); namely, Cys3, Cys70 (linked to zinc-coordinating Cys1) in the AB loop and Thr98 below in the EF loop (Figure 3). Underneath the MMP-binding ridge, the segment from His95 of bE through Ala103 of bF appears to become subtly more rigid, according to the free energy interpretation of Figure 3(b) based on equation (1).

suggest the interfacial rigidification to be offset by the appearance that several residues throughout the b-barrel of N-TIMP-1 become more flexible once bound to MMP-3(DC), in terms of backbone amide bond reorientations on the pico- to nanosecond scale. The sites undergoing largest MMP-3binding-induced drops in S 2, i.e. increases in picoto nanosecond fluctuations, include Leu17, Val18 and Arg20 of bA; Glu39 and Lys44 of bB; Phe49; Val61 of bC; Glu82, Phe83, Ile85, Gly87 and Gln90 of bD; Trp105, Thr119 and Thr121 (Figure 3; and see Figure 2 of the Supplementary Material). Of these, residues 17, 18, 20, 44, 49, 82, 83, 85, 87 and 105 cluster on one side of the b-barrel (at the right in Figure 3(c)). Figure 3(b) shows an estimate of changes in free energy of configurational entropy 2TDSconf;B-F of each backbone amide group of N-TIMP-1 upon binding. Downward changes should contribute favorably to the free energy of association. The estimate of DSconf;B-F based on the change in internal rotational bond vector fluctuations indicated by SLZ in free and bound states (Figure 3(a) and (b)) uses equation (1).27 Summing the 2TDSconf;B-F values of all amide groups (Figure 3(b)) suggests that they might provide an entropy increase of up to 2 10.2 kcal mol21 of binding free energy at 300 K. This is likely to be an overestimate of the configurational entropy change due to pico- to nanosecond backbone amide fluctuations. Summing 2TDSconf;B-F estimates from each residue assumes independence of motion of the individual amide groups, which is unlikely to be valid, since some backbone motions are likely to be correlated, given their structural proximity. Equation (1) is reliable only for S2 & 0:95; Sconf is overestimated LZ by the classical expression where S2 * 0:95:27 LZ This affects 11 residues whose S2 values drop by LZ 0.05 or more (Figure 3), resulting in significant overestimation of DSconf for these sites and in the sum of 2 10.2 kcal mol21. Furthermore, there is substantial uncertainty in S 2 related to measurement and fitting, plus some statistical uncertainty in relating S2 to Sconf.27 LZ MMP-3(DC)-binding-induced slower fluctuations in N-TIMP-1 backbone Configurational entropy changes on longer timescales can be investigated qualitatively since fluctuations in micro- to milliseconds can manifest themselves as line broadening. Elevated R2/R1 relaxation rates can be sufficient to recognize exchange broadening, without need for model-free fitting or coordinates. Discrimination of exchange broadening from effects of bond orientation on R2/R1 when rotational diffusion is anisotropic can be recognized by plotting R2/R1 against 1DNH.39 To evaluate the applicability of this plot to the MMP3(DC)/N-TIMP-1 complex, the tensors of rotational diffusion and of PEG/hexanol-induced alignment were calculated and visualized with TENSOR40 and MODULE,41 respectively. The principal axes

Figure 4. MMP-3(DC) binding appears to increase N-TIMP-1 backbone mobility on slower time-scales. (a) Rex from model-free fitting marks sites of micro- to millisecond fluctuations of the N-TIMP-1 backbone in the complex. Red squares mark residues with Rex only in the complex, while black triangles mark residues with Rex in both free and bound states. (b) Residues with chemical exchange on the micro- to millisecond scale have elevated R2/R1 15N relaxation ratios (numbered, red circles), confirming use of Rex for them in model-free fitting. The line is fit to residues with minimal exchange (Rex , 4 Hz) and lacking disorder (black squares). Bond orientation effects on R2/R1 are accounted for by 1DNH RDCs and the slope of the fit.39 (c) Order matrix analysis of successive quintets of residues29 used X-ray coordinates 1UEA. Deviations of SZZ, approximating the generalized degree of order, mark sites of dynamic or structural perturbations from the coordinates.30 The circles mark the optimum SVD fit, while open squares and triangles indicate confidence limits due to uncertainty in X-ray coordinates and 1DNH RDCs. The uncertainties are ° ^ 1 Hz in 1DNH RDCs and ^ 0.23 A (,1 s) in HN positions estimated from the X-ray coordinates, equivalent to uncertainty in H­ N bond orientation of ^138. The central dotted line represents the average optimal SZZ/2 value. Broken lines mark the averages of the low and high extremes of SZZ/2 solutions possible given the uncertainties. Quintets whose entire simulated range of SZZ/2 values fall outside the average range of SZZ/2 are numbered in bold. SZZ, describing the principal alignment axis, is on a scale of maximal 1DNH of 50 Hz where the overall degree of alignment < 0.001. (d) Several of the mobile residues manifest deviations of individual 1DNH RDCs from those predicted by SVD fitting of all RDCs to X-ray coordinates 1UEA using PALES.74 The x2 deviation between measured and predicted 1DNH is normalized by the breadth of the distribution of RDCs, namely Da ¼ 25 Hz.

of diffusion and of alignment agree to within 258 or 308 along the long axis of the complex, justifying the relevance of Figure 4(b). (The orientation of the principal axis of the diffusion tensor has an uncertainty of at least 258 in semi-angle, while the orientation of the alignment tensor is well defined.) The model-free evidence that many N-TIMP-1 residues in the complex experience micro- to milliseconds exchange broadening (Figure 4(a)) is corroborated by their presence in the upper swath of the R2/R1 versus 1DNH scatter plot of Figure 4(b). In both free35 and bound states of N-TIMP-1, Rex is

present in the MMP-binding ridge at Val29 and Asn30 of the AB loop; Tyr35, Gln36 and Tyr38 of b-strand B; Cys70, Phe73 and His74 of the CD loop; as well as at Ile96, Thr97, Cys99 and Ser100 of the EF loop (black triangles in Figure 4(a), green in Figure 5(a)). Thr2 and Cys3 also exhibit Rex in the bound state (Figures 4(a) and 5(a)). Small peak heights for Gln31-Leu34 of the AB loop plus Arg75 preclude fitting to obtain Rex but could result from exchange broadening continuing in the complex (light green in Figure 5(a)). Thus, chemical exchange of the MMP-binding ridge of

Figure 5. MMP-3(DC) binding may introduce slower fluctuations encompassing the N-TIMP-1 b-barrel, far from the interface. Helices, b-strands, and affected residues are labeled in the two stereo pairs. (a) The N-TIMP-1 backbone is colored by Rex from Figure 4(a). Residues with Rex in both bound and free states are green. Residues with Rex . 4 Hz only in the complex are red. Residues with Rex , 4 Hz only in the complex are orange. Residues in the complex having broad lines and 15N relaxation too fast to fit are in a lighter shade, since their broadening may arise from micro- to millisecond fluctuations. (b) The N-TIMP-1 backbone is colored red for the quintets with deviating SZZ values (Figure 4(c)).

N-TIMP-1 persists in the complex. Some of this may include micro- to millisecond scale structural fluctuations of the ridge itself, judging from deviations of individual RDCs or quintets of RDCs for residues 30, 34, 63, 70 and 71 (see below, Figures 4(c) and (d), and 5(b)). Most strikingly, the binding of MMP-3(DC) E202Q introduces chemical exchange broadening to many residues throughout the b-barrel of N-TIMP-1 and elsewhere far from the interface. Residues experiencing micro- to millisecond fluctuations apparently only in the complex are found in every strand of the b-barrel: Leu17-Ile19, Ala21-Val24 and Glu28 of bA; Gln36Met45 of bB; Gly 48 and Arg59 of the BC loop; Val61-Thr63 of bC; Ser80 of the CD loop; Glu82, Ile85-Lys88 and Gln90 of bD; Asp91 and Gly92 of the DE turn; His95 of bE; and Phe101-Ala103 of bF (Figures 4(a) and 5(a)). Exchange broadening in the complex appears outside the b-barrel to a lesser extent only at Thr10-Cys13 of helix 1; Trp105Leu108 of the F-a2 loop, Ser109, Leu110 and Thr117 of helix 2; and Val122. The amide peaks of

neighboring residues Tyr46, Lys47, Phe60, and Leu93 are weak only in the complex (too weak for relaxation fitting), suggesting the likelihood of chemical exchange in them as well (pink in Figure 5(a)). SVD fitting of RDCs to local segments of highresolution structures can reveal sites of deviations from the coordinates that are either static or dynamic with rates of several Hz or faster.29,30 Elements of the diagonalized Saupe order matrix, or alignment tensor, describe the degree and direction of alignment of the protein fragment relative to the magnetic field. SZZ describes the degree of order along the principle axis of alignment of the aligned sample. Furthermore, SZZ is the alignment tensor parameter that is least sensitive to measurement and structural uncertainty (J. H. Prestegard, personal communication). The axial order element SZZ approximates the generalized degree of order in the limit that alignment is axially symmetric (R ¼ 0).30 The weakly oriented N-TIMP-1/MMP3(DC) complex approaches this limit in part, since

R ¼ 0:2: Several quintets of residues and 1DNH RDCs markedly deviate in SZZ/2 from the average range for most of the N-TIMP-1 backbone in the complex (Figure 4(c)), deviations significant in light of the uncertainties in structure and 1DNH. A few SZZ deviations correlate with their nanosecond fluctuations of considerable amplitude (residues 49 ­52 and 122 ­126; Figures 3(a), 4(c), and 5(b)), though residues 53­ 58 having nanosecond mobility lack deviant SZZ. Most quintets with deviations of SZZ/2 manifest micro- to millisecond exchange broadening, very suggestive of slow dynamic deviation from the crystal structure of the complex. Such segments include TIMP-1 residues 15 ­ 21 of bA, 42 ­ 48 of bB, 61 ­ 63 of bC, 70­ 71 of the CD loop, and 85 ­ 94 of bD-bE (Figures 4(c) and 5(b)). These segments of bA, bB, and bD form a contiguous section of the b-barrel (Figure 5). Most of the residues of this swath have decreased S 2 values in the complex (Figure 3). The bC segment clusters with the adjacent sites in the CD loop and bE. The SZZ/2 values of quintets encompassing exchanging residues 29 ­ 34 of the AB loop, 35­ 40 of bB, 95 ­ 107 through bE and bF fail to deviate (Figure 4(c)), suggesting that their exchange behavior might result from fluctuation of their environment. Environmental fluctuations around these positions in the b-barrel might result from the slow conformational fluctuations of b-strands C and D that adjoin and hydrogen bond each of these segments (Figure 5).

Discussion
Comparison of thermodynamics measured and predicted from structure The net burial of apolar and polar surface area in a protein ­protein association can be used to predict DH of binding using equations (2) and (3) and DCp of binding using equation (4). To determine changes in surface area accurately, conformational changes must be considered. Omitting the C-terminal domain of TIMP-1 from the coordinates of the MMP-3(DC)-TIMP-1 complex (PDB code 1UEA),6 ° the interfacial area is 2000 A2. However, TIMP-1 binding displaces the N terminus of MMP-3(DC) from its usual location along helix C,6,42 and shifts loop residues Pro221-Arg231 on the rim of the MMP-3 active site. MMP-3(DC) binding causes adjustment in the MMP-binding ridge of TIMP-1; its AB and CD loops bend back from the MMP.8 Comparison of the free states of MMP-3(DC) (PDB code 1CQR)7 and N-TIMP-1 (code 1D2B)8 with the complex yields a much lower net surface area ° ° burial of 1400 A2. Of this, 490 A2 (35%) is hydro° 2 (65%) is polar. The surface area phobic and 910 A burial predicted using equation (4) and the DCp of 2 50.4 cal mol21 K21 agrees very well with these structural measurements. The empirical relationships of DCp to DASAnpol and DASApol in equation (4) using the parameters from Baker & Murphy13

° ° and Spolar et al.43 predict 560 A2 (40%) and 530 A2 ° (38%), respectively, of the 1400 A2 of surface area buried when MMP-3(DC) binds N-TIMP-1 to be hydrophobic. The more recent para° meterizations44,45 estimate 476 A2 (34%) of the buried surface area to be hydrophobic, in closer agreement with the structural analysis. The use of equation (4) for the association of MMP-3(DC) and N-TIMP-1 provides structurebased predictions of DCp of þ 23 cal mol21 K21, 2 29.5 cal mol21 K21, 2 59 cal mol21 K21, and 2 55 cal mol21 K21, with each of the four sets of coefficients. The more recent parameterizations agree especially well with the measured DCp of 2 50.4 cal mol21 K21. In contrast to the strong relationship of DCp to surface burial in this case, the enthalpy of association was poorly predicted from surface burial. ° Interpretation of the 1400 A2 of surface burial, 65% polar, using equations (2) and (3) predicts a favorable DH of association of 2 24.7 kcal mol21 at 25 8C, at odds with the measured DHint of þ 6.5 kcal mol21 for the N-TIMP-1 association with MMP-3(DC) at pH 6.8. Three issues may relate to the measured enthalpy of binding being 31 kcal mol21 more unfavorable than the prediction. First, the enthalpy of polar surface burial has been controversial. Uncertainty in the enthalpy of polar surface burial is certainly relevant to the N-TIMP-1/MMP-3(DC) interaction given that 65% of the buried surface area is polar. Equation (2) used in the prediction is based on hydrogen bonds formed at buried polar surfaces being quite enthalpically stabilizing.13 The opposing perspective is that desolvation of polar and backbone groups in protein­ protein interfaces is enthalpically unfavorable.46 The second consideration is that the enthalpy of chelation of the zinc in the MMP active site by the a-amino and carbonyl groups of Cys1 of TIMPs is unknown. Thirdly, better-known enthalpy costs of association should be considered. There is a small enthalpy cost of loss of translational and rotational degrees of freedom upon protein ­protein association, DHtrans;rot of 4:5 ^ 1:5RT; independent of concentration.33 This represents 2:7 ^ 0:9 kcal mol21 at 298 K contributing to the DHint of þ 6.5 kcal mol21 for the association at pH 6.8. Probably somewhat larger is the enthalpic cost of reorganizing the MMP-binding ridge of N-TIMP-1 and the N terminus of MMP-3 on binding may contribute to the discrepancy. Enthalpic costs of conformational change are known to disrupt relationships between free energy and surface burial.47 Thermal activation barriers for the micro- to millisecond fluctuations of the AB loop residues of TIMP-1 that change conformation on MMP-3 binding were estimated to be about 8 ­ 13 kcal mol21.35 Enthalpic costs of the structural adjustment of the MMP-binding ridge of N-TIMP-1 would account for the broadening of the ITC endotherms at lower temperatures that suggest slowing on-rates with decreasing temperature.

Sites of DSconf that may enhance affinity of N-TIMP-1 for MMP-3(DC) Most of the backbone of free N-TIMP-1 is unusually rigid (Figure 3(a)),35 limiting entropic costs of MMP binding to a few residues in the MMP-binding ridge having a significant increase in S 2 in the complex such as Cys3, Cys70 and Thr98 (Figure 3; and see Figure 2 of the Supplementary Material). Further from the interface, Ala11, Tyr38, Ile58, Ser80, Val102, Leu108 and Leu110 also seem to become more rigid. The persistence of chemical exchange throughout the ridge of N-TIMP-1 in free and bound states suggests binding of the MMP does not quench all micro- to millisecond fluctuations in the ridge. The exchange broadening of the MMP-binding ridge in the bound state cannot be due to binding and unbinding because the on-rate48 of 1 £ 106 M21 s21 implies an off-rate of 3 £ 1023 s21, i.e. unbinding in minutes. MMP-induced decreases in S 2 across N-TIMP-1 b-strands A, B, C, D, and F (Figure 3) lead to estimated -TDSconf;B-F of 2 10.2 kcal mol21. This estimate of conformational entropy gain is limited by systematic and measurement errors listed in Results, and by lack of data for some residues, by ignoring backbone carbon atoms, and by lack of quantification of the entropy of the slower fluctuations evident from Rex and SZZ deviations. MMP-binding-induced mobility around remote sites in the TIMP-1 b-barrel appear to amply offset the slight rigidification of the MMP-binding ridge. The estimated solvation entropy of 2 3.8 kcal mol21 and qualitative overestimate of 2TDSconf of 2 10 kcal mol21 for fast fluctuations of the N-TIMP-1 are accommodated by the 2 10 kcal mol21 to 2 13 kcal mol21 favorable total entropy change driving N-TIMP-1 association with MMP-3(DC) at physiological to experimental concentrations. The widespread increase in slower fluctuations in the N-TIMP-1 backbone due to MMP-3(DC) binding must be an additional source of increased configurational entropy in N-TIMP-1 that favors binding. Considering the high level of rigidity of the b-barrel residues in free N-TIMP-1 suggested by high S 2 and lack of Rex,35 they clearly undergo a gain in DSconf;B-F ; judging from MMP-bindinginduced Rex, quintet SZZ deviations, and x2 D1DNH deviations (Figures 4 and 5). The RDCs and SZZ should be sensitive to dynamic averaging over periods as long as 10­ 100 ms. These measurements do not estimate the DSconf;B-F of the slower fluctuations of the b-barrel that appear to enhance the affinity of N-TIMP-1 for MMP-3. It is striking that the residues with micro- to millisecond fluctuations induced by MMP binding encompass the folding core of the b-barrel; they are the same residues or sequential neighbors most protected from hydrogen exchange in the rigid core of free N-TIMP-1; namely, Leu17, Ile19-Ala21, Tyr38, Ile40, Val61, Phe83-Gly87, Ile96, and Ala103.8 Since the b-barrel in free and bound states differs in

° backbone RMSD by only 0.7 A,8 its slower backbone fluctuations in the complex must be of small amplitude. Since the melting transitions of both N-TIMP-1 and MMP-3(DC) are increased by around 14 8C and are steeper in the complex, it is unlikely that the b-barrel core of N-TIMP-1 is destabilized in the complex. The MMP-bindinglinked motions of N-TIMP-1 remote from the binding interface are likely to be correlated, since their sites are contiguous through the b-barrel. N-TIMP-1 residues with exchange broadening (Rex) and SZZ deviations introduced by MMP3(DC) binding form a large strip on the right side of the b-barrel that includes residues bA, bB, bD and bF (Figure 5). On the opposite side of the b-barrel, residues 59 ­63 of bC also manifest Rex and SZZ deviations in the bound state and adjoin segments with exchange broadening also in the free state (Figure 5(a)). The packing of this core region could result in their moving collectively in a slow or infrequent fashion that is detectable by micro- to millisecond exchange broadening and deviations of bond vectors, monitored by RDCs, from the static orientations of the crystal structure (Figures 4 and 5). Assay of changes in methyl dynamics of this region would provide further insights. Paths that might convey mobility increase into the core of the b-barrel of TIMP-1 were investigated by comparing its amide chemical shifts between free and MMP-3-bound states (Figure 6). Many of the TIMP-1 amide peaks whose positions are most perturbed by MMP-3 binding are found in the interface in the MMP-binding ridge in the N terminus, AB loop and CD loop, or right under the ridge in the EF loop. Sizable chemical shift changes are found outside the interface in helix 1, as well as in the BC loop most distant from the interface (Figure 6). A swath of residues from the N terminus, CD loop and EF loop suggest a path from the middle of the binding ridge into the wide end of the b-barrel of TIMP-1 (Figure 6(b)). This swath includes Cys3-Cys99 and Cys1-Cys70 disulfide links that might help distribute bindinginduced strain. Strain could be imagined to propagate through perturbed Tyr72, and fluctuations conceivably by flips of the Tyr72 ring, to neighboring and mildly perturbed Val102, Tyr38 and Thr63 of the top layer of side-chains in the b-barrel and to Ile96 of the middle layer of the barrel (Figure 6(b)). The perturbed AB loop that is mobile35 and that changes conformation upon MMP-3 binding8 could be another path of change to the b-barrel via Tyr62 with mildly perturbed chemical shift. Most distant from the interface is a cluster of residues with MMP-perturbed amide peak positions, particularly Met42 and Gly48, and also having MMP-increased exchange broadening and SZZ deviations. Backbone shift perturbations fail to suggest a path to this distal cluster. MMP-induced exchange broadening and SZZ deviations suggest one potential path from the MMP-binding ridge down b-strand C to the distal end of bB. Linkage

stability sites that transmit adjustments throughout N-TIMP-1. Probability of similar dynamics in other TIMPs The likelihood of similar MMP-dependent mobility changes in TIMP-2 is suggested by examination of 15N NMR relaxation results for N-TIMP-2, free and bound to MMP-3(DC),14 as well as crystal structures of free TIMP-2 and MT1-MMP(DC)bound TIMP-2.10,11 TIMP-2 differs from TIMP-1 in having a much longer and much more exposed AB loop rich in pico- to nanosecond motions in the free state that are mostly quenched upon MMP binding.14 Yet, some residual mobility appears to persist in the MMP-binding ridge of both N-TIMP-2 and N-TIMP-1 when MMP-3(DC) is bound. In the MMP-3(DC)-bound state of N-TIMP-2, Ser31-Asn33 of the AB hairpin hinge retain higher pico- to nanosecond mobility.14 The X-ray temperature factors for the backbone of TIMP-2 AB loop residues Asp34 and Ile35 are increased in the MT1-MMP-bound state of TIMP-2 (PDB code 1BQQ) relative to the free state of TIMP-2 (PDB code 1BR9) by factors of 1.39-fold and 1.34-fold. The mobility of the much shorter AB loop of N-TIMP-1 with MMP-3(DC) bound occurs instead on the micro- to millisecond scale (Figures 4(a) and (b), and 5(a)). The amide peaks of the CD loop residues of N-TIMP-2 and of N-TIMP-1 in intimate contact with MMP-3(DC) being broadened beyond detection suggests this loop retains micro- to millisecond fluctuations in the bound state (Figures 2 and 4).14 Neighboring CD loop residues Cys70 and Gly71 of N-TIMP-1 clearly seem to fluctuate slowly in the complex, judging from either exchange broadening or SZZ deviations (Figures 4(a) and (b), and 5(a) and (b)). The possibility of slight residual flexibility in the N-terminus of bound N-TIMP-1 in the heart of the interface is suggested by the model-free Rex term and lower-than-average S 2 of Thr2 and Cys3 (Figures 3(a), 4(a), and 5(a)) and by a modest deviation of the measured 1DNH of Val4 from that predicted from the X-ray structure (Figure 4(d)). MMP-binding appears to have increased the mobility of some of the residues of TIMP-2 remote from the interface in two of the segments that in N-TIMP-1 show most pronounced increase in backbone fluctuations due to MMP-3(DC) binding. MMP-3(DC) binding caused the 15N T2 values of Ile19-Thr21, Leu84, Ala86 of N-TIMP-2 to fall below the average T2, suggesting micro- to millisecond exchange broadening.14 These correspond to subsets of the segments from Leu17 to Ala21 of bA and from Ile85 to Asp91 around the DE loop of N-TIMP-1 that manifest micro- to millisecond conformational fluctuations, as well as pico- to nanosecond fluctuations, introduced by MMP-3(DC) binding (Figures 2­ 5). There is even some evidence of MMP-dependent increase in mobility in these segments from crystallography of TIMP-2. The X-ray temperature factors for the backbone of

to the distal cluster through interior side-chains of the b-barrel is possible but untested. Protein ­protein associations were proposed to redistribute the ensemble of structural states, with low stability interfacial regions helping to transmit the change to other regions of the protein.49 Consequently, the N-terminus of TIMP-1 and its AB and CD loops that undergo chemical exchange in free35 and bound states, and that change conformation on binding MMP-3(DC)8 might behave as such low-

TIMP-2 residues Ile19, Gly92, and Asp93 (equivalent to Ile19, Gln90, and Asp91 of TIMP-1) bound to MT1-MMP(DC)11 (PDB code 1BQQ) are increased over those in the crystalline state of free TIMP-2 (PDB code 1BR9)10 by factors of 1.39, 1.17, and 1.16, respectively. The suggestion that the line broadening of N-TIMP-2 residues Gln49-Lys51 is an artifact of the neighboring Ala21Thr mutation14 is unlikely, since the equivalent of Met42-Lys44 of bB of N-TIMP-1 undergo MMP-induced slow fluctuations (Figures 4 and 5). The model-free analysis and use of 1DNH RDCs used for N-TIMP-1 offer more discriminating insights than possible from the raw 15N T2 and 1H ­ 15N NOE data used to analyze free and bound N-TIMP-2. Perhaps because of this, a greater number of residues throughout N-TIMP-1, including the two most prominent segments, were observed to increase in internal motions as a result of MMP binding. MMP-binding induced conformational entropy increases remote from the binding interface could be a general characteristic of the binding of most TIMPs to MMPs.

General binding-linked entropy changes Consideration of the loss of the entropy of translational and rotational degrees of freedom, DStrans and DSrot, upon protein ­protein association is important47 but controversial.33 The penalty of association due to loss of DStrans rises as the solution becomes more dilute, accounting for the concentration-dependence of DG.33,50 The "cratic" approach to estimating DStrans and DSrot has been dismissed by thermodynamics and statistical thermodynamics theory.32,51,52 The cratic value of DSmix of 2 8 cal mol21 K21 was defended as consistent with experiment.53 Statistical mechanics using the Sackur ­ Tetrode equation from gasphase theory estimates DStrans þ DSrot of protein ­ protein association of 2 90 cal mol21 K21 to 2 100 cal mol21 K21 for the 1 M standard state,47,54 judged by others to be an upper limit.55 For both of two dimeric protein­ protein associations, direct measurements estimated DStrans þ DSrot at 2 10(^ 8) cal mol21 K21 for the 1 M state,32,33 casting doubts on the estimates from gas-phase, which are an order of magnitude larger than experiment. The empirical estimate represents a 2TðDStrans þ DSrot Þ free energy cost of association of þ 3(^ 2.4) kcal mol21at 298 K that enters into the total free energy from the entropy term of 2 18.2(^ 0.4) kcal mol21 at the 1 M reference. Taking this total as 2TDStot ¼ 2TðDSsolv þ where 2TDSsolv ¼ DStrans þ DSrot þ DSconf Þ; 23:8ð^2:3Þ kcal mol21, would suggest 2TDSconf ¼ 217:4ð^5:1Þ kcal mol21. Given the controversy in parsing entropy contributions, this uncertainty may be an underestimate. Even so, it appears that 2TDSconf appears to dominate in overcoming the cost of association of DHint 2 TðDStrans þ DSrot Þ of around þ 10 kcal mol21at 1 M (and greater at

lower concentration), so as to drive MMP-3(DC) ­ N-TIMP-1 binding. To better account for the entropy of insulin dimerization, it was hypothesized 40 years ago that loss of translational and rotational entropy on dimerization could be offset by gain of internal vibrations.31 A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for insulin dimerization monitored the conversion of three rotational and three translational degrees of freedom into six internal vibrational modes. The simulated, induced vibrational modes, on time-scales from less than a picosecond to the 10 ns scale of translation and rotation, were estimated to provide 7 kcal mol21 favorable offsetting free energy in accord with the hypothesis.54 Association-linked vibrational entropy gain twice this great was inferred from atomic movements deduced from X-ray structures.56 Experiment suggests loss of DStrans þ DSrot may be a much smaller33 impetus for binding-linked vibrations than the authors estimated.31,32,54,56 However, the significant enthalpic cost and relatively small 2TDSsolv of the MMP-3(DC) association with N-TIMP-1 binding seems to create a significant need for a very favorable conformational or vibrational entropy gain to attain their high affinity. The NMR data for N-TIMP-1 upon association with MMP-3(DC) represent relatively direct experimental evidence in support of Steinberg & Scheraga's hypothesis. The 15N NMR relaxation data and their S 2 order parameter (Figure 3) monitor a picosecond to 10 ns scale found to be important in the simulation of vibrational modes resulting from association.54 Furthermore, the NMR line broadening strongly suggests association-linked vibrational modes in the micro- to millisecond range (Figure 4(a) and (b)) not accessible to the simulation approach. These slow internal motions are also supported by the RDC deviations (Figure 4(c) and (d)). Binding-induced changes in dynamics within other proteins, distant from their binding sites, have been observed. Increases in configurational entropy at sites remote from recognition surfaces were observed in a protein binding a long peptide23 and in a protein binding ssDNA.20 In both cases, the remote entropy gains may offset the entropic cost of binding of the relatively unstructured partner.23 The propagation of configurational entropy gain to the remote b-barrel core of N-TIMP-1 upon MMP-3(DC) binding partly parallels these latter cases. N-TIMP-1 association with MMP-3(DC) is, however, distinctive in: (i) being driven by entropy gain, part of which is from binding-induced increases in remote core structural fluctuations; and in (ii) both partners being well-structured proteins, both free and bound. By contrast, other protein ­protein associations featuring well-structured partners, favorable enthalpy and unfavorable entropy changes46,57 were found by NMR to become more rigid far from the interface.19,58 This might suggest a general hypothesis that enthalpy-driven associations can

730

Flexibility of TIMP-1 b-Barrel Increased by Endothermic Binding of MMP

manifest increased rigidity at remote sites that is favorable in enthalpy, while associations driven by entropy not mostly due to the hydrophobic effect might manifest increased flexibility at remote sites. This latter source of favorable entropy change may compensate diverse costs of binding, including normal loss of DStrans and DSrot, normal loss of DSconf at the binding interface and case-specific enthalpic costs of structural rearrangement.

Homogeneous 1:1 complex was purified by gel-filtration with Superdex-75 (M) (Pharmacia). The buffer for NMR was 20 mM Tris-d11 (pH 6.22 at 34 8C), 125 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 1 mM NaN3, 50 mM ZnCl2, and 7% (v/v) 2 H2O.

Assignment of backbone NMR peaks of N-TIMP-1, bound to MMP-3(DC)
15 N/13C ­N-TIMP-1 (0.66 mM) bound to unlabeled MMP-3(DC) E202Q (34 kDa) was used to acquire HNCA, HNCO, and HN(CO)CA spectra64 at 307 K on the DRX-500 at UMC and Unity þ 720 at NHMFL. 15 N/13C/50%-2H-labeled N-TIMP-1 (0.52 mM) bound to unlabeled MMP-3(DC) E202Q was used to acquire a TROSY-HNCA65 on the DMX-750 at NMRFAM; this was effective at overcoming line-width limitations. The amide ­ amide region of an 15N NOESY-HSQC of 0.3 mM 98% 2H/15N N-TIMP-1 bound to unlabeled MMP-3(DC) E202Q, collected on the Inova 600 at UMC, resolved assignment ambiguities. In all, 91.7% of the 119 possible backbone NH, Ca, and C0 peaks of non-proline residues of N-TIMP-1 bound to unlabeled MMP-3 E202Q were assigned and deposited at BioMagResBank under code 5099. An annotated 15N HSQC is shown in Figure 1 of the Supplementary Material.

Materials and Methods
Human MMP-3(DC) and N-TIMP-1 were prepared as described.5,59 Their KI was determined as reported5 but with preincubation of the mixture at 298 K overnight in the Pipes buffer used for ITC. Fluorescence of the peptide substrate NFF-360 was measured with excitation at 335 nm and emission at 398 nm using an SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer. Protein concentrations, critical for estimating KI, enthalpy, and N values from titrations, were measured using BioRad assays (Hercules, CA) because the results lie within 2% of the determinations by amino acid analysis, for both N-TIMP-1 and MMP3(DC). Isothermal titration calorimetry Protein solutions were dialyzed thoroughly against 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 2 mM NaN3, 50 mM ZnCl2, 20 mM piperazine-1,4-bis-(2-ethanesulfonic acid)) (Pipes) (or N,N-bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (Bes) or N-(1-acetamido)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (Aces) or 3-Morpholinopropanesulfonic acid (Mops)), pH 6.8 and degassed prior to ITC. The high [NaCl] ensured solubility of N-TIMP-1 at 25 8C and higher. For experiments at different temperatures, pH was corrected to ensure constant pH. Titrations used a Microcal VP-ITC or a Calorimetry Sciences Corp. model 4200. N-TIMP-1 (10 ­20 mM) in the calorimetric cell was titrated with 100­ 200 mM MMP-3(DC) in the same buffer. Tenfold higher concentrations were required when using the CSC ITC. The heat uptake for the association of N-TIMP-1 and MMP-3(DC) was obtained from the difference between the integrated heat of reaction and the corresponding heat of dilution. Data were analyzed using the ITC version of Origin 5.0 with embedded calorimetric fitting routines. Preparation of stable 1:1 complex of N-TIMP-1 with MMP-3(DC) for NMR In 1:1 (M) mixtures of active N-TIMP-1 and MMP3(DC) at the high concentrations used for NMR, N-TIMP-1 is hydrolyzed slowly by the protease. The E202Q mutation in the MMP-3 active site decreases MMP activity several hundred-fold without affecting TIMP binding61,62 or the structure of MMP-3(DC).63 The E202Q mutation of MMP-3(DC) was constructed (Quickchange, Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. MMP-3(DC) E202Q was bound to N-TIMP-1 for NMR. A 1:1 (M) mixture of labeled active N-TIMP-1 and unlabeled MMP-3(DC) E202Q was prepared to avoid any excess of unbound N-TIMP-1. Since only 40 ­ 50% of N-TIMP-1 was capable of binding MMP-3(DC) E202Q, one equivalent of unlabeled MMP-3(DC) E202Q was incubated overnight with two equivalents of N-TIMP-1.

Perdeuteration of non-exchangeable groups of N-TIMP-1 in the complex enhanced sensitivity and resolution of 15N relaxation spectra by narrowing amide 1H lines. 15N R1 and R2 relaxation rates and 15N{1H} steadystate NOEs of 98% 2H/15N N-TIMP-1 bound to unlabeled MMP-3(DC) E202Q at 0.3 mM at 307 K were measured on the Inova 600 using standard sequences.66 Delay values were 50p, 150, 250p, 400p, 600, 800, and 1000 ms for R1 and 10p, 30, 50p, 70, 90p, and 110 ms for R2. Asterisks ( p ) indicate points duplicated for estimation of uncertainties: 2.8 seconds of recovery was used for all R1 and R2 experiments. In the CPMG trains of the R2 measurements, the p pulses were applied at a rate of 1600 Hz. Spectra for 15N{1H} NOE were acquired with and without 3.5 seconds of proton saturation. Saturated spectra had additional relaxation delays of 5.5 seconds to allow full 15N recovery. Non-saturated spectra used ten seconds of recovery of the water signal to minimize saturation transfer. Pairs of NOE spectra were collected in triplicate for measuring Isat/Inonsat and uncertainties.35 Relaxation data were processed, fit, and analyzed as reported.35 Relationships of 15N relaxation rates to spectral densities are well known.28,35 Model-free calculations employed ModelFree 4.0.67 The spectral density expression that minimized the AIC criterion of x2 þ 2k; where k is the number of parameters from among S2, te, S Rex and S2, was selected.38 For residues that the f AIC-based model selection suggested to be fit optimally by the expression using S2, long te and S2, a simplified S f expression retaining only S2 and long te was evaluated S as an alternative. For the free state of N-TIMP-1, the simpler two-parameter alternative was selected by the AIC criterion for 37 residues. Figures 3(c), 5, and 6(b) were made using MolMol.68  bmrb.wisc.edu

Residual dipolar coupling analysis PEG(C12E6) (5%) and 1-hexanol at a molar ratio69 of 0.64 were mixed with 15N/2H-N-TIMP-1 bound to 15 N-Ile,Val, 15N/13C-Leu MMP-3 E202Q, yielding 0.17 mM complex. The weak alignment at 14 T was homogeneous and stable, judging from the 22 Hz splitting and sharpness of the 2H2O line at 32 8C. 1DNH RDCs were measured from IPAP-HSQC.70 R2/R1 versus 1DNH was used to screen for chemical exchange.39 The 1DNH RDCs were fitted to X-ray coordinates 1UEA of the TIMP-1/MMP-3(DC) complex6 by SVD fitting of the Saupe order tensor to the amide coordinates of successive sets of five neighboring residues (quintets) using the method and software as described.29 Structural error decreases the reliability of alignment tensors.71 Gaussian ° noise with uncertainties (1s) of ^0.23 A in the coordinates of the complex and ^1 Hz for 1DNH was sampled by 1024 £ 1024 trials for estimating the range of possible alignment tensor parameters.29 The range of positional uncertainty in the X-ray coordinates was conservatively ° taken as a sixth of the 2.8 A resolution,29 equivalent to 1s of uncertainty in the amide H­ N bond orientation of ° ^138. An uncertainty of ^ 0.23 A is of similar proportion to the backbone uncertainty estimated from perturbations of an X-ray structure refinement.72 The structural uncertainty: (i) introduces uncertainty in the alignment tensor; (ii) relieves ambiguity in some tensors; and (iii) makes an outlying range of the tensor parameter more statistically significant.29 Configurational entropy and surface burial Changes of configurational entropy DSconf between states B and F, for bound and free, were proposed to relate to the Lipari ­Szabo order parameter SLZ describing pico- to nanosecond bond reorientations:27 DSconf ¼ Sconf;B 2 Sconf;F ¼ Nk lnðð3 2 ð1 þ 8SLZ;B Þ1=2 Þ=ð3 2 ð1 þ 8SLZ;F Þ1=2 ÞÞ ð1Þ

DcP;pol ¼ 20:26;13 or DcP;npol ¼ 0:32 ^ 0:04 and DcP;pol ¼ 20:14 ^ 0:0444 in units of cal mol21 K21. Later reports found DcP;npol ¼ 0:51 and DcP;pol ¼ 20:2145 or DcP;npol ¼ 0:28 ^ 0:12 and DcP;pol ¼ 20:09 ^ 0:3046 in units of cal mol21 K21. Changes in polar and apolar surface areas for use with equations (2) and (4) were measured with NACCESS v2.1.1. To prepare X-ray coordinates for surface measurements, water molecules were deleted and hydrogen atoms were added using Sybyl 6.3 (Tripos Associates, St Louis, MO). Surface ° measurements used a probe radius of 1.4 A and slice °. width of 0.05 A

where k is the Boltzmann constant and N is Avogadro's number. SLZ were measured at 293 K for free N-TIMP135 (for maintaining its solubility) and 307 K for the 34 kDa complex (for sharpening its lines). A temperature of 298 K was used to estimate 2TDSconf ; introducing error , 5% in 2TDSconf ; since SLZ is insensitive to temperature over a range where the protein is folded;73 all sites compared in this way, except for C-terminal residues 125 and 126, satisfy this criterion. A small systematic increase in librational motions at the 307 K of the bound state is likely. Enthalpy of protein­ protein association was proposed to be calculable from equations (2) and (3).13 Enthalpy depends linearly upon surface burial: DH860 8C ¼ Dhnpol DAnpol þ Dhpol DApol ð2Þ ° where Dhnpol ¼ 2 7.27 cal (mol A2)21 and Dhpol ¼ 29.16 ° 2)21.13 The estimate of DH860 8C is then used to cal (mol A predict DH at the desired temperature:34 DH8T2 ¼ DH8T1 þ DCp ðT2 2 T1 Þ ð3Þ

Empirical relationships of DCp of protein unfolding to changes in accessible surface area (ASA) were proposed, in which surface burial DA has a negative sign:13,44 DCp ¼ DcP;npol DAnpol þ DcP;pol DApol ð4Þ
