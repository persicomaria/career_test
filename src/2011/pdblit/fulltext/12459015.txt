The specificity of the immune response relies on processing of foreign proteins and presentation of antigenic peptides at the cell surface. Inhibition of antigen presentation, and the subsequent activation of T-cells, should, in theory, modulate the immune response. The cysteine protease Cathepsin S performs a fundamental step in antigen presentation and therefore represents an attractive target for inhibition. Herein, we report a series of potent and reversible Cathepsin S inhibitors based on dipeptide nitriles. These inhibitors show nanomolar inhibition of the target enzyme as well as cellular potency in a human B cell line. The first X-ray crystal structure of a reversible inhibitor cocrystallized with Cathepsin S is also reported.
Introduction Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple sclerosis (MS) occur when a sustained, adaptive immune response is mounted against self-antigens resulting in chronic inflammation and injury to the tissues. The modulation of antigen-specific immune responses has long been a desirable approach for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. In autoimmune diseases, self-proteins are internalized by antigen presenting cells, degraded into peptides, and then delivered to the cell surface in association with the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class II molecules. The MHC Class II/peptide complex engages CD4+ T cells, which precipitates an immune response. Although the biochemical events involved in antigen processing and presentation are complex,1-5 clear targets exist within the pathway that are amenable to therapeutic intervention. MHC Class II heterodimers have been shown to associate intracellularly with a molecule designated Invariant Chain (Ii).6 Invariant Chain interacts directly with the MHC Class II binding groove and must be proteolyzed prior to antigen loading and presentation. Current research suggests that Invariant Chain is selectively proteolyzed by a series of aspartyl and cysteine proteases within the endosomal compartments of the cell.4 In the final step of this proteolysis Cathepsin S, a 24 kD cysteine protease from the papain superfamily degrades the remaining Invariant Chain oligomer (Iip10) to a small peptide termed

CLIP. CLIP is subsequently released from the MHC Class II binding groove by association with a third protein termed HLA-DM.7,8 Once CLIP is released, the free MHC Class II binding groove loads with antigenic peptides. The MHC Class II peptide complexes are then transported to the cell surface for presentation to T-cells, and the immune response is initiated. Cathepsin S, through proteolysis of Invariant Chain, provides a fundamental step in the generation of the immune response and therefore is an attractive target for immunoregulation. Recent work has shown that splenocytes from mice deficient in Cathepsin S have impaired Invariant Chain processing and peptide loading.9,10 Cathepsin S acts catalytically through the nucleophilic addition of the thiolate anion of cysteine-25 (formed as an ion-pair with histidine-164) to the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond followed by hydrolysis to yield the peptide products. Most of the inhibitors of cysteine proteases reported in the literature depend on the chemical interaction of an electrophilic "warhead" with the cysteine thiolate anion of the active site and, in principle, the enzyme can be inactivated either irreversibly or reversibly by such inhibitors.11-17 Irreversible inhibitors, such as the dipeptide-vinyl sulfone LHVS12-14 or the epoxide E64,15 have been shown to be effective inhibitors of Cathepsin S. Since irreversible inhibitors have the potential drawback of haptenization which could cause immunogenicity, we chose to focus on the design of reversible inhibitors. Reversible inhibitors of Cathepsin S and related enzymes, both with and without an electrophilic warhead, have been reported in the patent literature.17-20 Reversible inhibitors with electrophilic warheads, such as R,R-bis-amino ketones, have also been shown to inhibit the closely related cysteine protease Cathepsin K.17 Palmer et al.18 described the use of peptidyl sulfones as reversible inhibitors of Cathepsin S, while Klaus et al.19,20 have reported that peptidyl ethylenediamines inhibit Cathepsin S reversibly, though, in each case no covalent bond to Cys25 is formed. Nitriles are known to be inhibitors of

cysteine proteases and were first reported by Hanzlik as inhibitors of the plant protease papain.21 These peptide nitriles were shown by NMR to form covalent bonds with the active site cysteine, and this bond formation was shown to be reversible. At the time we began our work there were no reports of peptide nitriles as inhibitors of Cathepsins, and we chose to explore the feasibility of this approach.22-32 Synthetic Chemistry. The nitrile inhibitors of this study were prepared by three different general methods. In Method A, as described in Scheme 1, treatment of the commercially available N-Boc amino acids with EDC, HOBt, and NH4OH followed by Boc-deprotection with either HCl/dioxane or TFA/CH2Cl2 led to amino amide salts 1. Reaction of the commercially available tosylate or hydrochloride salts of either the benzyl or methyl esters of amino acids with commercially available 4-morpholinecarbonyl chloride in DMF with Hunig's base followed by de-esterification of the esters led to carboxylic acids 2. Coupling of carboxylic acids 2 and amino amide salts 1 mediated by EDC/HOBt followed by dehydration of the terminal primary amide with a combination of cyanuric chloride in DMF provided the desired dipeptide nitriles. In Method B, as described in Scheme 2, coupling of amino amide salts 1 to commercially available N-Boc amino acids, Boc-deprotection, coupling with carboxylic acids, and dehydration of the terminal amide provided the desired dipeptide nitriles. In addition, a number of the analogues discussed below were prepared via a combination of a parallel

synthesis of the dipeptide amides on solid-phase followed by a solution-phase dehydration as outlined for Method C in Scheme 3.33 N-Fmoc protected Sieberamide resin was deprotected with piperidine in DMF followed by coupling with commercially available NFmoc amino acids. Fmoc-deprotection was followed by EDC/HOBt-mediated coupling with 4-methyl-2-[(morpholine-4-carbonyl)-amino]-pentanoic acid 2a. Cleavage of the amide from the resin was accomplished with 10% TFA/CH2Cl2. The dehydration with cyanuric chloride/ DMF was performed in a parallel solution-phase operation. The final products were purified by a combination of solid-phase extraction followed by purity-analysis by reverse-phase HPLC. The methylene homologue of inhibitor 6 was prepared in the manner outlined in Scheme 4. N-Boc-L-homophenylalanine was converted to a mixed anhydride using isobutyl chloroformate and N-methylmorpholine in THF. The mixed anhydride was reduced with NaBH4 in MeOH/H2O/THF to give alcohol 3. Mesylation with the sulfonyl chloride was followed by displacement of the mesylate with cyanide anion in DMSO to give Bocprotected nitrile 4. Deprotection of the nitrile with 50% TFA/CH2Cl2 followed by coupling of the deprotected nitrile to carboxylic acid 2a afforded the homologous nitrile 5. Biochemistry.

Inhibitor activity is measured by diminished fluorescence compared to DMSO control when read at 360 nm excitation and 460 nm emission. The Kd values were determined by a fluorescencebased equilibrium competitive binding assay using either of the dansylated compounds 11a,b as the fluorescent probe (see Experimental Section for details). Kinetic parameters kon and koff were determined using a ligand-exchange assay as described in the Experimental Section. Results and Discussion

Table 1. Importance of the Nitrile for Activity

The goal for this work was to answer three fundamental questions: (1) can nitriles act as potent, reversible inhibitors of Cathepsin S; (2) what are the optimal residues for P1, P2, and P3;34 and (3) can dipeptide nitriles afford inhibition of Cathepsin S in a cellular system? To address these questions, dipeptide nitrile 6 was synthesized as the first member of the series (Figure 1). Compound 6 was found to be a potent and reversible inhibitor of Cathepsin S (IC50 ) 42 nM, Kd ) 7 ( 2 nM) (Table 1). Reversibility of complexation of 6 with Cathepsin S was demonstrated by three different methods (see Experimental Section for details): (1) incubation of 6 with Cathepsin S and analysis of the sample solution via HPLC/MS demonstrated that the inhibitor does not irreversibly modify the enzyme; (2) kinetic constants (kon and koff) could be measured for a number of the nitrile inhibitors by a ligand-exchange assay; and (3) sizeexclusion-chromatography of a sample of excess 6

incubated with Cathepsin S restored catalytic activity to the enzyme. With these results in hand, the necessity of the nitrile for potency was further explored. Replacement of the nitrile with a hydrogen atom resulted in a dramatic loss in potency (compound 7, IC50 > 28000 nM, Table 1), lending support to the theory that the nitrile functions as an electrophilic warhead. However, one

could still argue that the nitrile was acting as a lipophilic group and its replacement with a hydrogen results in a loss of some favorable hydrophobic interaction with the enzyme. To test this theory, we replaced the nitrile of inhibitor 6 with a methyl group, which also gave an inactive compound (compound 8, IC50 > 339000 nM). Comparison of dipeptide nitrile 9 (IC50 ) 124 nM) with compound 10 (IC50 ) 97000 nM) demonstrates that the dramatic loss in activity is also observed when the nitrile is replaced by the similarly hybridized alkyne. To assess the importance of the nitrile's location on the inhibitor backbone, we prepared a methylene analogue of inhibitor 6 (compound 5, IC50 > 13000 nM) which also resulted in a great loss in potency. Whether the loss of activity for compound 5 is electronic in nature or is due to a geometric restraint is unknown. We concluded from these experiments that the nitrile is critical for potency against Cathepsin S and is not simply acting as a lipophilic substituent. This conclusion was later supported by solution of the X-ray structure of compound 22 cocrystallized with Cathepsin S (Figure 2b) which clearly shows electron density between the active-site cysteine residue and the nitrile carbon, indicating the formation of a reversible thio-imidate bond.

After establishing the importance of the nitrile, a systematic investigation of the SAR of the P1 residue was begun. Unbranched alkyl side chains showed a general trend toward somewhat increased potency with length (compounds 12-14, Table 2). However, branching at the -carbon of the amino acid residue gave less potent inhibitors (compounds 15, IC50 ) 1400 nM and 16, IC50 ) 107000 nM). The single exception to this trend is the phenylglycine derivative 17 which displays excellent potency (IC50 ) 51 nM and Kd ) 4 ( 2 nM). Phenylalanine at P1 proved to be less potent than homophenylalanine (compare inhibitors 6 and 18, Table 2), however, the loss in binding could be recovered by substituting on the phenylalanine ring with a halogen such as chlorine (compound 19, IC50 ) 56 nM). To our surprise, D-homophenylalanine derivative 20 (IC50 ) 387 nM, Kd ) 28 ( 6 nM) retained significant potency against Cathepsin S. While this result could possibly be explained by presence of a small amount of P1-epimer 6, such epimerization could not be detected by 1H NMR of a sample of 20. At an earlier stage of our investigation, we had established the configurational stability of inhibitor 6 at pH from 4.5 to 8. Only at pH ) 2 did inhibitor 6 show any formation of epimer 20 (4% of 6 had epimerized to 20 after 7 days). In addition, the formation of diastereomeric mixtures during inhibitor synthesis was observed only once from the many analogues synthesize (see experimental for P1-phenylglycine analogue 17). These results lead us to investigate an R,R-disubstituted amino acid as the P1-residue resulting in R,R-dimethylglycine analogue 21 which retained comparatively good potency (IC50 ) 114 nM). A breakthrough in the molecular potency occurred when the P1 position was substituted by O-benzyl serine analogues (compounds 22-25, Table 2) which resulted in picomolar binding constants to Cathepsin S. Orthoand meta-substitution of the benzyl group were found to be slightly more favorable than para-substitution (compare inhibitors 23 and 24 with inhibitor 25, Table 2).

Next we sought to optimize the P2 residue. Inverting the stereochemistry of the leucine residue of dipeptide nitrile 6 resulted in a weakly active inhibitor (compound 26, IC50 ) 11000 nM, Table 3). In addition, R-methylation of the P2 residue of inhibitor 6 resulted in nearly complete loss of activity (compound 27, IC50 ) 76000 nM). As with the P1 side chain, increasing the length of straight-chain alkyls at P2 improved the binding of the inhibitors to the enzyme; for example, changing from alanine to n-butylglycine, improves the IC50 from 134000 nM to 41 nM (compare inhibitors 28 and 29, Table 3). Mono-branching from the -carbon of the P2 residue results in some loss in potency unless the substituent more completely fills the S2 pocket (compare inhibitors 30 and 31, Table 3). Phenylalanine proved to be an unsatisfactory residue for the P2 position (inhibitor 32, Kd ) 60 ( 4 nM). Two optimal P2 residues were found to be L- -tert-butylalanine (inhibitor 33, Kd ) 0.9 ( 0.1 nM), and L- -cyclohexylalanine (inhibitor 34, Kd ) 0.8 ( 0.5 nM). With new P1 and P2 residues in hand, we began to combine the best of both groups in an attempt to gain synergistic improvement of our inhibitors (Table 4). For inhibitors bearing homophenylalanine and substituted or unsubstituted O-benzylserines as the P1 residue, the effect of changing the P2 residue from L-leucine to L- t-butylalanine or L- -cyclohexylalanine provided an improvement of between 3- and 20-fold based on comparison of Kds, providing a number of very potent picomolar inhibitors of Cathepsin S (inhibitors 33-36 and 38-40, Table 4). Replacing L-leucine with L- cyclohexylalanine at P2 resulted in a 4-fold improvement in the potency of the P1 phenylglycine analogues (compare inhibitors 17 and 41, Table 4). Replacing L-leucine with L- -cyclohexylalanine as the P2 residue resulted in an approximate 6-fold improvement in the potency of the inhibitor with R,R-dimethylglycine as the P1 residue (compare IC50s of inhibitors 21 and 42, Table 4). Solution of the crystal structure of inhibitor 22 complexed with Cathepsin S revealed that the O-benzylserine binds in the S1 pocket of the enzyme rather than in the S1 (Figure 2a).34 Examination of the structure

reveals that the lipophilic S2 pocket is large enough to accommodate P2 side chains larger than i-butyl which can explain the enhancement of potency seen with the larger side-chains such as neopentyl and cyclohexylmethyl. A number of acceptable P3 residues were also identified which were essentially equipotent to the morpholin4-yl series (inhibitors 36 and 43-46, Table 5). With potent inhibitors of the Cathepsin S enzyme in hand, we next investigated their activity in a cellular assay. The primary cellular assay was the same as developed by Riese et al.,5a in which HOM2 cells (human B cell line) are starved of methionine for 30 min, pulsed with 35S methionine and chased for 4 h in the presence of compound. After lysing, the MHC Class II and associated Invariant Chain is precipitated with mouse anti-human Class II monoclonal antibody Tu 36. Antibody/Class II complexes are subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the presence or absence of p10 Invariant Chain fragment (the natural Cathepsin S substrate) is determined by exposure of the gel to a PhosphorImager. The numbers reported in Table 4 are the lowest doses of compound at which the p10 band can be detected and are called the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). For each gel, the inactive nitrile 5 is used as a negative control at 1 µM for background subtraction. In general, L- -cyclohexylalanine as the P2 residue provided the most potent compounds in the cellular assay followed by L- -tert-butylalanine and L-leucine, the same order of potency based on the IC50s and Kds (compare inhibitors 6 and 33-34, 22 and 35-36, plus 37-39, Table 4). The most active compounds in cells were 34, 36, 41, and 42 with p10 MICs of 100 nM. Thus, the dipeptide nitriles afford inhibition of Cathepsin S in a cellular system. Study of the kinetics (kon and koff) of several of the more potent inhibitors revealed an interesting observation: inhibitor 42, with the dimethylglycine residue at P1, had on- and off-rates 2 to 3 orders of magnitude slower than the P1-monosubstituted inhibitors such as 6, 33, 22, 35, and 36 (Table 4). The explanation for this difference in behavior is not yet clear; however, the increased steric bulk about the electrophilic nitrile could account for the slower on-rate. Conclusion In the present report we have described the design of potent and reversible dipeptide nitrile inhibitors of the Cathepsin S enzyme. Systematic investigation of the SAR of the P1, P2, and P3 positions has provided picomolar inhibitors of Cathepsin S. We have presented the first published X-ray crystal structure of dipeptide nitriles cocrystallized with Cathepsin S and have shown that binding in the S1 selectivity site plays an important role in molecular potency. In addition, we have demonstrated that our dipeptide nitriles exhibit potency in a cellular assay. Finally, the detection of the p10 Invariant Chain fragment (the substrate for Cathepsin S) in the cellular assay demonstrates that we are inhibiting the molecular target in the cellular system.

Anal. (C24H29N5O3) C, H, N. Reversibility Studies. Cathepsin S was combined with 1 µL of a 5 mg/mL solution of inhibitor 6 in DMSO for a final ratio of 23 µM enzyme to 368 µM inhibitor. The sample was incubated 1 h at room temperature before injection onto a reverse-phase HPLC column (Vydac C18 column 2.0 × 250 mm). This was eluted with a gradient of 0.06% aqueous TFA to 0.052% TFA in acetonitrile over 25 min. UV detection at 210, 260, and 280 nm was used to identify and collect the Cathepsin S peak. The retention time of this peak was identical to that of the Cathepsin S peak from a control sample of Cathepsin S/DMSO. The collected fractions from the sample and the control sample were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry (Autospec OATOF MS (Micromass, Manchester UK). The mass spectrometer was scanned from m/z ) 1000-2000, and the resulting multiply charged spectra were deconvoluted with the Maxent software (Micromass) to calculate molecular weight. Known irreversible inhibitors such as E-64 and vinyl sulfones produce an adduct protein that is separated by the HPLC column from unaltered Cathepsin S and has a mass increased by the molecular weight of adduct. Only the mass for Cathepsin S (MW ) 24654) was detected with no adduct peak detected for Cathepsin S/6. In addition, samples Cathespin S incubated with 1000-fold concentrations of 6 and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography [Sephadex G-25 (NAP-5 Pharmacia) columns (0.5 mL)] followed by desalting show recovered enzymatic activity. Known irreversible compounds were not removed from the enzyme, and after desalting, the Cathepsin S enzyme activity was not restored. Competitive Binding Assay (Kd determination). The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for inhibitors were determined by a fluorescence-based equilibrium competitive binding assay. The reactants used in the competition assay were the more active inhibitors as determined by measuring IC50s, dansylated probes 11a and 11b and Cathepsin S. The Kd's for probes 11a and 11b were determined to be 10 and 8 nM, respectively, by methods previously described.35a Competition assays were performed in the following buffer: 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 2.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT. All pipet tips (Rainin Instrument Company, Inc.), Dynatech 96-well "U" bottom black microtiter plates (Dynex Technologies, Inc.), centrifuge tubes, and reagent reservoirs (Matrix Technologies Corp) were siliconized with Sigmacote (Sigma SL2). The inhibitors and probes were solubilized in DMSO. Competition reactions were initiated by adding a preincubated mixture of 2 µM dansylated probe (11a or 11b) and 600 nM of Cathepsin S to microtiter plate wells containing serially diluted inhibitors. Final concentrations of Cathepsin S and dansylated probe were 300 nM and 1 µM, respectively. The reactions were allowed to come to equilibrium at room

Dipeptide Nitriles as Cathepsin S Inhibitors temperature for at least 1 h. Fluorescence intensities were measured on a Polarstar Fluostar 403 µBG Lab Technologies Platereader equipped with a 290 nm-excitation filter and 520535-nm emission filter. The fluorescence intensity of the dansylated probe is dependent upon resonance energy transfer between tryptophan residues of Cathepsin S and bound probe. The raw fluorescence data were converted to SAS data sets that included reactant concentrations. The data sets were fit for inhibitor Kd by applying ordinary nonlinear least-squares regression techniques to a competitive binding model using the Marquardt-Levenberg minimization method.35a Kinetic Binding Assay for the Determination of Rate Constants and Kd. Kinetic constants (kon, koff) for all compounds binding to Cathepsin S were determined using a ligand-exchange assay.35b The reactants for each experiment consisted of a dansylated probe (inhibitors 11a or 11b), inhibitor, and Cathepsin S. Assay buffer for all ligandexchange assays consisted of 50 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5, 2.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 2% v/v DMSO. Fluorescence changes with respect to time were measured using a KinTek stopped-flow instrument model SF-2001. Rate constants were determined by performing the kinetic assay as two half reactions. In the first reaction, Cathepsin S (600 nM) was preincubated with the dansylated probe (800 nM) in a final volume of 1 mL and loaded into one of the stopped-flow syringes. The other syringe was loaded with 800 nM compound in a final volume of 1 mL. Compounds were diluted from a DMSO stock to their final concentration in the assay buffer described above. The exchange reaction was then initiated by injecting 40 µL from each syringe at a flow rate of 10 mL/s into a quartz observation cell. The sample was excited at a wavelength of 290 nm from a 100-W mercury short arc lamp and fluorescence emission was detected through a PMT with an attached 505 nm long wave pass filter. The fluorescence intensity of the dansylated probe increases when bound to Cathepsin S. Data acquisition began at the start of the injection with a dead time of approximately 2 ms and continued until the reaction had reached equilibrium. The reaction temperature was held at 23 °C using an external water bath. The second reaction was carried out as the reciprocal of the first reaction. Cathepsin S (600 nM) was preincubated with compound (800 nM) and loaded into one of the stopped-flow syringes. The other syringe was loaded with 800 nM dansylated probe in a final volume of 1 mL. The exchange reaction was initiated and fluorescence was followed as described above. The above two reactions together constitute a paired receptorligand exchange reaction. The complementary data from these two reactions can be combined into a single data set and then modeled simultaneously for the rate constants. The derivation of the integrated rate equation describing the overall ligand exchange reaction has been described elsewhere.35b All of the data were analyzed using the SAS statistical software system (version 6.12, SAS Institute Incorporated, Cary, NC). Typically, two ASCII data files containing fluorescence measurements from a pair of ligand-exchange reactions were converted into a single SAS data set, with the respective subsets labeled as `association' or `dissociation' (referring to the disposition of the probe). Parameter estimates (kon, koff) were obtained by applying ordinary nonlinear least-squares regression techniques to a ligand exchange model using the Marquardt-Levenberg minimization method.35b Crystallization and Structure Determination. Purified Cathepsin S was mixed with compound 22 at a 5:1 ratio of compound:protein on ice and then concentrated to 10 mg/mL at 4 °C. Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion at room temperature in 2 µL hanging drops that contained an equal volume of protein complex and reservoir solution consisting of 1.6-2.0 M (NH4)2SO4. Crystals were briefly (about 10 s) soaked in 100 mM Na acetate pH 4.5, 2 M (NH4)2SO4, and 20% glycerol and flash-frozen under a cool -170 °C nitrogen stream for the diffraction experiments. The diffraction experiment was carried out using an R-AXIS-IIc image-plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU200 X-ray generator powered at 100 mA and 50 kV and equipped with Osmic focusing mirrors.

The structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMORE.39 Compound 22 was incorporated between rounds of model building using O40 and refinement using X-PLOR 98 (MSI, Inc.).41 The last round of refinement included simulated annealing carried out with CNS42 using maximum likelyhood target and bulk solvent correction but without constraints on noncrystallographic symmetry and then followed by individual temperature factor refinement. The refinement results are summarized in Table 6. The coordinates may be found in the Protein Data Bank under ID code 1MS6.
