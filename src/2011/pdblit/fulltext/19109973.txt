Abstract The synthesis, spectroscopic and electrochemical characterisation of a series of optically tuneable, ruthenium (II) and osmium (II) polypyridyl complexes, O,N coordinated to electroactive donor ligand, bis-2,5-(2-benzoxazolyl)-hydroquinone (bbhq) is described. The complexes exhibit a rich optical spectroscopy which can be controlled through the redox state of the metal and bbhq ligand. The influence of both the metal and counter-ligand identity on the optical properties of these hydroquinone-based complexes is addressed. Regardless of the identity of metal or counter-ligand, it is the bbhq which is the site of the most facile oxidation and hydroquinone, semiquinone (bbsq) and quinone (bbq) can be generated electrochemically. In each instance, the semiquinone is strongly stabilised with respect to disproportionation, reflected in large stability constants for this moiety. The levels of orbital mixing between metal and ligand are discussed on the basis of the optical properties of the complex and the nature of the metal and counter-ligand. In addition, we address, for the first time, the effect of metal and counter-ligand on the photostability, of Ru(II) and Os(II) hydroquinone bound complexes. We find that like other ruthenium (II) complexes containing strong r-bonding ligands, the M(bpy)2 containing complexes are photostable, but the [Ru(biq)2(bbhq)]+ complex is relatively photolabile. ” 2005 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction The ability to rationally tune the optical properties of redox and photoactive metal complexes across the visible and NIR spectrum is of significant value across a wide range of applications from solar sensitizers to biological probes to electrochromics. There are relatively few compounds whose absorbance extends to the NIR and which are in addition, easily optically tuned. Important examples include Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes which incorporate anionic oxygen donor ligands such as catechols or phenolates. Such complexes have been demonstrated to show very rich optical spectroscopy, the wavelengths of which, can be controlled by altering the redox state of the donor ligand or the metal [1]. For example, in such complexes

when the oxygen donor ligand is in a reduced state, these complexes exhibit MLCT Ru(II)≠L≠L(p*) (where L≠L represents for example, 2,2-bipyridyl) transitions upon which are imposed the much less common inter-ligand charge transfer ILCT transitions which can frequently extend to the NIR [2]. Oxidation of a hydroquinone or catechol ligand may result in additional new MLCT transitions to ligand SOMO states, again, these absorbances frequently extend well into the NIR spectral region [3]. Quinone/hydroquinone based ruthenium and osmium complexes have been demonstrated to exhibit significant mixing of metal and ligand orbitals of the non-innocent ligand and the extent of mixing is inherently dependent on the oxidation state of the ligand [4]. Almost invariably, the quinone state is shown to mix best, due most likely to the low-lying p* orbitals of this species [5,6]. Altering the nature of the counter ligand to change the acceptor levels in quinone/hydroquinone based ruthenium

and osmium complexes, for example from bipyridine to biquinoline, should permit tuning of both the ILCT and MLCT transitions. Indeed we recently demonstrated such optical tuning occurs in ruthenium and osmium complexes containing phenolate donors [3]. In these complexes, the metal, principally, was the first site of oxidation, and so in this report we extend these studies to identify the effect of altering metal and counter ligand identity on the optical properties of a hydroquinone complex, where the states can be further tuned by oxidation of the non-innocent hydroquinone ligand. In addition, we address, for the first time, the effect of metal and counter-ligand on the photostability, of the Ru(II) and Os(II) hydroquinone bound complexes. Ultimate application of these materials as sensitizers or in electrochromics requires that they exhibit photochemical stability. We anticipated that they would be reasonably stable given the strong r-donor nature of the anionic hydroquinone ligand and indeed find that compared to [Ru(bpy)3]2+ they are photochemically stable, however this stability is particularly dependent on the p-acceptor ability of the counter-ligand. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials D8-bpy was synthesised according to published methods (Supplementary data). Dichloride complexes, cis-Ru(bpy)2Cl2, Ru(d8-bpy)2Cl2, Os(bpy)2Cl2, Ru(d8-bpy)2Cl2, cis-Ru(biq)2Cl2, where bpy is 2,2-bipyridine and biq is 2,2-biquinoline, were synthesised according to standard techniques [7≠9]. Bis-2,5-(2-benzoxazolyl)-hydroquinone (bbhq) was synthesised according to the method described by Mordzinski and Grabowski et al. [10≠12]. All reagents, purchased from Sigma≠Aldrich, were used as received. 2.2. Metal complexes 2.2.1. [Ru(bpy)2(bbhq)](PF6) Bbhq (352 mg, 93 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol/water (3:1 v/v, 60 cm3). This solution was heated and adjusted to pH 10.96, with conc. NaOH. [Ru(bpy)2Cl2] ∆ 2H2O (500 mg, 1.03 mmol) dissolved in ethanol/water (1:1 v/v, 40 cm3) was added slowly over 30 min. The mixture was heated under reflux for 7.5 h after which time the brown solution was reduced in volume by rotary evaporation to approximately 10 cm3. The complex was re-dissolved in methanol/dichloromethane/water and several drops of saturated aqueous NH4PF6 were subsequently added to the solution. The resulting brown precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration. Yield (65.64%). Anal. Calc. for RuC40H27N6O4PF6: C, 53.28; H, 3.02; N, 9.32. Found: C, 53.32; H, 3.04; N, 9.0%. 2.2.2. [Os(bpy)2(bbhq)](PF6) [Os(bpy)2(bbhq)](PF6) was synthesised as described for [Ru(bpy)2(bbhq)](PF6). Bbhq (184 mg, 48 mmol) was dis-

solved in ethanol/water (3:1 v/v, 60 cm3). This solution was heated and adjusted as for [Ru(bpy)2(bbhq)](PF6). [Os(bpy)2Cl2] ∆ 2H2O (250 mg, 44 mmol) was used in this case. The resulting dark brown precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration. Yield (53.49%). Anal. Calc. for OsC40H27N6O4PF6 ∆ 2.5H2O: C, 46.42; H, 3.12; N, 8.12. Found: C, 46.32; H, 2.71; N, 8.00%. 2.2.3. [Ru(biq)2(bbhq)](PF6) [Ru(biq)2(bbhq)](PF6) was synthesised as described for [M(bpy)2(bbhq)](PF6). Bbhq (278 mg, 73 mmol) and [Ru(biq)2Cl2] ∆ 2H2O (450 mg, 66 mmol) was used. The resulting green precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration. Yield (50.92%). Anal. Calc. for RuC56H35N6O4PF6: C, 60.06; H, 3.33; N, 7.63. Found: C, 59.22; H, 3.73; N, 8.04%. All complexes were purified by column chromatography on neutral alumina using methanol as mobile phase. All bbhq complexes were columned at least three times to ensure purity, which was confirmed using HPLC.

3. Physical measurements High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed on a Shimadzu liquid chromatograph LC10AD HPLC pump using a Waters 2487 dual wavelength absorbance detector. A 20 ll injector loop and a cation exchange column partisil SCX radial PAK cartridge were employed. The detection wavelength was 280 nm and mobile phase was 80:20 (v/v) acetonitrile:water containing 0.1 mol dm¿3 lithium perchlorate. The flow rate was set at 2 ml/min. Proton NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker AC 400 or Varian 200 MHz spectrometer. Measurements were carried out in d3-acetonitrile or d6-DMSO. Peak positions are relative to TMS (r, 0 ppm) and solvent peaks. Electronic absorption spectra were measured using a Shimadzu 3500 UV≠Vis/NIR spectrophotometer or a Perkin≠Elmer lambda 900 UV≠Vis/NIR spectrometer. Spectra were deconvoluted into Gaussians using standard iterative algorithms [13]. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out using a CH instruments Model 660 or 602a electrochemical workstation and a scan rate of 100 mV s¿1 was used unless otherwise stated. Electrochemical studies were conducted in high purity HPLC grade solvents, dried over molecular sieves; 0.1 mol dm¿3 tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) was used as the supporting electrolyte. A three-electrode system was used with a non-aqueous Ag/ Ag+ electrode. The working electrode was a 3 mm diameter teflon shrouded glassy carbon and a platinum wire was used as the auxiliary electrode. All solutions were degassed using nitrogen gas, and a blanket of nitrogen was maintained over the solution during all experiments. The unreactive redox couple Fc+/Fc (E0 = 0.312 V vs. Ag/Ag+) was employed as an internal standard [14].

Spectroelectrochemistry was carried out using a quartz, thin layer cell (1 mm) manufactured in-house. The optically transparent working electrode was a platinum rhodium gauze (transmittance >62%) which was inserted fully into the cell. The auxiliary electrode was a platinum wire and the reference electrode was Ag/Ag+. The solvent and electrolyte were as described above. The working electrode was held at the required potential throughout the measurement using a CH instruments 602a electrochemical workstation. Raman spectroscopy was conducted on a Dilor.Jobinyvon.Spex. The exciting 20 mW He≠Ne laser (632.8 nm) or 25 mW Ar+ laser (514.5, 488 and 457.9 nm), laser was focused (using a 100∑ or 50∑ objective lens) on solid material or on a cuvette mounted in the path of the laser beam. Resonance Raman spectra of electrochemically-generated species were recorded using the Spectroelectrochemical set-up described above. The laser beam was focused through the OTTLE cell onto the surface of the optically transparent platinum gauze surface using a 10∑ objective lens. A spectral resolution of 1.5 cm¿1 per pixel was achieved using a grating of 1800 lines/mm. 4. Results and discussion 4.1. Structural characterisation The ligand in [Ru(bpy)2bbhq]+, structures are illustrated in Scheme 1. The coordination compounds discussed were synthesised according to standard techniques. The addition of base was necessary in order to deprotonate a hydroxyl group on bbhq to render it a better coordination site. Cation exchange HPLC, elemental analysis, and 1H NMR spectroscopy were employed to verify the purity and structure of resulting complexes. The ruthenium bbhq≠based complexes are anticipated to be diamagnetic and accordingly, sharp, well defined 1H NMR resonances were

observed for all ruthenium bbhq-based complexes, consistent with the presence of both Ru(II) and hydroquinone in its reduced state. A complete assignment of all Bbhqbased resonances could be made employing a combination of COSY 1H NMR experiments and deuteriation of the bipyridine ligands (Supplementary data). The 1H NMR spectrum was complicated for the Os based complex, by extensive broadening. This was attributed to the fact that the ligand in [Os(bpy)2bbhq]+, exists at least partially, in its semiquinone state under ambient conditions. This is consistent with the electrochemical data described below, which reveals that the oxidation potential for the hydroquinone lies at negative potential and that the semiquinone is the dominant species at open circuit potential. Addition of sodium borohydride reduced the ligand back to its bbhq state and sharp, NMR resonances could be obtained. This behaviour has been noted previously in osmium hydroquinone and catechol complexes [5b]. The NMR resonances for coordinated bbhq are shifted significantly upfield with respect to the free ligand, particularly for the hydroquinone (HQ) moiety (Supplementary data). [Ru(bpy)2bbhq]+ shows shifts in its bbhq resonances by comparison to the free ligand, where the most deshielded protons were H5, H11, H10 and H1. Least affected protons were H2 and H9 as they are the furthest from the coordination site. A similar argument may be applied to [Os(bpy)2bbhq]+, where shifts of a similar nature were observed indicating that Os is coordinated via the oxygen as a result of deprotonation of the H12 proton. [Ru(biq)2bbhq]+ experiences shifts of a similar nature to the [M(bpy)2bbhq]+. Again H5 and H11 experience the largest deshielding. The fact that H7 and H8 are not affected to any great extent in any of the complexes implies that the H6 hydroxyl is protonated. This is further confirmed from elemental analysis which demonstrates that one PF6 ion compensates the charge on the complexes. If the hydroquinone were fully deprotonated the complexes would have no net charge.1 5. Electronic spectroscopy The electronic spectroscopy for the complexes discussed are shown in Fig. 1. Intense absorbances are evident in the UV region assigned to p≠p* ligand based transitions. For [Ru(bpy)2bbhq]+ in its reduced, native state, the most intense visible transition, which from Gaussian fitting, is centred at 481 nm (e = 8109 M¿1 cm¿1), is assigned to a Ru(t2g) to bpy(p*) MLCT transition. In addition an intense shoulder is apparent, centred at 680 nm extending into the NIR and is attributed to an inter-ligand charge transfer namely, a bbhq (p)-bpy (p*) transition [1,15,16]. Similarly, for [Os(bpy)2bbhq]+ in its reduced state an Os(II)-bpy MLCT transition was observed at 493 nm (e = 9570 M¿1 cm¿1), with a shoulder centred around
1 IR spectroscopy also confirmed the presence of PF6 ion in each instance.

700 nm assigned to a bbhq (p)-bpy (p*) transition. By comparison to other Os complexes, a lower energy band at 959 nm is attributed to an Os (dp)≠bpy (3p*) singlet to triplet transition, rendered allowed by spin≠orbit coupling of the heavy osmium atom. For [Ru(biq)2bbhq]+ the band at 624 nm (e = 6056 M¿1 cm¿1) occurs at an energy comparable to that of the MLCT band of the [RuII(biq)3]2+ ion [17]. The [Ru(biq)2bbhq]+ also exhibits a low energy transition, assigned to an ILCT band ($720 nm) arising from the transfer of an electron from an orbital centred on the electron rich bbhq to a p* orbital of the relatively electron deficient biq ligand. The lowest energy optical transition is intense and is part of the envelope centred around 650 nm, which also contains the Ru(dp)≠biq(p*) MLCT transition. The red shift of the bbhq≠biq ILCT and its increased intensity by comparison with the bpy containing complexes is accounted for by the better p* accepting ability of biq. 6. Electrochemistry The electrochemical data for these mononuclear compounds are presented in Table 1. The cyclic voltammetry for [Ru(bpy)2bbhq]+ is shown in Fig. 2, reversible oneand two-electron oxidation steps are observed by at Eox (V) 0.03 and 0.78 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The first oxidation step, based on the optical spectroscopy of this complex is likely

to be located on the bbhq ligand, the origin of the lowest energy optical transition and this step is therefore assigned as a bbhq/bbsq couple. The two-electron step is partially resolved into two separate waves at 0.55 and 0.78 V (E1/2 0.564 and 0.635 V) (vs. Ag/Ag+) which are attributed to semiquinone/quinone and a one-electron metal centred Ru(II)/Ru(III) oxidations, respectively. This sequence of oxidation has been observed in other hydroquinone bound Ru(bpy)2 complexes [16] and is further confirmed, vide infra, by spectroelectrochemistry. Two reversible one-electron reductions are observed at ¿1.28 and ¿1.56 V and are assigned, from consideration of comparable materials to the reductions of the bpy moieties. For [Os(bpy)2bbhq]+, two reversible 1e¿ oxidations appear at ¿0.21 and 1.12 V and an irreversible oxidation at 1.41 V. Again, the sequence of oxidations is attributed to ligand, and then metal. Two reversible one-electron reductions, attributed to the bpy counter ligands are observed at E1/2 ¿1.46 and ¿1.57 V. There is a general cathodic trend in the osmium electrochemistry by comparison with the ruthenium analogue. For example, the first oxidation for [Os(bpy)2bbhq]+ occurs 230 mV cathodic of the analogous oxidation for [Ru(bpy)2bbhq]+. That the ligand oxidations are so strongly affected by the metal identity suggests that there is significant mixing of metal and ligand states. Indeed, this is also reflected in the bipyridyl reductions which are shifted to a comparable extent. According to periodic trends the potential difference between the Os metal (5d orbital) and the Ru metal (4d orbital) usually results in a cathodic shift of approximately 300 mV for the osmium oxidation compared with ruthenium in analogous complexes. However, remarkably, in this case, the osmium oxidation is shifted anodically by approximately 600 mV. As the ligand oxidations precede the metal, we attribute this large shift to increased p-delocalisation of the electron poor quinone and osmium states, which drains electron density from the metal forcing it to higher oxidation potential [18]. For [Ru(biq)2bbhq]+, cyclic voltammetry reveals three one-electron oxidations at 0.23, 0.88 (quasi rev) and 1.51 V which are similarly assigned to the bbhq/bbsq, bbsq/bbq and Ru(II)/Ru(III) couples. Substantial anodic shifts in the oxidation processes, for example, the 200 mV shift in the bbhq/bbsq couple, for [Ru(biq)2bbhq]+ by com-

parison with [Ru(bpy)2bbhq]+, reflect significant communication between the bbhq and counter ligand. Two reversible one-electron reductions are observed at E1/2 ¿1.14 and ¿1.31 V and assigned to the 2,2 0 -biquinoline ligands. The anodic shift of the one-electron metal-centred oxidation process compared with [Ru(bpy)2bbhq]+ is rationalised on the basis of the greater p-acceptor ability biq [19]. 7. Optical spectroelectrochemistry To obtain further insight into the nature of the electrochemical processes, UV≠VIS spectroelectrochemistry (SEC) was employed. Fig. 3 shows the spectroelectrochemical response of [Ru(bpy)2bbhq]+. After the first one-electron oxidation (holding the potential at 0.2 V) the RuII≠ bpy(p*) MLCT band at 480 nm shifts to approximately

460 nm as a consequence of stabilisation of the t2g level due to the reduced the r-donating capacity of the ligand in the semiquinone state. That the MLCT remains, confirms that it is the ligand and not the metal which is oxidised at this potential. In addition, at 0.2 V, the ILCT band at 680 nm is lost and an intense and extremely broad feature (FWHM $500 nm) appears around 1420 nm. This feature is assigned to a RuII dp≠bbsq (p*) MLCT transition by comparison with related dinuclear Ru(bpy)2 complexes containing 2,5-dipyrazol-1-yl-benzene-1,4-diol [16]. The remarkable width of this transition suggests that there is little charge delocalisation between the semiquinone ligand and the metal and that the transition is very much charge transfer in nature [20]. Such transitions are expected to be solvent sensitive as a result of the necessity for the solvent dipoles to compensate for the resulting charge transfer state. We confirmed this by generating this species in dichloromethane, which resulted in a significant blue shift in the absorbance of the RuII dp≠bbsq (semiquinone p*) MLCT (Supplementary data) confirming significant charge trapping of the semiquinone radical across the complex. At 0.6 V, Fig. 3 (inset), the 1420 nm feature disappears and a weaker, sharper absorbance at 930 nm grows in. Again, the MLCT persists, although it is further blue shifted. The 930 nm transition is therefore attributed to a RuII dp≠ bbq (quinone p*) MLCT [15,16,20,5]. This transition is also solvent dependent, this time exhibiting a red shift in DCM to 1013 nm. Holding the potential at 1.0 V, the RuII≠bpy(p*) MLCT gradually disappears as the metal is oxidised to Ru(III). Simultaneously, a band at 915 nm appears assigned as a LMCT bpy≈¿≠Ru(III) transition. These processes were confirmed reversible as the original spectrum was recovered upon re-reduction. In addition, the presence of clear isosbestic points for each oxidation process suggests that the reactions are clean with no intermediate formation. Importantly, for the first oxidation

step, this suggests that the semiquinone is stable at 0.2 V and is not prone to disproportionation. Comparable spectroelectrochemical results were obtained for [Ru(biq)2bbhq]+ and [Os(bpy)2bbhq]. The spectroelectrochemical response for [Os(biq)2bbhq]+ is shown in Fig. 4 at 0.4 V the MLCT shifts to the blue and the 650 nm shoulder is lost. Simultaneously a broad band centred around 1400 nm (FWHM $575 nm) appears, assigned to a RuII dp≠bbsq (p*) MLCT transition. Two contributing bands appear to be present at this wavelength, which is thought to be due to two charge transfer transitions arising from both the dxy and the dyz energy levels within the t2g manifold [21]. At 1.1 V the MLCT at 1400 nm disappears and a new, sharper feature appears at 1100 nm, attributed to a RuII dp≠bbq (p*) MLCT process. At 1.6 V, the RuII≠biq(p*) MLCT band and the transition at 1100 nm is lost as RuII is oxidised to RuIII. Concomitantly, a new feature appears, centred around 918 nm, which is assigned as a LMCT bpy ≈¿ ≠Ru(III) transition. Again, all processes were confirmed reversible and isosbestic points maintained throughout each step. Finally, for [Os(bpy)2bbsq] the Os(II)≠bpy (p*) MLCT transition at 493 nm remains throughout the first oxidation (0.8 V) and in this instance, two new, weak, broad bands appear centred around 1360 and 2360 nm which are tentatively assigned as 1MLCT as Os(II) to bbsq (p*) and a 3 MLCT Os(II) to bbsq (p*). The added complexity in the Os spectra are attributed to the spin≠orbit coupling of this heavy metal which relaxes the spin forbidden nature of these transitions [22,23]. At 1.2 V the MLCT band continues to persist while the 1360 and 2360 nm bands are lost. Two new transitions centred around 906 and 1940 nm grow in and are assigned to Os(II) to bbq (p*) 1MLCT and 3 MLCT from Os(II) to bbq (p*) transitions. At 1.6 V as OsII is oxidised to OsIII the MLCTs are lost. Again, unlike

some previously reported Os catechol complexes it is the ligand which oxidises first in this system [24]. Again, all processes are confirmed chemically reversible and isosbestic points maintained for the first step confirm the semiquinone state is stabilised against disproportionation. 8. Resonance Raman spectroscopy When the exciting laser is coincident with an electronic transition in Raman it is said to be resonant. Under these conditions, the symmetric vibrational modes associated with the chromophoric units are selectively enhanced by up to seven orders of magnitude. Resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy is then a valuable means of identifying the origin of optical transitions in optically rich complexes such as these. At open circuit potential for [Ru(bpy)2bbhq]+, 514 nm excitation is resonant the Ru (dp)≠bpy (p*) MLCT at 480.7 nm and somewhat preresonant with high-energy tail of the ILCT. Correspondingly, the resulting resonance Raman spectrum shown in Fig. 5(a), exhibits features associated with both transitions, signature bipyridyl bands at 1608, 1558, 1488, 1320, 1269 and 1172 cm¿1 and Ru≠N stretch at 378 cm¿1 [1,15,25≠28]. In addition, bands associated with the bbhq ligand appear at 492 and 673 cm¿1 assigned to a Ru≠O (bbhq) coupled modes [28] and a feature at 1426 cm¿1 attributed to a ring stretch of the bbhq ligand. At 0.4 V, the signature modes for the Ru(t2g) to bpy (p*) transition remain, confirming that metal is unaffected by the first oxidation step. However, at this potential, the weak Ru≠O stretching modes at 492 and 673 cm¿1 are lost as the ILCT transitions disappears. The 1426 cm¿1 associated with the hydroquinone is shifted upon oxidation to 1429 cm¿1 which is thought to the same mode for the semiquinone species [33,34,29]. Similarly at 0.6 V, the bpy

modes and Ru(II)≠N stretch remain, albeit at reduced intensity because of weakened resonance of the 514 nm line with the blue shifted MLCT which indicates that the metal is still in its reduced state. New features appear at 1429 and 1159 cm¿1. These bands are not observed in the spectra of the parent complex and by comparison with other similar compounds [33,34] are assigned to the oxidised bbhq ligand deformations and a vibration at and 530 cm¿1 which is attributed to a Ru≠O quinonoid vibration. By comparison, Lever et al. [30] reported on vibrational modes at 1445 and 1209 cm¿1 which were assigned to the skeletal Ru≠Q and intraligand Q modes of Ru≠Q for (l-3,3 0 ,4,4 0 -tetramino3,3 0 ,4,4 0 -tetrahydrobiphenyl)bis[bis(bipyridine)ruthenium (II)](4+). Based on these comparisons it is proposed that the new features observed here are associated with quinone, however, as we are not resonant with any new optical transition at 514 nm, these are relatively weak. Similarly, exciting [Os(bpy)2bbhq]+ at 514 nm, the signature bpy and Os≠N anticipated when a Raman line is resonant with an Os(II)≠bpy MLCT transition are observed. Application of potentials in excess of the first two oxidation steps for this complex, like the analogous [Ru(bpy)2bbhq]+, sees the persistence of these bands, albeit with changes of intensity due to shifts in the optical spectroscopy and that it is the bbhq ligand which oxidises in these processes [31,30,34]. The RR spectrum for [Ru(biq)2bbhq]+ was excited at 514 nm, Fig. 5(b), which is pre-resonant with Ru(II)≠ biq(p*) transition and correspondingly exhibited resonantly enhanced features at 1421, 1457, 1370 and 1344 cm¿1 which correlate with vibrational modes observed for [Ru(biq)2(Cl)2] and other biquinoline based complexes [32]. A low intensity feature at 369 cm¿1 is attributed to a Ru≠N stretch. Weaker features observed at 1158, 1290 and 1516 cm¿1 are associated with the hydroquinone [33]. Their weak intensity is not surprising since

514 nm excitation does not probe the ILCT band for [Ru(biq)2bbhq]+ and they may be due post resonance with p≠p* transitions involving the bbhq. Resonance Raman of [Ru(biq)2bbhq]+ was also carried out using 632.8 nm excitation as shown in Fig. 6, which is directly resonant with both the MLCT Ru(II)≠biq (p*) transition and the ILCT transition. Vibrational modes were observed at: 371, 494, 538, 663, 798, 893 and 972 cm¿1 corresponding to hydroquinone and bridge coupled modes, 1158, 1344, 1373, 1424 and 1457 cm¿1. Vibrations at 1457, 1373, 1344 cm¿1 are associated with the complexed biquinoline ligand. 371 and 798 cm¿1 are due to a Ru≠N(biq) and Ru≠O stretches, respectively [34,28,32]. This confirmed that the lowest energy optical transition for [Ru(biq)2bbhq]+ is an ILCT. Potential controlled RR (kex 514 nm) on [Ru(biq)2bbhq]+ was conducted. At 0.7 V, the intensity of weak vibrations at 1096, 1158, 1290 and 1516 cm¿1 associated with hydroquinone [33] is decreased, whereas the intensity of biq modes increased due to a greater resonance with the excitation wavelength. From electronic SEC, as oxidation proceeds the 514 nm excitation line moves into resonance with a blue shifted MLCT accounting for vibrational enhancement of biquinoline modes. This again confirms that it is the bbhq and not the metal which oxidises first in this complex. Concomitantly, a 1575 cm¿1 mode appears which is indicative of a semiquinone species consistent with work reported by Vlcek [31]. At 1.0 V, 1575 cm¿1 disappears and a new, but weak vibration at 1639 cm¿1 associated with a C@O stretch of the quinone moiety appears, confirming that the bbhq undergoes successive oxidations to form a quinone. At higher potentials (1.6 V) the Ru(II)≠N stretch disappears as the metal is oxidised to Ru(III). Some biq modes are still present due to post resonance with LC p≠p* (biq) bands (kmax 357 nm) in the near-UV region.

In conclusion, Raman spectroelectrochemical data for each complex confirms the interpretation of the electrochemical results; that the ligand undergoes two one electron oxidations to form semiquinone and quinone which precedes the oxidation of the metal, regardless of metal or ancillary ligand identity. 9. Stabilisation comproportionation constant (Kc) Electrochemistry and spectroelectrochemistry established that for each complex reported, the first oxidation step is bbhq to bbsq. We reported previously on related [Ru(bpy)2LL]2+ mononuclear complexes where Ru is N,O coordinated to pyrazole and hydroxylate where LL was 1,4-dihydroxy-2,5-bis(pyrzol-1-yl) [16]. In these complexes, despite the structural similarities to the complexes presented here, we observed that the first oxidation step was a single two electron redox couple which produced the quinone. In other words, the semiquinone could not be isolated and this was only achieved in the analogous dimer [15]. In the mononuclear complexes reported here, remarkably, the semiquinone is stablised, and to a significant degree, reflected in the potential separations between the first and second oxidative processes. To quantify the extent of this stabilisation we calculated the comproportionation constant Kc(sq) (defined in Eqs. (1)≠(3)) for the semiquinone for each of the complexes studied: 2SQ ¢ Q ˛ HQ K csqﬁ º ΩQΩHQ

where DE0 is the potential difference between the two-oxidation processes observed for the ligand. The stability constants for the semiquinone species for all three mononuclear complexes are presented in Table 2. All three stability constants are very large. The reason the semiquinone is stabilised here but not in the analogous 1,4-dihydroxy-2,5-bis(pyrzol-1-yl) complex is unclear but may be related to increased ability of the extended aromatic system in bbhq to accommodate the radical. The metal identity has a profound affect on the stability of the semiquione with Kc(sq) of (3.10 ∑ 109) for the ruthenium complex compared with a remarkable 3.35 ∑ 1020 for the osmium analogue. It is thought that the greater p-acceptor properties of the Os centre accounts for this extra stabilisation. The influence of the counter ligand is less pronounced where Kc(sq) was calculated to be 2.98 ∑ 1010 for [Ru(biq)2bbhq]+. Again the increased stability may be due to the greater p-acceptor ability of biq compared to bpy which permits greater delocalisation of the radical state. 10. Photochemical stability Although the extended wavelength range for hydroquinone bound complexes makes them potential candidates in a range of applications, their photostability is an important issue [9]. For [Ru(bpy)3]2+ thermal population of

metal-centred excited states from the MLCT triplet state leads either to fast radiationless deactivation or to photodecomposition. The solution to reducing lability is to increase the t2g≠eg energy gap, and there are a number of synthetic approaches to achieve this. The most straightforward is to turn to Os where 10Dq is approximately 30% greater than Ru and, in general, complexes of Os(II) are photoinert [35]. Strong r-donor capacities of ligands such as triazoles [9], 2-(pyridin-2-yl)pyrazole [36] and 2-(pyridin-2-yl)imidazole [37] have been used to make the eg level inaccessible and increase the photostability of these complexes. The photostability of ruthenium or osmium polypyridyl complexes with O¿ donors has not, to our knowledge, been reported previously. We were interested to know if, like other strong r-donors, the O¿ donor could increase the photostability of these Ru(II) complexes. Photolysis experiments were carried out on all three complexes in dichloromethane containing 0.1 mol dm¿3 LiCl. Photolabilty was expected to be reflected in the substitution of one of the metal-ligand bonds with a chloride [38]. Both [Ru(bpy)2bbhq]+ and [Os(bpy)2bbhq]+ showed negligible change over 5 h visible irradiation [35]. Conversely, as shown in Fig. 7, significant changes in the spectrum of [Ru(bpy)2bbhq]+ taken over 7 h visible irradiation was observed. Interestingly, the resulting spectra appear to be similar to the corresponding spectrum for a first step oxidation (spectroelectrochemistry) and do not appear to correspond to the formation of Ru(biq)2Cl2. Also, the formation of Ru(biq)2Cl2 would be expected to result in the appearance of a peak in the UV region corresponding to uncomplexed 2,2 0 -biquinoline which was not observed. The similarity in the optical changes observed and those for the first oxidation step of [Ru(biq)2bbhq]+ in potential controlled experiments suggested that the optical changes may be associated with the redox changes in the hydroquinone ligand. However, although the ILCT appears to be lost with significant blue shifts to the MLCT no features

associated with the sshq are observed so ligand loss remains the most likely mechanism. The photoproducts formed from this photoreaction will be investigated in the future. Nonetheless, the photoability of the biquinoline complex, by comparison with the bpy based complexes, is attributed to the weak r-donor ability of the biquinoline, which offsets the ability of the O¿ r-donor to split the ligand field for [Ru(biq)2bbhq]+. 11. Conclusion The spectroscopy and electrochemistry of a series of novel Ru(II) and Os(II) polypyridyl complexes O,N coordinated to hydroquinone ligand, bis-2,5-(2-benzoxazolyl)hydroquinone were investigated. In each instance the lowest energy singlet transition originates from the hydroquinone as a bbhq (p)≠LL (p*), interligand charge transfer transition. Consistently, the first oxidation process is localised on the bbhq ligand, which results in the formation of a semiquinone state which exhibits remarkable stability towards disproportionation, reflected in Kc(sq)s in excess of 109. The order of stability of the semiquinone is [Os(bpy)2bbhq]+ ) [Ru(biq)2bbhq]+ > [Ru(bpy)2bbhq]+. Clearly metal≠ligand orbital and the p-acceptor ability of metal and ligand facilitate this stability. Changing the identity of the metal and ancillary ligand does not affect the sequence of the electrochemical steps as bbhq is oxidised to its quinone state regardless of the presence of Ru/Os or bpy/biq. However, changing the ancillary ligand has a profound affect on the spectroscopic properties with the introduction of a stronger p-accepting ligand (biq) resulting in charge transfers that extend well into the near IR spectral region. The identity of metal and counter ligand also impacts the photostability of the metal complexes. Both the M(bpy)2 containing complexes exhibit good photostability, but the [Ru(biq)2(bbhq)]+ complex is photolabile.
