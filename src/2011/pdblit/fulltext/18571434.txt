Abstract Kinases of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, including extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), represent likely targets for pharmacological intervention in proliferative diseases. Here, we report that FR148083 inhibits ERK2 enzyme activity and TGFb-induced AP-1-dependent luciferase expression with respective IC50 values of 0.08 and 0.05 lM. FR265083 (1 0 ­2 0 dihydro form) and FR263574 (1 0 ­2 0 and 7 0 ­8 0 tetrahydro form) exhibited 5.5-fold less and no activity, respectively, indicating that both the a,bunsaturated ketone and the conformation of the lactone ring contribute to this inhibitory activity. The X-ray crystal structure of the ERK2/FR148083 complex revealed that the compound binds to the ATP binding site of ERK2, involving a covalent bond to Sc of ERK2 Cys166, hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH of Met108, Nf of Lys114, backbone C=O of Ser153, Nd2 of Asn154, and hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of Ile31, Val39, Ala52, and Leu156. The covalent bond motif in the ERK2/FR148083 complex assures that the inhibitor has high activity for ERK2 and no activity for other MAPKs such as JNK1 and p38MAPKa/b/c/d which have leucine residues at the site corresponding to Cys166 in ERK2. On the other hand, MEK1 and MKK7, kinases of the MAPKK family which also can be inhibited by FR148083, contain a cysteine residue corresponding to Cys166 of ERK2. The covalent binding to the common cysteine residue in the ATP-binding site is therefore likely to play a crucial role in the inhibitory activity for these MAP kinases. These findings on the molecular recognition mechanisms of FR148083 for kinases with Cys166 should provide a novel strategy for the pharmacological intervention of MAPK cascades. Ó 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are activated by a variety of external stimuli, and regulate the activation level of transcription factors, including activating protein (AP)-1 [1,2]. AP-1, which consists of the family protein of Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) and Jun (cJun, JunB, and JunD) heterodimers or Jun­Jun homodimers [2], mediates basal and stimulus-activated gene expression, and regulates a variety of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and death. The requirement of AP-1-dependent gene expression for tumor

promotion has been suggested in mouse and human experimental models [2]. The importance of AP-1 in tumor promotion has also been demonstrated using c-fos knockout mice and TAM67, a dominant-negative mutant form of the c-Jun protein, which blocks AP-1 activation [2]. ERK, a serine/threonine kinase of the MAPK superfamily, is located at the exit of the ERK signaling pathway, and is activated by phosphorylation of tyrosine and threonine residues by the upstream kinases MEK1 and MEK2. Activated ERK translocates to the nucleus to phosphorylate, and thereby activate, the ternary complex factor, a transcription factor that binds to the fos promoter, with the resultant induction of AP-1.

M. Ohori et al. / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 353 (2007) 633­637 Human ERK2 protein purification. Human ERK2 protein for X-ray crystallization was prepared as described previously [3]. In brief, Escherichia coli DH5a cells were transformed with pGEXERK2, cultured in 100 ml of LB media containing 100 lg/ml of ampicillin at 37 °C on a shaker for 12 h, and then transferred to 2 L of LB media and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The protein was induced with 0.75 mM of isopropyl-1-thio-bD-galactopyranoside at 22 °C for 4 h. The extracted supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione­Sepharose 4B resin and mixed for 1 h. The column was washed with five volumes of cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris­ HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Tween 20). The GST-tagged ERK2 protein was digested with 8% of PreScission protease in cleavage buffer for 4 h at 4 °C. ERK2 without the tag was eluted with PBS containing 5 mM dithiothreitol. ERK2 was further purified using a Mono Q 5/50 column (Amersham Biosciences) with a linear salt gradient of 0­1 M NaCl in 30 column volumes of MonoQ buffer (25 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM dithiothreitol), and size exclusion chromatography was performed on a Superdex HR200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in Superdex buffer (25 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM dithiothreitol) at 4 °C using an AKTA explorer system (Amersham Biosciences). X-ray crystallography. Cocrystals of human ERK2 with FR148083 were obtained using previous procedures [4]. In this study, 100 mM Bis­ Tris (pH 6.5), 0.2 M ammonium sulphate, and 30% (w/v) PEG5000 monomethyether were used as reservoir solution. The crystals were dipped into Paratone-N (Hampton Research) as a cryoprotectant and the intensity data set was collected at 100 K on a Rigaku R-AXIS V imaging-plate system at SPring-8 beamline BL32B2. The data were integrated and scaled with the program Crystal Clear (RIGAKU, Japan). The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using the program AMoRe [5] and the 1TVO structure [4] as a search probe. The program Quanta (Accelrys, CA) was used for model building and CNX (Accelrys, CA) for structure refinement. Data collection and refinement statistics of the complex are shown in Table 1. For the final coordinates deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the code 2E14, 18 amino acids from the N-terminus, including the GDLGSDEL sequence occurring due to recombi-

the MAPK cascades and tumor promotion, ERK represents a likely target for pharmacological intervention in proliferative diseases [2]. In this study, we report that FR148083 and derivatives containing the a,b-unsaturated ketone inhibit ERK and subsequent AP-1 activation. To better understand the molecular recognition mechanism of FR148083, we also performed an X-ray crystal structure analysis of human ERK2/FR148083 complex. Methods

PreScission protease, glutathione­Sepharose 4B, and pGEX-6P-1 were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate was purchased from Pierce Biotechnology (Rockford, IL). FR148083 (radicicol-related macrocyclic nonaketide compounds) and its derivatives were prepared in Astellas Pharma Inc. (Tsukuba, Japan). Kinase assay. Enzyme assay was performed as previously described [3]. In brief, Nunc-Immuno MaxiSorp plates (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) were coated with 20 lg/ml of MBP solution in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (T-PBS), blocking buffer (T-PBS containing 3% BSA) was added to each well, and then incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After washing with T-PBS, chemical compounds, ATP, and recombinant human kinases diluted in assay dilution buffer (20 mM Mops, pH 7.2, 25 mM b-glycerol phosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 lg/ml BSA) were added to each well. Vehicle groups (containing 0.1% DMSO) and kinase-withdrawal groups were used for the control and basal determinations. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, plates were washed twice with T-PBS. Anti-phospho MBP antibody (0.2 lg/ml) was added, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, anti-mouse HRP-conjugated polyclonal antibodies were added and incubated for 30 min. TMB reagent was used for the measurement of HRP activity according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for the IC50 determination. Cell culture. Mink Mv1Lu cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; DaiNippon, Osaka, Japan), 50 lg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 100 lM of nonessential amino acids, and 1 mM of sodium pyruvate. Luciferase assay. Luciferase assay was performed as described previously [3]. In brief, Mv1Lu cells were suspended with 400 ll of opti-MEM I containing pAP-1luc (40 lg) and phRL-TK (1 lg), and transferred into an electroporation-cuvette with a 0.4-cm gap (Equibio, Monchelsea, UK). The cuvette was shocked with an electrical discharge of 270 V/cm and 1.2 mF in an Easyject Plus electroporator (Equibio). The transfected Mv1Lu cells were plated on 96-well plates at a density of 1 · 105 cells/well. Inhibitors were added and incubated for 30 min, and then followed by the addition of TGFb or control medium. After 18 h incubation, luciferase activity was measured with a dual-luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Results and discussion Inhibitory activity of FR148083 and derivatives for ERK To discover potent inhibitors for human ERK2, we conducted an enzyme assay screening using recombinant human ERK2 protein for compounds isolated from a fermentation culture broth. This resulted in the identification of FR148083, an antibiotic reagent also referred to as LLZ1640-2, which inhibited ERK2 with an IC50 value of 0.08 lM (Fig. 1a and b). To date, the inhibitory activity of FR148083 for ERK has not reported. However, the 1 0 ­2 0 dihydro derivative FR265082 exhibited 5.5-fold less activity than FR148083, while FR263574, a tetrahydro derivative at the 1 0 ­2 0 and 7 0 ­8 0 positions, showed no inhibitory activity for ERK2 (Fig. 2b). The bonds at 1 0 ­2 0 and 7 0 ­8 0 associate the conformation of the 14-membered lactone ring and would make somehow contribution to the inhibition. Further, another derivative, FR264744, whose hydroxyl groups at 4 0 and 5 0 are blocked by a hydrophobic and bulky group, exhibited substantially (15-fold) lower activity than FR148083, indicating that these hydroxyl groups also serve for molecular interaction with ERK2. Intervention of TGFb-induced AP-1 activation TGFb is an inflammatory cytokine that promotes the invasiveness and metastatic behavior of cancer cells, and regulates their proliferation [6,7]. Further, it also activates transcription factor AP-1 through the ERK and JNK pathways [8]. To assess the inhibitory activity of FR148083 on AP-1 activation, we measured TGFb-induced luciferase expression, on the basis that this expression is controlled by a TPA-responsive sequence, which is also a cis-transcriptional element for AP-1. Luciferase activity was 11-

fold increased by TGFb, and inhibited by FR148083 in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.05 lM (Fig. 1c). This inhibition did not affect the expression of an internal control gene, renilla luciferase, which is regulated by a constitutively active promoter derived from herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene, suggesting that this inhibition resulted from the inhibition of TGFb signaling rather than any cytotoxicity or direct inhibition of transcription machinery (data not shown). IC50 values for AP-1 activation by the derivatives appeared to correlate with values in the ERK enzyme assay. FR265082 and FR264744 suppressed AP-1-dependent luciferase expression more moderately than FR148083 (Fig. 2a), while FR263574, which had no inhibitory activity on ERK2, failed to attenuate the expression. Furthermore, we previously showed that the ERK-specific inhibitor FR180204 suppressed TGFb signaling in mink lung epithelial Mv1Lu cells [3]. These results suggest that ERK inhibition contributes to the suppression of TGFbinduced AP-1 activation. Crystal structure reveals selectivity of FR148083 among MAP kinases The FR148083 molecule was bound to the ATP-binding site of ERK2 with a covalent bond, four hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions (Fig. 2b). Sc of Cys166 located at the ATP-binding site covalently bound to the b-carbon in the a,b-unsaturated ketone moiety of the inhibitor as judged by the continuous electron density map between the two concerned atoms (Fig. 2b). The a,b-unsaturated ketone moiety is likely to play a crucial role in binding to ERK, on the basis that the a,b-saturated ketone derivative FR263574 shows no inhibitory activity for the enzyme although 1 0 ­2 0 saturated derivative FR265082 has some inhibitory activity. A similar covalent bond had been observed in the complex between the cysteine residue in the substrate-binding region of the IjB kinase and cyclopentenone compound and its deduced

derivative at a,b-unsaturated ketone moiety has no inhibitory activity [9]. The covalent bond motif in the ERK2/ FR148083 complex should also assure that the inhibitor has high activity for ERK1/2 and no activity for the other MAP kinases, including JNK1/2 and p38MAPKa/b/c/d which have leucine residues at the corresponding site to Cys166 in ERK2 (Fig. 3a). The leucine residue cannot form covalent bonds with the unsaturated motif but might give rise to a steric crush with the motif.

The inhibitor forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH of Met108, Nf of Lys114, backbone C=O of Ser153, and Nd2 of Asn154. The hydrophobic residues containing Ile31, Val39, Ala52, and Leu156 interact with the FR148083 molecule from both faces of its ring structure. Chemical modification of FR148083 suggests that these hydrophilic and van der Waals interactions are not critical to but are rather significant for molecular recognition.

hydroxyl groups of FR148083 is unable to form a hydrogen bond to Ser153 and as a result revealed 15-fold less inhibitory activity for ERK. FR148083 exhibits Cys166-dependent inhibition of kinases To determine the selectivity of FR148083 for other kinases, recombinant enzyme assays were performed. FR148083 failed to inhibit human recombinant kinases including JNK1, p38a, p38b, p38c, p38d, MKK4, and IKKb up to 10 lM (MKK4, >3 lM). However, it did show inhibitory activity against MEK1 and MKK7, which are the upstream kinases of ERK and JNK, with IC50 values of 6 nM and 0.3 lM, respectively (Fig. 3b). It had been reported that FR148083 suppressed the phosphorylation of JNK induced by chemical stress [10­12]. Our findings suggest that FR148083 attenuates the phosphorylation of JNK via the inhibition of MKK7. FR148083 activity for MEK1 and MKK7, as well as for ERK, would also contribute to the inhibition for TGFb-induced AP-1 activation in Mv1Lu cells. The cooperative intervention of FR148083 in the ERK and JNK pathways would lead to the potent and effective suppression of AP-1 activation by various stimuli. In conclusion, we have found that FR148083 forms a covalent bond with Sc of Cys166, forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH of Met108, Nf of Lys114, backbone C=O of Ser153, Nd2 of Asn154, and forms hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of Ile31, Val39, Ala52, and Leu156 in the complex. These interactions manifest the qualitative structure-activity tendency of FR148083 and its derivatives. The other kinase targets of FR148083 also have cysteine residues corresponding to the Cys166 of ERK2. Covalent binding to the common cysteine residue in the ATP-binding site is likely to play a crucial role in inhibitory activity against these MAP kinases. However, because FR148083 does not inhibit MKK4, even though this kinase also possesses a cysteine residue in the ATPbinding site, we have not neglected the other structural elements in drug design process, with the exception of a covalent-binding moiety with the SH group. The pharmacological intervention of kinases in MAPK cascades by

FR148083 and other cysteine-binders with an appropriate moiety should provide a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of proliferative diseases. Acknowledgments The authors thank Drs. Toshiaki Katada and Kenji Kontani for their helpful advice. References
