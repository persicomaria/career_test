vivo, and are very similar if not identical in their physical properties. It has been shown by physical methods that EI undergoes a monomer/dimer transition (Kukuruzinska et al., 1982, 1984). Labelling experiments with 32p-PEP show that only the dimer can be phosphorylated by PEP (see below). This suggests that the M/D transition is the key to understanding EI regulation, and as a consequence, the key to how the PTS regulates sugar transport and the many other functions in which it participates. For purposes of the discussion that follows, the simplest schematic model (Waygood et al., 1979) for this h y p o t h e s i s is i l l u s t r a t e d in figure 1. The monomer associates to the dimer, which accepts the phosphoryl group from PEP, and dissociates to phospho-monomer. The pbospho-monomer transfers the phosphoryl group to HPr, regenerating d e p h o s p h o - m o n o m e r , t h e r e b y c o m p l e t i n g the cycle.

Phosphory|ation of El/zyme I There are four known mechanisms for phosphorylating El (fig. 2). PEP autophosphorylates El, and El accepts a phosphoryl group from three proteins, phospho-HPr, phospho-acetokinase and a recently described ATP-dcpendent kinasc. The reversible transfer of phosphate between E1 and acetate kinase, or AK, has been proposed (Fox et at., 1986) to link the PTS to the Krebs cycle. The reaction sequence proceeds as follows: ATP tot"GrIP or actqyI-P)+AK~--ADP (or GDP or Ac-)+P-AK

P r i m a r y a m i n o acid sequences The ptsl genes have been cloned and s e q u e n c e d f r o m E. coli ( S a f f e n et al., 1 9 8 7 ; Postma et al., 1993) and S. typhimurium (LiCalsi et al., 1991), a n d t h e d e d u c e d a m i n o a c i d sequences predict monomer molecular masses of 63.5 and 63.2 kDa for the respective proteins. W i t h i n e x p e r i m e n t a l error, t h e s e v a l u e s agree with molecular weights of the isolated proteins (monomers) determined by various methods. Furthermore, the protein is not processed in vivo, since the N-terminal amino acid sequence and the C-terminus (Cys) agree with the predicted s e q u e n c e s . The N-terminal a m i n o acid studies (Weigel et al., 1982b) also showed that the EI dimer is composed of identical subunits. The active site His residue is amino acid 189, and the protein contains two Trp and four Cys. These amino acids are of particular importance for what follows.

The phosphoryl group in P-El is linked to the active site His and in P-AK, is linked to a T-glutamyl carboxyl (Todhunter and Purich, 1974).

t.'..c nevel kinase is specific for ATP. But even more interestingly, E1 kinase contains an unknown c o f a c t o r t h a t c a n be r e p l a c e d by N A D + or NADP +. At all stages of purification, the kinase is inhibited by NADH or NADPH, and the activity o f t h e e n z y m e is r e g u l a t e d b y t h e ratio NAD÷/NADH, leading to the suggestion that this kinase links the PTS to the electron transport chain. The autophosphorylation of El by PEP in the presence of Mg 2+ has been extensively studied and is the subject of the remainder of this review, Two phosphoryl groups are accepted per protein dimer, and the phosphoryl group is linked at the N-3 position (Weigei et al., 1982a) of a His moiety (residue 189). El is fully active between pH 6.5-8.0, and equilibrium studies over this range gave an apparent K'eq = 1.5 for the reaction (in 4 m M Mg2+): PEP + Enzyme I ~ Pyruvate + Phospho-EI. It should be emphasized that PEP has the highest phosphotransfer potential of all natural phosphoryl derivatives (14.7 kCal/mol). The K ' ~ studies (Weigel et al., 1982a) indicate that this potential (about twice that of ATP) is retained by phospho-El. In fact, similar studies with the other proteins show that the phosphotransfer potential is retained as the phosphate passes from PEP to E1 to HPr to II1°tc (llA°lC). The large drop in free energy (about 1 ! kCal) that occurs in the overall transfer from PEP to sugar takes place somewhere between P-Ill (or P-IIA) and the sugar which is being transloeated. In vivo, this high phosphotransfer potential may ensure that regulation through p h o s p h o t r a n s f e r occurs f r o m the P T S proteins to their targets, and not in the opposite direction. These studies also demonstrated that Mg 2÷ is required for El to accept phosphate from PEP, but is not required for the transfer from P-El to HPr.

The properties of the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains of S. typhimurium El were studied with the aid of proteolytic digestion. Treatment of El with three different proteases gave the same results. The N-terminal, or t h e r m o d y n a m i c a l l y more stable domain is very resistant to proteolysis under conditions where the C-terminal domain is sensitive. These properties permitted isolation of the N-terminal d o m a i n . T r y p s i n digestion w a s u~ed, and the resistant fragment was isolated and characterized (El-N). The molecular size of EI-N is about half of the El monomer, and was estimated by Ferguson F~ots of SDS-PAGE gels to be about 30 kDa (-+ 10%). Based on the amino acid sequence and the specificities of the three proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, and V8 protease), the carboxyl termini of the three different EI-N fragments was predicted to lie between Lys-250 and Asp-305. In a recent paper (Lee et al., 1994), these experiments were repeated, except that E. coli E1 was used, and in addition, the N-terminal domain was s u b j e c t e d to e l e c t r o s p r a y m a s s s p e c t r o m e t r y . According to these results, the C-terminal amino acids were lysine 255 (trypsin). leucine 264 (chymotrypsin), ,and glutamate 252 (V8 protease). We have recently cloned and overproduced the E. coil N-terminal domain (Chanvin et al., 1996). EI-N does not accept a phosphoryl group from PEP, but reversibly accepts the phosphoryl group from P-HPr (LiCalsi et al., 1991). Preliminary gel f i l t r a t i o n s t u d i e s s u g g e s t that EI-N d o e s not dimerize. It may lack a PEP binding site, while it retains an HPr (P-HPr) binding site. These results are consistent with the monomer/dimer model in figure 1. Calorimetric studies of intact EI reveal that both domains of EI interact, and the strength/~f the interaction varies with the conditions, The pH was vz~rled over the pH range, 6.5-8.5, in which the enzyme is fully active. At pH 6.5, the two domains unfold in a c o o p e r a t i v e m a n n e r , a n d a s i n g l e T~, is observed (54°C). As the pH is increased, the profile ( e x c e s s heat capacity v e r s u s temperature) changes to two peaks that are almost completely separated at pH 7.5. However, the stability of the isolated N-terminal domain is higher than when it is part of the whole protein (LiCalsi et al., 1991). A schematic diagram of the two domains in El monomer is presented in figure 3. The results of protease digestion studies suggest that the N-terminal domain is relatively rigid and compact. The C-terminal domain is depicted as a flexible polypeptide. Figure 3 also gives the positions of the relevant a m i n o acids, the active site His ( N - t e r m i n a l domain), and the two Trp and four Cys residues (Ctcrmii~al domain).

Structural and thermodynamic domains
Important properties o f El were revealed by experiments on its thermal stability using high sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry (LiCalsi et al., 1991). Thermal unfolding of the protein at pH 7.5 exhibited two peaks, with maxima (Tin) at 47.6 and 55.1°C, and these were found to correspond to the C-terminal and N-terminal domains, respectively. After u n f o l d i n g o f the C-terminal domain, enzymatic activity (sugar phosphate formation) can be observed, and there is no change in behaviour of E1 on a non-denaturing PAGE gel (it does not aggregate). As the N-terminal domain begins to unfold, however, activity is irreversibly lost and the electrophoretic behaviour is that of a denatured protein,

Conformational changes in E1 ; reactivity o f - S H groups The flexibility of the C-terminal domain was dramatically illustrated (Han et al., 1990) by kinetic studies on the reaction of the four Cys - S H groups with DTNB (5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid). As each sulphydryl group reacts with the reagent, one mol of TNB- is liberated, and the rate of the reaction can be followed spectrophotometrically at 412 nm. Figure 4 illustrates the rate of T N B - formation when E1 is treated with DTNB at pH 7.5, room temperature, in the presence and absence of different ligands. The figure shows that: i) under all conditions tested, there is one very reactive or " f a s t " - S H that combines with the DTNB at about 10 times the rate of the three "slow" - S H g r o u p s ; ii) when ligands are present, there is a slight change in the reaction rate of the fast - S H , but as much as a 10f~ld change in the rates of the slow - S H groups. The rate is increased with HPr, decreased with Mg 2+, unchanged with PEP alone, and is slowest in the presence of Mg 2+ and PEP (when the enzyme is phosphorylated). The fast - S H was characterized as the Cys residue located at the C - t e r m i n u s o f the protein. Because it reacts so rapidly, El can be selectively

derivatized with fluorophores such as pyrene, and these derivatives retain full e n z y m a t i c activity. When the other Cys - S H groups are derivatized, the e n z y m e loses activity and no longer dimerizes. These properties were taken advantage of in the preparation of pyrene-labelled EI (see below). Dimerization could occur through a number of mechanisms. Figure 5 shows two possibilities: the contact between subunits in the dimer takes place either at the N-terminal domain (top) or at the C-terminal domain (bottom). We favour the latter hypothesis because of the following lines o f evidence: i) the isolated N-terminal domain is phosphorylated by phospho-HPr but not by PEP (we know that PEP can phosphorylate only the dimer); ii) preliminary gel filtration experiments suggest that the Nqerminal fragment does not dimerize; iii) if the internal Cys residues (part of the C-terminal domain) are derivatized with - S H reagents, the protein cannot dimerize" iv) kinetic experiments (see below) suggest a conformationai change upon dimerization; the more flexible C-terminal d o m a i n appears more likely to undergo such a modification, especially in light of the changes in its thermodynamic properties when the pH changes; v) time-resolved tryptophan fluorescence experiments indicate that the environment of the Trp residues is different in M and D; the two Trps are located in the C-terminal domain.

A conformational change is shown in both cases because of the slow rate of M/D interconversion. short decay time of tryptophan, especially in relation to the longer rotational correlation time of the dimer. Several methods have been used to determine the enthalpic and entropic contributions to the transition. Analytical gel permeation chromatography gave the following values (Kukuruzinska et al., 1984): AH = 5 4 . 8 ± 6 kcal.mol -I and AS = 2 2 0 ± 2 2 cal.mol-l.deg -1. The Van't Hoff plot obtained by measuring the intrinsic fluorescence anisotropy of the Trp residues (Neyroz et al., 1987) yielded: AI1 = 70 kcal.mo1-1 and AS = 276 cal.mol-l.deg -n. The more recent (and probably more accurate) values obtained with p.crene-labelled El (Chauvin et al., 1994a) gave the following results: dephospho-El in the absence of ligand, AH = 21 kcal.mol -n and AS = 98 cal.mol -~.deg -I. The values obtained by the different methods (each obtained under different conditions) all show that the association is entropically driven. The most significant information on the MID transition has come from studies with the pyrenelabelled protein. Pyrene was selected as the fluorescence probe of choice because of its long decay time as compared to tryptophan, and a homogeneous conjugate labelled only at the C-terminal suiphydryl was used for all experiments. It is important to empr,lasize that the properties of the labelled and the native protein were indistinguishable both in terms of activity and in terms of the MID equilibrium (Chauvin et al., 1994a). The fluorescence anisotropy of pyrene-labelled E1 was used to determine K" of the M/D transi· tlOnS for phospho- and dephospho-El, m the presence or absence of ligands. The results can be summarized as follows: i) at constant temperature (23°C), changes in ligand concentrations and phosphorylation state cause K' eq to vary by 240-fold"· .. . , n) regardless of the presence of hgands, K ~ for dephospho-enzyme was 6-12-fold greater t h ~ for phospho-EI ; iii) Mg ++ increases K" eo 7-8-fold for both phospho- and dephospho-proteihs; iv) when the pH is varied from 6.5 to 7.5. there is little effect on K' eq in the presence of Mg ++' both for phospho, and dephospho-enzyme; v) the largest effect on K _ was observed when 2 mM PEP was added to th'~ phosphoenzyme in the presence o f Mg++, PEP increases K'eq 30-fold.

with results obtained by proteolysis of E1 (LiCalsi et al., 1991). That is, the C-terminal domain is digested more quickly at pH 7.5 than at 6.5. Perhaps the most interesting results that came out o f these studies ( C h a u v i n et al., 1994b) were the k i n e t i c s o f the M I D t r a n s i t i o n . " C o n c e n t r a t i o n j u m p s " o f El were used to perturb the equilibrium, and the rates of association and dissociation of the pyrene-labelled protein were followed (2L The rates of the M/D transition are very slow : for example, d i s s o c i a t i o n r e q u i r e s one hour for c o m p l e t i o n at 6°C, and 15 rain at 23°C. The "at:parent" kinetic constants were determined assuming (i) that relaxation occurs in a single step and (ii) a small perturbation was applied. For phospho-E[ in the presence of M g ++ and P E P a t 6°C: k* A = 3.4 × 103 M - I . s e c - L k* o = 1.04 x 10 -3 see -I. T h e s e v a l u e s are l o w e r

than most published values for other protein monomer/dimer transitions. The k* A for El is 2 to 3 orders c f magnitude lower than the rates determined for most proteins. If the c o r r e l a t i o n presented a b o v e b e t w e e n E1 association state and its enzymatic activity is correct, then El should lose activity upon dissociation. This was observed, and the ki;zetics of activity loss and anisotropy decrease are identical (fig. 6). To rigorously validate the results and interpretations of the e x p e r i m e n t s with the p y r e n e - l a b e l l e d protein, a second set of expe.riments (Chauvin et al., 1992) w a s p e r f o r m e d u s i n g n a n o s e c o n d t i m e r e s o l v e d f l u o r e s c e n c e i n t e n s i t y o f t r y p t o p h a n to measure the rate o f native E1 dissociation.

A global analysis procedure was used to extract the relaxation time for the El dissociation, and the conclusions were the same as those obtained with the pyrene-labelled protein using the steadystate anisotropy measurements, All of the results summarized above suggest the following hypothesis: the slow change in quartenary structure (dimer dissociation) occurs in conjunction

t2) AS indicated in this review, changes in temperature between 0-37°C have large effects on the M/D transition. Temperature changes could have marked effects on the conformation of the C-terminal domain. In studying the MID transition, it was important to avoid temperature-induced eonformational changes. and this, therefore, was the reason for using concentration changes as the major method for perturbing the equilibria.

with a change in conformation of the monomer, perhaps even preceded by this change. The conformational alterations in tertiary and quaternary structures cause a switch between enzymatically active and inactive forms. The pivotal point that comes from these studies is that the association/dissociation reactions of El and phospbo-El monomer/dimer are very slow relative to the enzymatic reaction. Preliminary results show that the rate of phosphotransfer between PTS proteins (HPr and III C~c for example) is 3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of the M/D transition (N. Meadow, unpublished data), if the rates of the M/D transition can be controlled by "regulators" in the cell, they would in turn control the rate of sugar transport and of all other processes in which the PTS participates. Efforts are ur,_-2er way to identify the hypothetical regulator~. Finally, it should be emphasized that we do not know whether the monomer or dimer or both are phosphorylated by acetate kinase and the NAD ÷ d e p e n d e n t E1 k i n a s e d e s c r i b e d above. If these kinases should, for example, phosphorylate only the monomer (which rapidly transfers the phosphoryl group to HPr), this would be a means for the cell to avoid the slow kinetics of the M/D transition. One could envision physiological circumstances where rapid pnosphorylation or dephosphorylation of El may be essential for regulating cell physiology. It is also possible that the M/D transition does not take place at every catalytic cycle. Rather, there is an initial "activation step" that switches the conformation of El from inactive to active, and this conformation is retained as long as the enzyme is catalysing phosphorylation of HPr or of the kinases with which it interacts.

Cyclic AMP and catabolite repression

Catabolite repression is the mechanism by which glucose or another rapidly metabolized carbohydrate exerts a continued inhibition of catabolic enzyme synthesis (Magasanik, 1961). Catabolite repression has been studied extensively in enteric bacteria, particularly in the ease of the lactose operon and its product I~-galactosidase. In general, growth on a carbon source supporting slow growth results in a higher level of [3-galactosidase (Magasanik and Neidhardt, 1987). When glucose is used as the source of carbon and energy, the differential rate of synthesis of [~-galactosidase is strongly reduced. Catabolite repression is currently believed to be partly related to variations in the intracellular adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) concentration (Ullmann and Monod, 1968; Perlman et al., 1969; Epstein et al., 1975), This is due to the fact that initiation of transcription at the promoters of catabolite-sensitive operons requires cAMP and CAP (catabolite activator protein; Zubay et al., Received February 26, 1996,

1970), also called CRP (cyclic AMP receptor protein; Emmet et al., 1970). When complexed with cAMP, CRP binds with variable affinities to specific sites upstream of promoters of catabolite-sensitive operons, activating their transcription (Kolb et al., 1993). Accordingly, in cya strains lacking adenylate cyclase, the expression of catabolite-sensitive operons is dramatically reduced and can be restored to a certain level by addition of cAMP. in Escherichia coil, the intracellular cAMP concentrations vary with the carbon and energy source used by the cell. Furthermore, there is a correlation with the differential rate of synthesis of [~-galactosidase (Epstein et al., 1975; Joseph et al., 1982). In the case of glucose, a model for the regulatior of the cAMP level has been proposed which involves the phosphotransferase system (Kundig et al., 1964; Postma et al., 1993; Saier and Reizer, 1994).
