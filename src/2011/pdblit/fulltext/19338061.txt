INTRODUCTION Red blood cell protein 4.1 (4.1R, an 80 kDa isoform),1 one of the major erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins, forms two major ternary complexes in red blood cells, 4.1Ractin-spectrin and 4.1R-p55-glycophorin C (GPC), and plays important roles in maintaining cell morphology and membrane mechanical properties.1­7 This protein consists of four functional domains: the FERM (4.1 and ezrin/radixin/moesin)8 domain (also termed the N-terminal 30 kDa membrane-binding domain), the 16 kDa regulatory domain, the spectrin-actin-binding (SAB) domain, and the C-terminal 22/24 kDa domain. The 4.1R FERM domain is a multifunctional domain that forms a cloverleaf-like fold containing three structural and functional domains (N-lobe, a-lobe, and C-lobe domains).9 In the 4.1R-p55-GPC ternary complex, the 4.1R FERM a-lobe domain interacts with the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GPC, the 4.1R FERM C-lobe10 and/or N-lobe domain11 interacts with the p55 HOOK domain, and the p55 PDZ domain interacts with the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GPC.10,12­14 We previously examined the specific binary interaction between the p55 PDZ domain and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GPC by NMR, as the first step to obtain structural insights into the 4.1R-p55-GPC ternary complex.15,16 Our NMR studies clearly revealed how the p55 PDZ domain interacts with two key C-terminal residues, Tyr126 and Ile128, of GPC at the atomic level.16 We have now focused on the binary interaction between

the 4.1R FERM a-lobe domain and the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GPC, as the second step toward our goal. In the binary interaction between 4.1R and GPC, the 4.1R-binding site on GPC reportedly corresponds to the Nterminal 12 amino acid residues of its cytoplasmic domain (residues 82­93), and the RHK (residues Arg86-His87Lys88) motif is probably crucial for binding the 4.1R FERM a-lobe domain.13 In contrast, the GPC-binding site on the 4.1R FERM domain reportedly corresponds to the sequence encoded by exon 8 (residues Tyr94-Arg166) in the 4.1R alobe domain, and the ELEE motif (residues Glu153Glu156) is considered to be a good candidate for the GPC-binding site.9,10 However, there is no experimental evidence that the ELEE motif contributes to the interaction with the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GPC. To better understand this interaction mode, we prepared the 4.1R FERM a-lobe domain (residues Asp83-Tyr187) and performed an NMR analysis of this domain with the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GPC. Here, we report the first NMR-derived structure of the 4.1R FERM a-lobe domain and propose a new GPC-binding site on the 4.1R FERM a-lobe domain, based on our NMR experiments.

METHODS
Sample preparation

The DNA encoding the a-lobe domain of the human erythroid protein 4.1R FERM domain (105 amino acid residues, residues 83­187, hereafter, referred to as the 4.1R a-lobe domain) was amplified from a human universal cDNA library (Clontech). The resulting PCR product was cloned into pET-15b vector (Novagen). The 4.1R a-lobe domain was expressed in Escherichia coli strain Rosetta (DE3), as a hexahistidine-tagged protein (His6tag protein). Uniformly 15N-, 13C/15N- and 10% 13C/15Nlabeled proteins were prepared by expressing the protein 15 in M9 minimal media containing NH4Cl, 15 13 15 13 NH4Cl/ C6-D-glucose, or 10% NH4Cl/ C6-D-glucose, as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. The His6-tag protein was purified by chromatography on either a TALON superflow (Clontech) or a COSMOGEL (Nacalai Tesque) column, and then was cleaved with thrombin at 48C. The resulting recombinant protein contains four additional vector-derived amino acid residues (Gly-Ser-His-Met) at the N-terminus. These four residues were numbered from 79 to 82, in this study, for structure determination. The protein was then further purified using a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare). The DNA encoding the cytoplasmic domain of human glycophorin C (47 amino acid residues, residues 82­128, hereafter, referred to as GPC(82­128)) was amplified from a human universal cDNA library (Clontech). The resulting PCR product was cloned into pGEX-6P2 vector (GE Healthcare). GPC(82­128) was expressed in Escherichia coli strain Rosetta, as a GST fusion protein. The GST fusion protein was purified by a glutathione sepharose column (GE Healthcare), and then was cleaved with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare). The cleaved recombinant protein contains five additional vectorderived amino acid residues (Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ser) at the N-terminus. GPC(82­128) was then further purified using a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare). The 12 N-terminal residue (residues 82­93) and the 12 C-terminal residue (residues 117­128) GPC peptides, referred to as GPC(82­93) and GPC(117­128), respectively, were purchased from ANYGEN.

HN(CO)CA, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, C(CO)NH, H(CCO)NH, HCCH-TOCSY, (HB)CB(CGCD)HD, (HB)CB(CGCDCE)HE, TOCSY, NOESY, HNHA, HNHB, 15 N-edited NOESY-HSQC, and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC experiments. The stereospecific assignments of the methyl groups of leucine and valine were obtained from a 2D 1 H-13C CT-HSQC spectrum on a 10% 13C/15N-labeled protein sample.19 For the residual dipolar coupling (RDC) measurement, NMR samples in the absence and presence of 25 mg/mL Pf1 phage20 (Asla Labs) were prepared, respectively. This medium induced a deuterium splitting of about 23.4 Hz. The one bond NÀ ÀH couplings in the isotropic and anisotropic media were measured using 2D IPAP 1H-15N HSQC experiments.21 Proton chemical shifts were referenced directly to DSS at 0 ppm, and 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly to the absolute frequency ratios 15N/1H 5 0.101329118 and 13C/1H 5 0.251449530, respectively. All data were processed with Bruker Topspin version 1.3, and analyzed with SPARKY version 3.115.22

Structure calculation

NMR spectroscopy

The NMR samples contained 0.12 to 0.8 mM protein in 22.5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.4), 45 mM NaCl, 0.9 mM DTT, 0.67 mM DSS and either 90% H2O/10% D2O or 100% D2O. All NMR experiments were acquired on Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer equipped with 1 H/13C/15N cryogenic probe at 258C. Backbone and sidechain 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances were assigned using triple resonance NMR experiments17,18: 1H-15N HSQC, 1 H-13C CT-HSQC, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA,

CYANA version 2.1 was used for the collection of the distance restraints.23 Dihedral / and w angle restraints were determined from the chemical shift data, using the program TALOS.24 The v1 angle restraints were estimated from 13C0 -(13Cg) and 15N-(13Cg) spin-echo difference 1H-15N HSQC experiments.25 Hydrogen bond restraints were generated from the secondary structure of the protein, based on the backbone chemical shift data. Final structures were calculated by CNS version 1.1, with 1680 distance restraints, 163 dihedral angle restraints, and 64 1DNH values, by a simulated annealing protocol.26 The RDC values were obtained as the difference in couplings between the isotropic and anisotropic samples. The axial components of the molecular alignment tensor (Da) and the rhombicity (R) were estimated from the powder pattern distribution27 of the 64 1DNH values, ranging from 219.0 Hz to 14.6 Hz. The final values of Da and R were obtained from the results of the grid search: the resulting values of Da 5 29.5 Hz and R 5 0.36 yielded lower energy structures and were identical to the estimated values from the powder pattern distribution. From the 50 trial structures, the final 20 lowest energy structures with no distance violations greater than ° 0.2 A, no dihedral angle violations greater than 28, and no dipolar coupling greater than 2 Hz were selected. The final structures were analyzed with the programs PALES28 and PROCHECK-NMR.29 The coordinates and resonance assignments have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (Accession code 2RQ1) and the BioMagResBank (Accession number 11065). Structure figures were generated using the programs MOLMOL30 and PyMOL (http://pymol.sourceforge.net).

Solution Structure of the 4.1R FERM -Lobe Domain

Identification of the GPC-binding site of the 4.1R a-lobe domain

To identify the GPC-binding site of the 4.1R a-lobe domain, GPC(82­128) was added to $0.12 mM of either the 13C/15N- or 15N-labeled protein. The 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the protein with 0, 1, 5, and 10 equivalents of GPC(82­128) were recorded at 258C. The backbone assignments of the 4.1R a-lobe domain in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of GPC(82­128) were accomplished by HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HN(CO)CA, HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCACB experiments at 258C. The combined chemical shift perturbation was calculated using the following equation, qffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi Ddppm ¼ ðDdHN Þ2 þ ðDdN Ã aN Þ2 ð1Þ with a scaling factor (aN) of 0.17. To test whether the Nterminal region of GPC interacts with the 4.1R a-lobe domain, GPC(82­93) was added to $40 lM of the 15Nlabeled protein. The 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the protein with 0, 1, 5, and 10 equivalents of GPC(82­93) were recorded at 258C. To confirm that the C-terminal region of GPC does not interact with the 4.1R a-lobe domain, GPC(117­128) was used, and we performed the same experiment as that with GPC(82­93). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In this study, we selected the region of Asp83-Tyr187 as the 4.1R a-lobe domain, instead of the previously defined region (Tyr94-Arg166), because the construct of the previously defined region lacks a part of the N-terminal helix and the entire C-terminal helix of the 4.1R alobe domain, based on the crystal structure of the 4.1R FERM domain9 (PDB code 1GG3). To ascertain whether this domain retains the same fold as the a-lobe domain observed in the crystal structure of the 4.1R FERM domain, the 3D structure of this domain was determined on the basis of 1680 distance restraints, 163 dihedral angle restraints, and 64 1DNH dipolar coupling restraints. Figure 1(A) shows the 20 lowest energy structures, in which the backbone structure is well defined, with the exception of the eight N-terminal residues and a loop region consisting of residues 132­139. The average RMS ° differences in residues 87­184 were 0.50 A for the back0 ° bone (N, Ca, and C ) atoms and 1.06 A for all heavy atoms. The NMR structural statistics are summarized in Table I. The solution structure of the 4.1R a-lobe domain consists of four long a-helices, LH1 (87­105), LH2 (113­ 128), LH3 (152­163), LH4 (170­184), and a short helix, SH1 (140­143) [Fig. 1(B)], and is almost identical to that of the a-lobe domain in the crystal structure of the 4.1R FERM domain9 (PDB code 1GG3), with the exception of the N- and C-terminal regions and loops [Fig.

1(C)]. The differences of the N- and C-terminal regions between them seem to be affected by the neighboring subdomains, the N- and C-lobe domains [Fig. 1(C)], and are due to the existence of the four vector-derived amino acid residues before the a-lobe domain (residues 83­ 187), in our construct. The RMS differences between the 20 final NMR structures and the crystal structure range ° from 1.14 to 1.36 A for 87­91 equivalent Ca atoms (the ° average RMS difference is 1.23 Æ 0.06 A), and the RMS difference between the averaged NMR structure and the ° crystal structure is 1.23 A for 91 equivalent Ca atoms, as calculated by the program PyMOL. Thus, this overall structural similarity between them indicates that the 4.1R a-lobe domain prepared in this study retains the proper fold and seems to be suitable and useful for the identification of the GPC-binding site on this protein by NMR. To identify the GPC-binding site on the 4.1R a-lobe domain, we performed an NMR chemical shift perturbation experiment, by the addition of 1-fold, 5-fold, and 10-fold molar excesses of GPC.(82­128) Large chemical shift changes of the backbone amide resonances were observed upon GPC(82­128) binding. All of the resonances of the 4.1R a-lobe domain (residues 83­187) in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of GPC(82­128) were completely assigned, except for the five proline residues of this protein. The affected residues, Leu87-Asp90, Arg93, Cys97, Leu98, R101, Glu127, Leu128, His136, Gly137, Phe144, Gln172, and Asp174, were mainly located on one surface formed by helices LH1 and SH1 in this protein [Fig. 1(D)], suggesting that this surface of the 4.1R a-lobe domain is involved in the interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of GPC. Therefore, we refer to this surface as the GPC-binding surface. The 4.1R a-lobe domain reportedly interacts with the N-terminal region of GPC, but not the C-terminal region of GPC.10,13 To determine whether the 4.1R a-lobe domain specifically binds to the N-terminal region of GPC, we performed NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments, using GPC(82­93) and GPC(117­128). As expected, the residues affected upon GPC(82­93) binding were almost identical to those observed upon GPC(82­ 128)(82­128) binding, whereas no chemical shift changes were observed in the spectra of the 15N labeled 4.1R alobe domain with GPC(117­128)(data not shown). In our NMR experiments, large amounts of ligands were required to observe obvious chemical shift changes of the 4.1R a-lobe domain, and the interaction was on the fast exchange time scale, indicating that this may be a relatively low affinity interaction. Thus, the 4.1R a-lobe domain specifically interacts with the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GPC, containing the RHK motif, with low affinity. The 4.1R FERM domain reportedly interacts with not only GPC and p55 in the 4.1R-p55-GPC ternary complex17,18 but also other membrane proteins, such as band 3, CD44, XK, Duffy and Rh, via each lobe domain

of the 4.1R FERM domain.31­33 For example, it was recently revealed that the cytoplasmic domains of Duffy and XK bind to the 4.1R a-lobe domain, but not the other two lobes, by pull-down assay experiments.33 However, it has still been unclear whether those of Duffy and XK bind to the same binding site on the 4.1R a-lobe domain as that of GPC. We believe that our method used in this study will be able to answer this question in the future. In this study, we determined the solution structure of the 4.1R a-lobe domain, which retains the proper fold and is virtually the same as that in the crystal structure of the 4.1R FERM domain.9 In addition, the GPC-binding site on the 4.1R a-lobe domain was identified by

NMR experiments. Although the ELEE motif in the 4.1R a-lobe domain has been suggested as a good candidate for the GPC-binding site,9,10 the amide resonances of the ELEE motif showed smaller chemical shift changes upon binding the cytoplasmic domain of GPC, and the ELEE motif is on the opposite side of the putative GPCbinding surface identified in this study [Fig. 1(D)]. Thus, the putative GPC-binding surface, rather than the surface containing the ELEE motif, is likely to contribute to the binary interaction with the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of GPC. This is a novel finding regarding the binary interaction between the 4.1R a-lobe domain and the N-terminal region of GPC. Additional biochemical and structural studies will help to clarify the specific
