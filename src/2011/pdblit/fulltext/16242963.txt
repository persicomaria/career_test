3-Deoxy-D -arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) catalyzes the first reaction of the aromatic biosynthetic pathway in bacteria, fungi, and plants, the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and D -erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) with the formation of DAHP. Crystals of DAHPS from Thermotoga maritima (DAHPSTm) were grown in the presence of PEP and metal cofactor, Cd2þ, and then soaked with E4P at 4 8C where the catalytic activity of the enzyme is negligible. The crystal structure of ° the "frozen" reaction complex was determined at 2.2 A resolution. The subunit of the DAHPSTm homotetramer consists of an N-terminal ferredoxin-like (FL) domain and a (b/a)8-barrel domain. The active site located at the C-end of the barrel contains Cd2þ, PEP, and E4P, the latter bound in a non-productive conformation. The productive conformation of E4P is suggested and a catalytic mechanism of DAHPS is proposed. The active site of DAHPSTm is nearly identical to the active sites of the other two known DAHPS structures from Escherichia coli (DAHPSEc) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (DAHPSSc). However, the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of DAHPSTm are more similar to the functionally related enzyme, 3-deoxy-D -manno-octulosonate-8-phosphate synthase (KDOPS) from E. coli and Aquiflex aeolicus, than to DAHPSEc and DAHPSSc. Although DAHPSTm is feedback-regulated by tyrosine and phenylalanine, it lacks the extra barrel segments that are required for feedback inhibition in DAHPSEc and DAHPSSc. A sequence similarity search revealed that DAHPSs of phylogenetic family Ib possess a FL domain like DAHPSTm while those of family Ia have extra barrel segments similar to those of DAHPSEc and DAHPSSc. This indicates that the mechanism of feedback regulation in DAHPSTm and other family Ib enzymes is different from that of family Ia enzymes, most likely being mediated by the FL domain.

aromatic amino acids as well as other aromatic compounds of primary and secondary metabolism,1 the aldol-like condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and D -erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) with the formation of DAHP and phosphate. KDOPS catalyses the first step in the biosynthesis of a variety of cell surface components,2 an analogous condensation of PEP and D -arabinose-5-phosphate (A5P), which is one carbon atom longer than E4P, with the formation of KDOP and phosphate. Both reactions are stereospecific with the si face of C3 of PEP attacking the re face of the aldehyde of E4P/A5P. Both involve the release of the phosphate of PEP by cleavage of the C ­O rather than the O ­P bond.3 ­ 6 DAHPS is able to use A5P as a substrate, albeit poorly, while KDOPS is unable to utilize E4P.7 The activity of DAHPS depends on the presence of a divalent metal cofactor; whereas, both metal-dependent and metal-independent forms of KDOPS are known. The activity of DAHPS is commonly a target of negative feedback inhibition by one or more of the amino acid end products of the aromatic biosynthetic pathway or its intermediates. The activity of KDOPS is characteristically not subject to feedback regulation. Recent phylogenetic analyses by Jensen et al.8 ­ 10 and Woodard et al.11 have established the evolutionary relatedness of the DAHPS and KDOPS enzymes. The DAHPSs are divided into two distinct homology classes. Class I DAHPSs are all microbial in origin and are subdivided into two families, Ia and Ib (nomenclature by Jensen). The KDOPSs are distantly related to the DAHPs of family Ib, forming a separate subfamily. Class II DAHPSs consist of enzymes from higher plants together with a group of microbial enzymes that function mainly in pathways of secondary metabolism. There is no significant sequence similarity between the class II DAHPSs and the class I DAHPSs and KDOPSs. The crystal structures of two family Ia DAHPSs, the phenylalanine-regulated isozyme from Escherichia coli12 ­ 15 (DAHPSEc) and the tyrosineregulated isozyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae16,17 (DAHPSSc), and of the KDOPSs from E. coli18 ­ 20 (KDOPSEc) and Aquiflex aeolicus21 ­ 23 (KDOPSAa) have been solved in recent years. The four homologs are similar in structure, all being homotetramers composed of (b/a)8-barrel subunits with similar active sites. Nevertheless, there are notable differences in the subunit structures, oligomer associations, and active site organizations between the DAHPSs on the one hand and the KDOPSs on the other. The most important structural difference is the presence in the DAHPSs of two extra barrel segments that provide for the binding of the feedback inhibitor and the transmission of the allosteric ° inhibition signal to the active site located 20 A away.14 Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the family Ib DAHPS from Thermotoga maritima. As is typical for class I DAHPSs, the T. maritima

enzyme can use a wide variety of divalent metal cations as cofactor and is feedback-regulated, in this case by Tyr and Phe.24 Taking advantage of the fact that the reaction rate of this hyperthermophilic enzyme is negligible at 4 8C,24 we were able to determine the first structure of a DAHPS containing both substrates and metal cofactor bound at the active site. The structure has clarified the DAHPS reaction mechanism and has indicated a new mode of feedback regulation in the DAHPS family of enzymes.

Results
Subunit structure The subunit of DAHPSTm consists of two compact domains, a ferredoxin-like (FL) domain (residues 1 ­64) and a (b/a)8-barrel domain (residues 80 ­338) connected by a linker (residues 65­ 79) (Figure 1(a)). The FL domain is near the N-end of the (b/a)8-barrel away from its active site, which is located at the C-end. The two domains are separated by the linker sandwiched between a b-sheet of the FL domain on one side and helix a5 and loop a6 ­b7 of the (b/a)8-barrel on the other. The mutual orientations of the FL and the (b/a)8-barrel domains in the two crystallographically independent subunits of the enzyme (Figure 1(b)) differ by about 38 due to the slightly different bends of their linkers. The FL domain consists of two a-helices and a four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet and has a bab bab fold. Both helices are located on the solventexposed side of the domain, while the b-sheet forms an extensive contact with the linker that ° involves 900/830 A2 or 22/19% of the domain surface areas in the two crystallographically independent subunits. The b-sheet residues also participate in minor contacts with the (b/a)8-barrel ° of the same subunit (60/80 A2) and with the (b/a)8-barrel of the neighboring subunit in the ° dimer (110/120 A2). The FL domain likely plays a critical role in feedback regulation of the enzyme (discussed below). The (b/a)8-barrel domain of DAHPSTm contains the active site and appears to be solely responsible for catalytic function. Besides the eight strands and helices that form the barrel, the domain includes a two-stranded antiparallel b-hairpin that covers the N-end of the barrel. Another additional b-strand that consists of the three C-terminal residues of the enzyme forms a two-stranded, parallel b-sheet with b1, the longest strand in the barrel (seven residues), which also interacts with both the b2 and b8-strands of the barrel. The b ­a loops at the C-end of the barrel that form and surround the active site are rather long. Three of them, b2 ­a2, b6­ a6, and b8 ­a8, consist of 17 residues each; b7­ a7 has 11 residues and the other four consist of six or seven residues. In contrast, the a ­b loops at the N-end of the barrel, which are

not involved in the active site organization, are short, ranging from two to six residues. Quaternary structure Although DAHPSTm is a tetramer in solution,24 the asymmetric unit of the DAHPSTm ­Cd ­PEP ­ E4P crystal contains two subunits of the enzyme associated into a dimer (Figure 1(b)). Inter-subunit contacts include multiple polar and non-polar ° interactions over an area of 1430 A2 per subunit (10% of its total surface area). The interactions between the (b/a)8-barrel domains are responsible for 92% of the inter-subunit contact area. These interactions are provided by the b2 ­ a2, b3­ a3, b4 ­a4, b5­ a5, and b6 ­a6 loops of the C-ends of the barrels and by helices a4 and a5. The remaining 8% is contributed by the contact of the b2 ­a2 loop with the FL domain and the linker loop of the other subunit. The FL domains and linkers of the two subunits are located on the opposite sides of the dimer and do not interact. The enzyme tetramer is generated by applying the 2-fold crystallographic symmetry operator to the dimer in the asymmetric unit (Figure 1(c) and (d)). Two dimers associate into a tetramer by extensive interactions between the (b/a)8-barrel ° domains totaling 1340 A2 per subunit (9% of its total surface area). The barrel segments involved

in tetramer formation are helices a5 ­a8 and loops b5 ­a5, b6­ a6, and b7 ­a7. The FL domains and linker loops do not participate in the contacts between dimers. Organization of the active site As is typical for (b/a)8-barrel enzymes, the active site of DAHPSTm is located at the C-end of the barrel and is formed by the residues of its b­ a loops and b-strands. The active site of each barrel domain contains a bound metal cofactor, Cd2þ, and both substrates, PEP and E4P (Figure 2(a)). The substrates are clearly separated in the electron density maps indicating that neither reaction intermediates nor products have formed. The lack of substrate reactivity is presumably the result of the prevailing low temperature. The s-level of the E4P phosphate in the electron density maps is about 0.7­ 0.8 of the level of the PEP phosphate in both subunits. At the concentration present in the crystallization medium, PEP is likely to fully occupy its binding site. Thus, the E4P occupancy appears to be about 70­ 80%. PEP binding is similar in both active sites in the asymmetric unit. It involves numerous Arg and Lys residues that interact with both the phosphate and carboxylate groups of PEP (Figure 2(b)). The phosphate group is coordinated by the N atom of

The typical planar structure of PEP is deformed by about 158 due to the rotation of its

carboxylate group around the C1 ­C2 bond, as described for DAHPSEc.15 In contrast to PEP, the conformations of E4P in the two independent active sites differ. All E4P atoms except for the aldehyde O1 are visible in the electron density of one of the two crystallographically independent active sites (Figure 2(a)). The phosphate group of E4P is coordinated by N1

459 284 in KDOPSEc, 350 in DAHPSEc, and 370 in DAHPSSc). The topology of the barrel domain of DAHPSTm is most similar to those of the two KDOPSs. A total of 232 Ca atoms of DAHPSTm and KDOPSAa superimpose with an r.m.s.d. value ° of 1.3 A (Figure 3(a)) and 240 Ca atoms of DAHPSTm and KDOPSEc with an r.m.s.d. value of ° 1.4 A. These values are close to the r.m.s.d. values ° of 1.0 A for 236 aligned Ca atoms of the two KDOPSs. None of these three (b/a)8-barrels possesses significant extra barrel segments. The DAHPSTm (b/a)8-barrel domain is less similar to the DAHPSEc and DAHPSSc barrels. The ° r.m.s.d. values are 1.7 A for superposition of the Tm barrel both with 221 Ca atoms of DAHPS DAHPSSc and with 220 Ca atoms of DAHPSEc (Figure 3(b)). These two paralogs are very similar ° to one another with an r.m.s.d. value of 0.6 A for 335 Ca atoms. The major difference is the absence in DAHPSTm of the two extra barrel segments that are responsible for the feedback regulation of DAHPSEc and DAHPSSc.14 These segments are (1) an N-terminal extension that includes a b-strand and two a-helices, and (2) a two-stranded b-sheet, b6a/b6b, inserted between helix a5 and strand b6 of the barrel (purple segments shown in Figures 3(b) and 4(b)). Together they contribute the majority of the residues involved in inhibitor binding and provide the transmission of the allo° steric inhibition signal to the active site 20 A 14 Tm away. The absence of these segments in DAHPS indicates that this feedback-regulated enzyme binds its inhibitor in a different manner and has a different mechanism of inhibition. The ferredoxin-like domain and its proposed role in regulation The FL domain of DAHPSTm distinguishes it from the other DAHPSs and KDOPSs of known structure. However, a BLASTP25 sequence similarity search using residues 1 ­64 of DAHPSTm indicates the presence of the FL domain in more than 20 other microbial DAHPSs. Sequence identities range between 26% and 47%. Significantly, all the identified DAHPSs belong to family Ib. As already noted, the DAHPSs from E. coli and S. cerevisiae are family Ia enzymes.9 A DALI26 structural similarity search reveals about 160 functionally diverse proteins with threedimensional structures similar to the FL domain of DAHPSTm. The FL domains of three of these proteins, namely D -3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase,27 aspartate carbamoyltransferase,28 and threonine deaminase,29 are involved in the allosteric regulation of enzymatic activity, serving as a regulatory domain that binds the feedback inhibitor. Thus, a critical role for the FL domain in allosteric inhibition has been shown in three enzymes, two of which (PGDH and TD), like DAHPS, are the first enzymes of an amino acid biosynthetic pathway feedback-regulated by its end product. In view of the absence in DAHPSTm of the extra barrel

and Nh2 of Arg133, N and Og1 of Thr134 (b2 ­a2) and by a water molecule (Figure 2(b)). The hydroxyl group of E4P closest to the phosphate (O3) forms H-bonds with O of Pro132 (b2 ­a2) and Nh1 of Arg186 (b4 ­ a4). The other E4P hydroxyl group (O2) interacts with Og of Ser308, Od2 of Asp309 (b8 ­a8), and a water molecule. The position of the aldehyde C1 is defined but the electron density of the aldehyde O1 is diffuse. O1 is within H-bond distance from Nz of Lys131 but is ° more than 5 A away from the Cd2þ. The second E4P molecule in the other asymmetric unit has a different conformation due to rotation around the C3 ­ C4 bond. Although the electron density of this E4P is continuous, its features are less defined precluding reliable building of its carbon tail. Like the first E4P molecule, its aldehyde O1 atom appears to interact with Nz of Lys131 and is too far from the Cd2þ to be considered a metal ligand. Although in both active sites the si face of the PEP enol group is oriented towards E4P in accordance with the reaction stereochemistry, the position and orientation of the aldehyde groups of both E4Ps are not suitable for the enzymatic reaction. In the subunit with the better-defined E4P density, the distance between C3 of PEP and C1 of E4P, atoms that form the bond in the condensation reac° tion, is 4.2 A. In addition, the si face of E4P is exposed to the PEP enol group, even though the reaction involves its re face. In the other subunit the re face of E4P appears to be oriented towards PEP but the distance between C3 of PEP and C1 ° of E4P is still too long at 3.6 A. 2þ The Cd is coordinated by Sg of Cys102 (b1 ­ a1), 12 N of His272 (b7 ­a7), O12 of Glu298 (b8), and Od2 of Asp309 (b8­ a8) (Figure 2(b)). The closest distance between Cd2þ and the carboxylate O atom of ° PEP is 3.9 A; hence, there is no direct interaction between the metal ion and either substrate.

Discussion
Comparison of DAHPSTm with functionally related enzymes Crystal structures are known for four enzymes that are functionally related to DAHPSTm. These are the DAHPSs from E. coli (DAHPSEc)12 ­ 15 and S. cerevisiae (DAHPSc)16,17 and the KDOPSs from E. coli (KDOPSEc)18 ­ 20 and A. aeolicus (KDOPSAa).21 ­ 23 All five enzymes are homotetramers with (b/a)8barrel subunits that accommodate their active sites. Nevertheless, there are notable differences between them in subunit topology, subunit association, and active site organization. The catalytic (b/a)8-barrel domain In DAHPSTm, the (b/a)8-barrel domain includes the 259 C-terminal residues (80 ­338), whereas in the four homologs the barrel domain consists of the entire polypeptide (267 residues in KDOPSAa,

segments that underlie feedback regulation in DAHPSs of family Ia and the presence of an FL domain that clearly has no role in catalysis, we propose that DAHPSTm, and perhaps other DAHPSs of family Ib, possesses an allosteric mechanism that differs radically from that of the family Ia DAHPSs and involves its FL domain. In support of this idea, it has been found that excision of the FL domain of DAHPSTm eliminates feedback regulation by Tyr and Phe while causing only a minor reduction in catalytic activity (J.W. & R.W.W., unpublished results). The FL domain of DAHPSTm is located away from the active site of its own subunit but interacts with a b2 ­a2 loop of the active site of the neighboring subunit of the dimer. In the phenylalanineregulated DAHPSEc, the conformational change of its b2 ­ a2 loop upon Phe binding prevents E4P binding, resulting in the loss of activity.14 We speculate that the regulation of DAHPSTm also involves a conformational change of the b2 ­a2 loop of the barrel domain, mediated by the binding of the feedback inhibitor, either Tyr or Phe, to a regulatory site in the FL domain. Structural analysis of the enzyme with bound inhibitor is now underway to test this hypothesis. Quaternary structure The subunits of the five homologs associate into dimers in a similar orientation. In all cases the inter-subunit contact involves interactions between the (b/a)8-barrels that approach each other from the sides of helices a4 and a5. The barrels are oriented not side-by-side but tilted so that most of the contacts are formed by the C-end loops rather than by helices. The two active sites are near the interface. In DAHPSTm and the two KDOPSs, the inter-subunit contacts are limited to interactions between the barrels (Figure 4(a)). In DAHPSEc and DAHPSSc these interactions are significantly enhanced by the inter-subunit b-sheet formed by the extra barrel segments that forms the inhibitorbinding pocket, a feature absent in DAHPSTm and the KDOPSs (Figure 4(b)). In spite of the similarity in the dimer structure of the five enzymes, the tetrameric organization of DAHPSTm is similar to that of the two KDOPS homologs, differing significantly from that of DAHPSEc and DAHPSSc. The tetramers of the former three enzymes are formed by extensive contact between (b/a)8-barrels that approach each other from the sides of helices a6 and a7 (Figure 4(a)). The area of this contact is comparable with the area of inter-subunit contact in a dimer. The loops at the C-end of the barrel are also involved in tetramer formation so that the active site is located near the interface. In contrast, the tetramers of DAHPSEc and DAHPSSc are supported only by the interaction between residues of the extra barrel segments that are absent in DAHPSTm and KDOPSs (Figure 4(b)). The (b/a)8-barrels of the associated dimers do not form contacts.

Moreover, they approach each other from the sides of helices a2 and a3, opposite to that used in DAHPSTm. Active site structure All residues that interact with PEP in the active sites of DAHPSEc and DAHPSSc are conserved in DAHPSTm (Figure 5(a)). The only difference in PEP coordination is that the water molecule bound to the PEP carboxylate group in DAHPSEc and DAHPSSc is replaced by O11 of Gln182 in DAHPSTm. While the majority of PEP-coordinating contacts in DAHPSTm and the two KDOPSs are also similar, several differences are observed (Figure 5(a)). Arg186Tm, which binds the phosphate group of PEP, is absent in the KDOPSs. In addition, the interactions of the PEP carboxylate group with Nh1 and Nh2 of Arg126Tm are replaced by a single salt bridge with Nz of Lys and a water molecule is replaced by Og of Ser in the KDOPSs. The productive coordination of E4P in DAHPSTm has been modeled from its non-productive coordination in the "frozen" complex (see the next section). On the other hand, the binding of E4P in DAHPSSc17 and DAHPSEc (I.A.S., R.B. & R.H.K., unpublished results) has been inferred based on the structures that contain the E4P analog, glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) (Figure 5(b)). These three models are very similar and the E4P-coordinating residues are conserved in all. In contrast, the E4P binding by DAHPSTm and the A5P binding by KDOPSs show distinct differences that extend even to the coordination of the common phosphate group (Figure 5(b)). In KDOPSAa the A5P phosphate group interacts with atoms N1 and Nh2 of Arg49Aa and N and Og of Ser50Aa, analogous to the coordination of E4P by Arg133Tm and Thr134Tm. However, the binding of the A5P phosphate in KDOPSAa is enforced by the H-bonds with N and Og of Ser197Aa, located on the b7 ­a7 loop, which becomes ordered upon A5P binding, and with Nh1 of Arg106Aa of the companion subunit of the dimer. Although the A5P binding site of KDOPSEc is only inferred by a bound sulfate that mimics the A5P phosphate group,18,19 most of the residues that coordinate A5P in KDOPSAa are conserved. The metal binding sites of the three DAHPSs and of KDOPSAa are nearly identical (Figure 5(c)). Although KDOPSEc is a metal-independent enzyme, the corresponding region of its active site is similarly arranged. It contains His, Glu, and Asp residues with orientations close to those of His272Tm, Glu298Tm; and Asp309Tm, while Cys102Tm is replaced with Asn. In summary, the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of DAHPSTm are more similar to those of the KDOPSs than to the structures of DAHPSEc and DAHPSSc. This is consistent with the phylogenetic classification of the enzymes based on sequence similarity9 that places DAHPSTm, KDOPSEc and KDOPSAa in family Ib

and DAHPSEc and DAHPSSc in family Ia. In contrast, the active site of DAHPSTm is nearly identical to the active sites of the other two DAHPSs and differs from the active sites of the two KDOPSs. Implications for catalysis The T. maritima DAHPS ­ Cd ­ PEP ­ E4P complex is the first example of a DAHPS structure containing all reaction components, i.e. metal cofactor and both substrates. The presence of both PEP and E4P bound in the active site indicates that the low temperature impedes the functioning of the hyperthermophilic enzyme by affecting a catalytic step rather than substrate binding or product dissociation. A similar observation was made in the hyperthermophilic KDOPSAa complexed with Cd2þ, PEP, and A5P at 4 8C.21 ° The 4.2 and 3.6 A distances between C3 of PEP and C1 of E4P in the two independent active sites in DAHPSTm are both too long to allow bond formation. The PEP orientation and conformation appear appropriate for the reaction. The si face of

the PEP enol faces E4P in agreement with the reaction stereochemistry. The numerous interactions and low B-factors of the PEP atoms indicate tight binding; the mobility of PEP is likely to be limited because its coordination involves residues from several rigid b-strands of the (b/a)8-barrel. The coordination of E4P is less tight. The different conformations of the E4P carbon tail in the two active sites and the high B-factors of its atoms indicate a significant degree of rotational freedom. In the active site of DAHPSTm, the si face of the E4P aldehyde group is oriented towards the enol of PEP contrary to the stereochemistry of the reaction. Thus, a conformational change in E4P is essential to enable the condensation to proceed. We suggest that the transformation of E4P into its productive conformation is achieved by rotations around its s-bonds. The consecutive rotations around the P ­ 04 (308), O4 ­ C4 (358), C4 ­ C3 (1408), and C3 ­ C2 (458) bonds in the E4P conformer observed in the crystal (Figure 2(b)) ° bring the C1 atom of E4P within 2.8 A of C3 of PEP (Figure 6(a) and (b)).

C1 ­ C2 bond enables interactions of its O1 with Nz of Lys131 and Cd2þ. This rotation orients the re face of the E4P aldehyde group towards the PEP enol group in agreement with the reaction stereochemistry. The conformational change of E4P does not alter the coordination of its phosphate group, but two hydroxyl groups switch positions, as well as coordinating residues. O2 of E4P engages in H-bonds with O of Pro132 and O3 of E4P interacts with Od1 and Od2 of Asp309. The E4P transformation does not cause any steric violations except for a clash between the O3 hydroxyl group of E4P and a water molecule (the red dotted line in Figure 6(a)). The resulting model for E4P coordination is similar to those deduced from the recently solved structures of DAHPSSc ­ Co ­PEP ­ G3P17 and DAHPSEc ­ Mn ­PEP ­G3P (I.A.S., R.B. & R.H.K., unpublished results) in which G3P is a non-reactive analog of E4P that lacks the aldehyde group. The derived structure of the DAHPSTm productive complex enables us to designate the residues immediately involved in catalysis (Figure 6(b)) and to outline the DAHPS (and by analogy, the

KDOPS) catalytic mechanism. The proposed mechanism (Figure 6(c)) refines the one recently suggested ¨ by Konig et al.17 based on the structure of the DAHPS­Co­PEP­G3P complex from S. cerevisiae. In both the DAHPS and KDOPS-catalyzed reactions the release of the PEP phosphate occurs by cleavage of the C ­O bond rather than by the more conventional O ­P bond cleavage. Since the reaction proceeds through the formation of the linear intermediate, it must involve attack of the C2 atom of PEP by a water molecule. The only candidate for the attack on C2 of PEP in the reaction is water molecule Wa (Figure 6(b)). However, Wa is unlikely to begin the reaction by nucleophilic attack on the PEP enol. The extensive interactions of the phosphate and carboxylate groups of PEP with five Arg and Lys side-chains suggest that PEP is completely ionized carrying three negative charges and thus is not a favorable subject for nucleophilic attack. Moreover, Wa forms H-bonds with the side-chains of Glu164 and Gln182 that are unlikely to convert it to OH2. A similar situation is observed in both DAHPSEc and DAHPSSc where Wa interacts with a side-chain of Glu and another

464 water, and in KDOPSAa and KDOPSEc where it is coordinated by the side-chains of Asp and Gln. The attack by Wa is likely to happen at the second stage of the reaction, following the nucleophilic attack of C2 of PEP on the C1 of the activated aldehyde group of E4P. Thus, the electrophilic activation of the E4P aldehyde by Lys131Tm and a metal cation appears to be necessary for the initiation of catalysis. Lys131Tm is invariant in all known DAHPSs and KDOPSs and mutational analysis has shown it to be an essential residue in DAHPSEc (I.A.S., R.B. & R.H.K. unpublished results). The nucleophilic attack of the enol group of fully ionized PEP on the activated aldehyde group of E4P represents the first step of the reaction (Figure 6(c)). Consequently, a proton is transferred along the chain that includes Lys131Tm, Glu164Tm, and two water molecules completing the transformation of the aldehyde into a hydroxyl group. This initiates the nucleophilic attack of the water molecule, Wa, on the positively charged exC2 atom of PEP. Finally, the O ­ P bond is cleaved and the ex-PEP phosphate group is released, completing the reaction.

Materials and Methods
Protein purification and crystallization DAHPSTm was over-expressed and purified as described.24 The purified enzyme was dialyzed against 10 mM EDTA in BTP buffer (5 mM 1,3-bis-Tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylamino]propane (pH 7.0)), and then against 1 mM BTP buffer(pH 7.0), to remove EDTA. All solutions used for crystallization, except for the solutions of CdCl2 and protein, were treated with Chelex 100 to remove metal cations. The DAHPSTm ­ Cd ­ PEP crystals were grown at room temperature in 5 ml hanging drops using the vapor diffusion method. The drops contained 5 mg/ml DAHPSTm, 4% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 6.3 mM PEP, 0.8 mM CdCl2, and 100 mM LiCl in 50 mM BTP (pH 8.5). The reservoir solution contained 30% PEG 8000 in 50 mM BTP (pH 8.5). To prepare the complex of DAHPSTm with both substrates and a metal cofactor, DAHPSTm ­ Cd ­ PEP crystals were first transferred to the stabilizing solution (40% PEG 8000, 17.5 mM PEP, 4 mM CdCl2, and 200 mM LiCl in 50 mM BTP(pH 8.5)). After equilibrating for 24 hours at room temperature, the crystals were transferred to 4 8C and equilibrated for another 24 hours with another change of the same solution. Then the crystals were transferred at 4 8C to the stabilizing solution that also contained 17 mM E4P, soaked for 20 minutes with occasional stirring and frozen on loops in liquid nitrogen. Data measurement, refinement, and structural analysis The diffraction data set was collected at beam line X4A at the NSLS from a single frozen crystal in an evaporating nitrogen stream. Data were processed with HKL200030 and programs of the CCP4 suite31 (Table 1). The crystal belongs to space group C2221 with cell ° ° ° dimensions a ¼ 71.6 A, b ¼ 144.2 A, c ¼ 141.1 A and

° diffracted to 2.2 A. The asymmetric unit contains two subunits of DAHPSTm; the water content of the crystal is about 48%. Both (b/a)8-barrel domains that represent about 70% of the polypeptide chain in DAHPSTm were found by molecular replacement search with CNS32 using the structure of KDOPSAa21 as a model. The subsequent model building and adjustment was done with O.33 Refinement was carried out with CNS and REFMAC531 without non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. The search for bound water molecules was done with ARP/wARP.34 The structure alignments were performed with LSQMAN.35 All 338 residues of both subunits of DAHPS are visible in the final electron density map. While well-defined electron density for Cd2þ, PEP, and the phosphate group of E4P was observed from the first rounds of the refinement, the continuous density corresponding to the carbon chain of E4P appeared only later in the refinement. The refined model of DAHPSTm has R=Rfree values of 21.9/25.1% and includes 5258 protein atoms, two PEP and E4P molecules, three Cd2þ (two bound at the active sites and the third at the intermolecular interface in the crystal) and 159 bound water molecules. The model has good stereochemistry as analyzed by PROCHECK36 with 92.0% of the residues in the most favored regions and no residues in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Protein Data Bank accession codes The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with ID 1RZM.
