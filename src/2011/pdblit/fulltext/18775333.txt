Neutron small angle scattering on bacteriophage PM2 was used to identify the high molecular weight species and the solvent accessible volume in the structural compartments of the virus spherical shells in a model constructed from the extensive chemical and physical information on PMZ. For data analysis the scattering from the model was calculated in such a way as to simulate the real scattering situation, in which the neutron wavelength distribution and beam divergence lead to a significant smearing of the intensity. The calculated convoluted intensity was then fitted to the experimental data by varying the scatkring densities and the radii of the spherical shells. Scattering from solutions was studied at low resolution under a wide variety of solvent contrast conditions achieved by varying the H,0/2H,0 ratio. The dependence of the scattering densities in the shells on the H,0/2H,0 ratio, obtained on an absolute scale from model fitting, is interpreted in terms of a fractional contribution from solvent and dry species. The amount of protein, lipid and DNA, as well as the solvent volume fraction, are obtained for each shell. Scattering from pellets of PM2 at medium resolution was used to refine the shell radii and the scattering densities evaluated on solutions. An outer shell accommodates all of protein II and a significant amount of protein I. This shell does not penetrate into the viral membrane. The bilayer occupies a second shell; its dimensions agree with X-ray results. Protein III also appears t,o be m this shell, where it occupies about 50"/( of the volume. No water is found here. The allocation of protein III to the bilayer is confirmed by the analysis of low angle neutron and X-ray scattering on the nucleocapsid of PM2, where a protein layer extending from 207 A to 240 A is detected. The DNA in t,he inner shell is highly solvated. A fit to higher resolution data could be obtained using two shells for the nucleocapsid region. It is proposod that protein IV is at the interface of the DNA and the bilayer.

1. Introduction
Bacteriophage PM2 (cf. Franklin, 1974; Franklin et al., 1976) is an interesting model biological membrane with a considerable amount of protein in the bilayer (CameriniOtero & Franklin, 1972). The virus appears to be icosahedral in shape with forked spikes projecting from the vertices (Silbert et al., 1969). An outer diameter of 600 A and a bilayer centered at a radius of 220 A with an inter-polar group distance of 40 A were determined from low angle X-ray scattering (Harrison et al., 1971). PM2 has a molecular weight of 45x lo6 (Franklin, 1974) and contains four prot,eins, which account for 72% of the dry particle weight. Protein I is the spike protein; protein II forms the outer protein shell (Hinnen et al., 1974). Protein III is localized interior to the membrane and forms the capsid (Hinnen et al., 1974). Protein IV forms a complex with the nucleic acid (Hinnen et aE., 1974; Marcoli, 1978). The circular double-stranded DNA is superhelical (Espejo et aZ., 1969) and accounts for 14% of the particle weight (Camerini-Otero & Franklin, 1975). A nucleocapsid containing the DNA, protein IV, all of protein III and about 60 copies of protein II can be prepared by stripping the virus of the outer protein coat and the bilayer in urea solutions (Hinnen et al., 1974). This paper describes a further refinement of the structure of PM2 using neutron low angle scattering. The additional information available from neutron scattering as compared with X-ray diffraction originates from the large coherent scattering amplitude difference of hydrogen and deuterium (Schoenborn & Nunes, 1972; Jacrot, 1973). Isomorphous replacement of exchangeable hydrogen by deuterium in proteins and nucleic acid is readily achieved by replacing H,O in the aqueous buffer by the desired proportion of DzOt. The scattering amplitude density of these molecules is thereby a function of the partial deuteration (Worcester et al., 1975; Jacrot, 1976). Moreover, since the scattering density of common biological material is above that of man & Moore, 1975), contrast variation H,O and exceeded by that of D,O (E n ge1 and matching can be achieved by manipulating the D,O fraction in the solvent. Contrast variation experiments were described and used by Stuhrmann (1974) and by Ibel & Stuhrmann (1975) ; and the matching technique has been described by Jacrot et al. (1976,1977). The neutron low angle scattering experiments described here were intended to identify quantitatively the chemical species and the solvent volume in the structural compartments of bacteriophage PM2. These compartments are structural or functional regions accommodating few chemical species only, such that at low resolution the scattering density in these shells can be assumed to be homogeneous. They are equivalent to the step functions used in the interpretation of membrane Fourier profiles (Kirschner et al., 1975; Schoenborn, 1976). Experimental scattering amplitude density profiles are obtained from model fitting with the observed intensity patterns measured at various contrasts. The density profiles, put on an absolute scale by comparison of the scattering density of dry PM2 with that of the contrast matching buffer, are interpreted in terms of two contributions to the scattering density. The dry chemical species expected from biochemical data to be found in a given shell contribute an incremental scattering density that depends only slightly on the D,O fraction in the solvent. The solvent contributes another density increment with a dependence on the D,O fraction calculated from the volume not occupied by material of high molecular weight. Since about half of the particle volume of PM2 is

solvent-accessible, and since the scattering density of water varies between negative and large positive values, the two contributions can be separated. When this analysis is summed over t'he whole particle, the amount of protein, DNA and lipid at any radius can be calculated, along with the distribution of solvent in t,he particle. A spherical shell model was used to evaluat,e the radial scattering amplitude density profiles. For the PM2 structure previously investigated with small angle X-ray scat,tering to high resolution (Harrison et al., 1971), this approach is particularly useful in the analysis of low resolution neutron scattering, since it allows the incorporation of information of the electron density map into model radii. Togethei with biochemical information, estimated scattering amplitude densities can he calculated from the electron density profile for each of the shells. The structure factor of a spherical model consisting of n shells with scattering amplitude densities pi and radii ri, in a solvent with scattering density pS, is

and where G, is the structure factor of a sphere with radius ri (Guinier & Pournet, 1955), q = (4~~/h) sin 8, the momentum transfer, and /jv is the mean scattering density in the particle. Previous structural studies suggest a division into five shells. In the center of the particle there is a region of DNA and protein IV, enclosed by the second shell consisting of protein III. The third shell is the bilayer, accommodating the viral lipid and some protein. The fourth shell is the wide outer protein shell and a fifth shell accounts for the spikes. The amount of protein I forming the spikes is estimated to be to the scattering at low 3 to 4% of the total dry weight and should not contribute resolution. Thus we have a maximum of four shells to consider. We will show through our interpretation of the neutron scattering data that the distribution of components in these shells is somewhat different from that originally conceived.

2. Experimental Procedures
(a) Preparation of samples

for scattering

Bacteriophage PM2 was grown and purified according to the procedure of Hinnen et al. (1974). The preparations of the virus in solution were dialyzed against buffer A (l-5 M-NaCl. 0.02 M-Tris (pH 7.2 at 20°C), 0.01 M-CaClz, 0.02 M-/?-mercaptoethanol). The concentration was determined from the optical density at 260 nm using the relation A,,, unit/mg virus =: 4.6 (Camerini-Otero & Franklin, 1975) and adjusted to final values of l-0, 0.8, 0.6, 0-l and 0.2% (w/v). Portions (1 ml) of each concentration of virus were dialyzed to ecluilimixtures of H,O/DzO containing IO?& brium against 30 ml of buffer A in 11 different (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide. A 12th set of samples was dialyzed against 3 changes of pure DzO (buffer A + 10% dimethylsulfoxide). The concentration of the virus was controlled after dialysis. The outer dialysates were saved for buffer scattering. The actual D,O content was also evaluated from the trace of tritium in the D,O and was found to be within :if: 1% of the expected value. Scattering experiments were started within 3 days after sample preparation.

Pellets of virus were obtained from freshly prepared PM2 solutions dialyzed at a concentration of 1% against buffer B having the desired ratio of D,O/H,O. Buffer B is 2 M-NaCl, 0.02 ivr-Tris, 0.01 M-&Cl,, 0.02 M-8.mercaptoethanol (pH 7.2 at 20°C). The dialyzed solutions were free of aggregates and degraded products, as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation. The virus solutions were then pelleted in a Heraeus Christ Omega II preparative ultracentrifuge (1 h, 100,000 g, 4"C, SW52 rotor). The gel-like pellets were immediately transferred to a 1 mm thick quartz window of a demountable Teflon cuvet and then sealed in the cuvet. Droplets of buffer at the edge of the cuvet prevented the pellet from drying out. The supernatant from pelleting was saved for buffer measurements and used to evaluate the Da0 content in the buffer from the tritium content. Pellets of nucleocapsid were prepared from 1 y0 solutions of PM2 in buffer B containing only 1 M-NaCl. The virus was dissociated at 4°C by rapidly mixing 10 ml of virus solution with 20 ml of the above buffer containing 9 M-urea. The mixture was immediately layered on top of a linear gradient of 10% to 30% sucrose in the buffer of the mixture. The nucleocapsid was separated from proteins and lipids by zonal centrifugation in a Heraeus Christ Omega II preparative ultracentrifuge (4 11, 150,000 g, 4°C zonal rotor). The dissociated products were recovered in 5ml fractions by underlaying the gradient with a 60% sucrose solution. A sharp peak of optical densities (260 and 280 nm) was found with a ratio of 1975). The 60 ml of nucleocapsid solution was = 1.70 (cf. Schafer & Franklin, &!eol&3o divided into 3 fractions and they were dialyzed against buffer B prepared with 4 M-urea in the final HzO/DzO mixtures. Clear gel-like pellets were obtained by centrifugation (4 h, 150,000 g, 4°C SW30 rotor). The pellets were mounted as described above. (b) Neutron scattering experiments

All neutron scattering experiments were carried out at the high flux reactor of the Institute Max von Laue-Paul Langevin in Grenoble on the small angle scattering camera Dll, described by Ibel (1976). A short description of the instrument is given here for continuity. Neutrons tempered in liquid deuterium to wavelengths between 2 and 20 A are guided to the camera by a glass guide, bent to eliminate gamma radiation and fast neutrons. A mechanical velocity selector is used for monochromatization. Neutrons with a narrow triangular wavelength distribution are then guided by a rectangular glass tube to selectable distances from the sample. The cross-sectional area of 5 cm x 3 cm of the last guide in the beam is the apparent source at collimation length L from the sample (2 712Q L < 40 m). Diffracted neutrons are detected by a 2-dimensional BF, multidedistance D is variable (2 m < tector, consisting of 64 x 64 cells, each 1 cm `. The detector D < 40 m). Data acquisition is facilitated by following the diffraction experiment on a graphic display terminal that shows the actual memory state for all detector cells. Scattering from the virus in solution out to the first subsidiary maximum was measured distance of 9370 mm, a collimation length of 11,730 mm and a nominal using a detector wavelength of 8.2 A with a Ah/X = 0.08 (FWHM). The maximal diffraction spacing s = (2/h)sinfl was 0,005 A-l. The sample cuvet had 1 mm thick quartz windows and a diameter of 18 mm. The sample thickness was 2 mm. The virus solutions were measured at room Each measurement took about 20 min. Scattering from the solvent, recorded temperature. in about half this time, was scaled to obtain the background for the virus experiments by the use of the primary beam monitor. The background scattering was uniform with no angular dependence. Transmissions of all samples and buffers were recorded in exposures with the backstop removed. These were used to scale the data to the same total crosssection. Pellets of PM2 were investigated by a series of spectra, covering 2 to 7 subsidiary maxima. The most detailed scattering curves were obtained with a detector distance of 4370 mm, a collimation length of 11,730 mm and a wavelength of 5.4 A. Longer wavelengths were used to explore the first few diffraction maxima more precisely, and a sample detector distance of 2405 mm with a wavelength of 5.5 A was used to follow the overall shape of the scattering curve out to a resolution of 30 A. It was necessary to choose an asymmetric camera geometry with ratios for the detector distance to collimation length between 1 : 2 and 1 : 3 in order to resolve the diffraction structure sufficiently. Due to the long collimation lengths, which set the apparent neutron source far back from the sample, as well

as to the small sample diameter of 10 mm, measuring times as long as 50 min were required. Diffraction from pellets of the nucleocapsid was measured out to t,he 8th suhsidiar) maximum. Spectra covering the first 3 subsidiary maxima were obtained using a detector distance of 5405 mm, a collimation length of 10,695 mm, and with a nominal wavelength between 6.6 and 8.7 A. Higher resolution data were recorded with a detector dist,ance of 2405 mm, a collimation length of 5696 mm, and with nominal wavelengths of 7.1 or 9.0 .A. The measuring times were about 25 min. (c) Data reduction The raw scattering data obtained with the 2-dimensional detector were first corrected for non-uniform sensitivity in the 64 x 64 cells. The homogeneous intensity in the buffer spectra, measured interspersed with virus samples, was used to determine counting probabilities for horizontal and vertical rows of cells. Values between 0.9 and 1.1 were found. The counting probabilities of these rows were averaged over all buffers measured with the same detector position. Correction factors were obtained for each cell as the inverse of the product of the average counting probabilities of the corresponding horizontal and vertical rows of cells. The origins of the diffraction patterns were obtained as the center of mass of the primary beam, reduced through a semi-transparent cadmium backstop (5 cm x 7 cm). These origins were checked by a center of mass refinement of an outer diffraction ring and usually agreed with the origin first determined within a 5th of a cell side length. Cells in the corner regions and in the 2 outermost rows and columns on each detector side and the first completely non-shielded cells around the backstop were omitted from the spectra. Circular integration was performed in a set of adjacent annular rings, 0.25 t,o 0.5 cm wide, and centered around the origin. The area swept out of each cell by a given annulus is calculated and the contribution of each cell is taken proportional to this cell area fraction. The number of counts in each ring, normalized by division of the annuls] area, is identified as the observed intensity f(q,) (3), where qO is computed from the mean radius of the ring. The integrated intensity was sampled at 60 to 120 data points/spectrum. A discussion of this integration method will be given elsewhere (Schneider & Zulauf, manuscript in prepa.ration).

In our experiments, however, the wavelength spread of the neutrons, the extended and divergent primary beam and the finite sample size (Ibel. 1976) lead to a smearing of the calculated intensity. This smearing was described by 2 weighting functions, the wavelength weighting function f(h - h,) centered around the most probable wavelength h,, and the aperture weighting function h(t9 - 0,) centered around the nominal scattering angle f+,. The theoretical intensity I(q) -= 1(&t?) was corrected for the instrumental non-idealities by

The convoluted intensity f(qo), calculated from the model parameters and added to a q-independant background was fitted with the circularly integrated intensity by variation of the model parameters. An interactive computer program was used for non-linear leastsquares regression. Three groups of parameters involved in model-fitting can be distinguished.

They are usually known from separate experiments and used to define scattering on an absolute scale. (3) Instrumental parameters which enter into t,he computation are the wavelength weighting function f(X - A,) and the aperture weighting function h(6' - 8,). If not read from instrumental settings, they may be adjusted on the scattering patterns. A detailed presentation of the model and the fit procedure will be given elsewhere (Schneider & Zulauf, manuscript in preparation).

3. Results (a) Dilute solutions Scattering of 0.2 to 1% PM2 solutions was measured as a function of D,O concentration. For all measured scattering angles out to the second minimum the observed intensity was a linear function of the PM2 concentration (Fig. l(a)). Since intensities extrapolated to zero virus concentration and averaged over all experimental scattering angles were within the variance of the intensity recorded for the individual buffers, the average background in the experimental s-range was considered as part of the linear functions. Each set of spectra with the same D,O fraction in the buffer, corrected for background by the average buffer intensity, was superimposable on the spectrum of the 1o/ovirus solution within its integration error using the inverse of the virus concentration as a scaling factor. In Guinier plots of the background-corrected intensities between s = O-00075 8-l and s = 0.0015 A-l, all virus concentrations had the same radius of gyration within the errors of the linear regression. Guinier plots of one set of spectra are shown in Figure l(b). From the above

For the sodium salt of PM2 DNA, a molecular weight of 6.26 x lo6 is used (Camerini-Otero & Franklin, 1975) and a G + C content of 42% (Espejo et d., 1969). The contribution of the lipids is summed using the fatty acid distribution and the lipid composition from Camerini-Otero & Franklin (1972) and a total lipid molecular weight of 6.0 x 106. It is assumed that all hydrogen bound to N, 0 and S is exchanged to the H/D ratio in the buffer. The mean scattering amplitude density of dry PM2 is calculated using a particle diameter of 600 A, obtained from low angle X-ray

The difference of the scattering densit,y of the dry virus and the buffer at the matching point can be attributed to internal solvent, which is found to occupy 47.5&2% of the volume. The mean scattering amplitude density at any D,O/H,O fraction is calculated from the data on the dry particle corrected for internal solvent., as shown in Figure 4, line d. As a control, the mean scattering density of dry PM2 was calculated from its specific volume (Table 1). For the proteins, the solvent-inaccessible volume was computed from amino acid residue volumes (Chothia, 1975; Zamyatnin, 1972; to the average base-pair in Na-DNA Jacrot, 1976). A volume of 583 A3 was attributed (Cohen & Eisenberg, 1968), and the lipid volume was given by Camerini-Otero & Franklin (1972). The calculated mean scattering density equals the buffer density at the experimental matching point (Fig. 4, line c), showing that chemical composition and matching point are compatible. (c)

Low resolution spectra

A spherical three-shell model was used to fit the observed cross-sections of l?b solutions of bacteriophage PM2. As a consequence of the low resolution of the data shown in Figure 5 and of their variance, only a few parameters can be adjusted. Therefore, the radii of the spherical shells are fixed : the model bilayer extends from 205 A to 235 A and the outer radius is 300 A. The mean scattering density pU is taken from the values shown in Figure 4, line d. This value, together with the outer radius, provides an absolute scale. There are three adjustable parameters in the model: the densities of two of the shells and the forward scattered intensity, a scaling factor. In least-squares fitting of the model to the integrated intensities, convergence to a minimum variance is

The models have 3 shells with radii r, given in A and scattering amplitude densities pr given in units of 10" cmm2. The solvent density is ps; I, the forward scattered intensity; Is the background intensity. The mean scattering amplitude density pV = 0.285 x 10" cm-z is used to calculate the density in the 3rd shell from the variable pi values. Trapezoidal aperture weighting functions with a base-to-top ratio of 3.0 and half-height widths of 2 &,, rad (parameter 10) were used.

achieved on all spectra. Stable values in the parameters investigated are obtained after an average of five iterations. The best fits are shown in Figure 5 and the particle parameters are listed in Table 2. The significance of the parameters was evaluated in relat,ion t'o possible errors in the fixed parameters. Of the instrumental parameters, wavelength and aperture weighting functions, only errors in the latter were found to be significant for these low resolution spectra. Half-height widths of the trapezoidal divergence angle distribution outside 0~0015~0~00008 radians lead to systematic deviations of the fibted intensity from the data in the region of the first minimum. Two `Vits" with pronounced systematic errors are presented in Table 3 to demonstrate how this error influences the densities. Variations of the bilayer thickness only affect the scattering drnsit,y of this shell. Fits with variances of the same order of magnitude as t)he best' fit and with no systematic deviations are listed in Table 3 for a thin (25 A) and a very wide (35 A) bilayer shell. More crucial is the correct position of the bilayer. Bilayer cent,ers in the range of 220*5 A (&2%) cause scattering amplitude density variations in the DNA region and the outer protein shell of the same magnitude. Parameters for two examples are presented in Table 3. Small inaccuracies in the computed buffer densit,y ps or in the mean density pV are negligible, as they correspond roughly to an uncertainty in the D,O fraction in the buffer. Inaccuracies in the averaged background intensity do not, affect the result on PM2 in solvents with high contrast. The result of the contrast, variation experiment on PM2 solutions is shown in Figure 6. The errors in the shell densities were evaluated from variations in t,he nonfitted parameters as described above.

The diffraction patterns of PM2 pellets could be measured to the seventh subsidiary maximum, a resolution limit imposed by the 8% wavelength spread of camera Dll . On spectra which included a significant percentage of the central maximum the experimental intensity was compared to the intensity calculated from the model with the parameters determined in the previous section. Interparticle interference effects were manifested by a shoulder in the central maximum as shown in Figure 7. An attempt was made to describe interparticle interference using the Debye (1927) hard sphere approximation in equation (2). The experimental intensity in the central maxima of PM2 pellets containing locally ordered domains is at least one order of magnitude weaker than predicted by this approach. This weak forward scattering influences the first subsidiary maximum in experiments at higher resolution, where the central maximum is partly within the primary beam. This is manifest in a sharpening of the first minimum. In the model fitting described below, data points out to the first subsidiary maximum are excluded and the analysis is done on the

higher order diffraction rings as discussed for low angle X-ray scattering by Earnshan et al. (1976). Seven subsidiary maxima with increasing reciprocal space intervals were resolved in a spectrum from a pellet in buffer B containing 8% D,O (Fig. 8). Scattering measured to higher diffraction spacings shows a minimum in the completely smeared cross-section at s = 0.016 A-l. This sample scatbers more intensity in the first six subsidiary maxima than would be expected for a homogeneous sphere of the same outer diameter. These qualities are characteristic for a hollow sphere. The higher resolution of the spectra with well-defined maxima and minima permitted a refincment of the shell radii in addition to the densities. The fitted model was still restricted to an outer radius of 300 d and to the mean scattering amplitude density p,,, which is used as above to fix the density of the outer shell. The three-shell model with t#he parameters obtained in section (c), above, fits the experimental intensity out to the fourth subsidiary maximum, but at higher resolution the maxima are increasingly out of phase with the data. With a four-shell model, in which the nucleocapsid is subdivided into two shells, a satisfactory fit is achieved out t'o the seventh subsidiayv maximum. In this case an eight-parameter fit (three densities, the three inner radii. forward scattered intensity, background) drops into a unique and stable minimum for the variance. The result is shown in Figure 8. The four-shell model was refined on a group of spectra of this sample consisting of four to eight subsidiary maxima measured with various camera geometries and wavelengths. This provides a statistical method t'o find the variances in the investigated parameters. The results havr. however, different weights. Intensity pattorns with a few diffraction rings only, i.e. four maxima, could give rise to uncertainties in the radii. This was not observed.

since the minima and maxima were well-resolved due to good collimation. On the other hand, spectra extending to diffraction spacings larger than the outermost resolved maximum are comparatively more smeared in the first few minima. The diffraction angle difference between subsequent maxima becomes comparable to the average divergence angle of the primary beam. Intensity profiles with poorly resolved minima and maxima are unsuitable for model-fitting. Averaged values for radii and densities of six successful fits are quoted in Table 4. In the nucleocapsid region two slightly different densities are obtained, both higher than the denaity evaluated in a three-shell model on low resolution data. Position, width and scattering amplitude density in the bilayer are consistent with the result on solutions and about 10% less scattering density is located in the outer protein shell compared to the low resolution analysis. A virus pellet was investigated in buffer B containing 41% D,O, which closely matches the outer protein shell. Seven regularly spaced maxima were measured (Fig. 9). On spectra that extend to small scattering angles, the very weak central maximum and the position of the first minimum indicates a contrast close to the matching point of PM2. Again a fit was attempted with a three-shell model. Due to the contrast matching, which does not permit resolution of four shells, a fit to the entire data set can be obtained, although a small systematic deviation near s = 0.01 A-l occurs. The fit of a scattering curve with seven maxima is shown in Figure 9. Averaged particle parameters obtained on a group of spectra of this sample are listed in Table 4. Radii and scattering amplitude densities are consistent with the data evaluated from solution scattering. The third sample was a PM2 pellet in buffer B prepared with pure D,O. Neutron low angle scattering was followed to s = 0.05 A-l with an order-to-order resolution insufficient to distinguish subsidiary maxima. On this smeared intensity pattern

three nodes are observed at s = 0.012, 0.024 and 0.038 A-l. The calculated intensity of the model obtained in section (c), above predicts these nodes at comparable diffraction spacings. Spectra that resolve structure in the experimental intensity showed eight subsidiary maxima within s = 0.02 A-l (Fig. 10). Their spacing is considerably wider than one would expect for a homogeneous sphere of the same outer diameter, which would display 11 maxima within this diffraction spacing. These qualities indicate larger scattering density differences in PM2 solvated with D,O. The three-shell model deduced from solution scattering can be used to calculate an excellent fit to the observed spectra out to the second maximum, it also gives a good qualitative fit between the fifth to seventh maxima but on an intensity scale that is too low. If the nucleocapsid is subdivided into two regions, then the calculated intensity agrees with the data between the fifth to seventh maxima as well. Near the broad and poorly resolved fourth subsidiary maximum, however, the intensity calculated from the four-shell model does not describe the data precisely. Attempts were made to fit the spectra using five-shell models. No improvement in the fit could be achieved by this approach. A typical four-shell model fit with seven experimental maxima is shown in Figure 10. Averaged parameters of four models obtained on higher resolution data of this sample are summariied in Table 4. Since the fit near the fourth subsidiary maximum does not describe the data adequately, curve-fitting with one or several altered parameters was carried out on all spectra (cf. Results, section (c); Table 3). These tests confirmed the correctness of the averaged model. Scattering densities for the outer protein shell and the bilayer are comparable with the result obtained from solution scattering. The nucleocapsid is seen as a two-shell structure with a region of scattering density close to the buffer density and a region of lower scattering density inside a radius of about 165 A with an upper limit of 180 A and a lower limit of 150 A.

The virus solutions were analyzed after the neutron scattering experiments b> polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The four standard proteins were present in the relative amounts usually seen for intact virus (Hinnen et al., 1974). These PM2 samples had the same ultrastructure before and after irradiation, as revealed bJ electron microscopy of negatively stained virus (Silbert et nl., 1969). Bacteriophage pellets were controlled after the neutron scattering experiments by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by X-ray low angle scattering on a point focusing camera. All pellets, regardless of the D,O content in the buffer, had an integrated intensit! indistinguishable from that of freshly prepared virus to a resolution of about 30 A. (f) Nucleocqsid The small angle diffraction patterns from pellets of nucleocapsid prepared in SC::, D,O buffer containing 4 M-urea and in pure D,O buffer show seven regularly spaced subsidiary maxima (Fig. 11). Using the Bragg minimal wavelength principle (Bragg & Perutz, 1952), we estimate a particle diameter of 445 A. From the first minimum at an s value of 0.0023 8-l, which is too low for a homogeneous sphere of 445 8, diameter, from the high count rates in the subsidiary maxima as compared to the central maximum, and from their regularly decreasing intensity, we can characterize the particle as a thin-walled hollow sphere. Fits of a two-shell model were attempted with the nucleocapsid spectra extending t,o the highest resolution measured. The relative weights of the scattering densities in the shells with respect to a mean density estimated from the chemical composition, the shell radii, and the forward scattered intensity were the variables in these fits. The background intensity was held at the value measured on the buffers. In order to control the background on the scattering of the nucleocapsid. the asymptotic behavior

of the observed intensities, 1, was analyzed in a plot of Is4 as a function of s4 (Luzzati et al., 1976). From the ordinate value et s4 = 0 obtained from the extrapolation of a linear fit with the Is4 values at higher arguments we calculate the background of the nucleocapsid samples to be identical with that measured on the buffers. Since the nucleocapsid was analyzed on a relative scale, the relative weights of the scattering densities in the shells are obtained. Parameters for both samples are listed in Table 4. In low angle X-ray scattering on the same nucleocapsid samples as those investigated with neutrons, a series of regularly spaced subsidiary maxima extending to a diffraction spacing of 0.03 A-l is obtained. A broad diffuse ring with three faint ripples that are in phase to the diffraction pattern at lower scattering angles is centered at 28 A, as in the case of PM2 (Harrison et al., 1971). Fourier inversion shows the nucleocapsid to have an inner region of uniform electron density extending to 205 A enclosed by a region of lower electron density extending to 240 A.

4. Discussion
(a) Mean scattering amplitude density

Scattering spectra on solutions of bacteriophage PM2 were collected to the second minimum. As a consequence of the camera geometry at Dll, about a third of the central maximum is lost in the backstop. The smallest diffraction spacing measured was s = O-0007 A- l. Approximating PM2 by a homogeneous sphere of 600 A diameter we calculate the limiting s value for a successful Guinier fit from the momentum transfer that equals the reciprocal of the expected radius of gyration (Jacrot, 1976) to be s = 09007 A-l. Therefore, Guinier plots were used only as a test for the absence

of interparticle interference. The values of the radii of gyration evaluated on PM2 in buffers with good contrasts, however, were close to those expected from model calculations with the diffraction patterns computed from the three-shell model. In the example of Figure l(b) the experimental radius of gyration was 250 A and thus comparable to the calculated value of 255 A. Because of the limited beam time, and because an interpretation of the radius of gyration of bacteriophage PM2 requires model assumptions, it was decided to explore the small angle diffraction to higher resolution at the expense of a precise measurement of the central maximum t'o very small angles, and to apply model fitting on these more detailed data. The zero forward scattered intensity was evaluated in a series of parabolic fits with the intensities of a given small scattering angle for all experimental D,O concentrations. These fits can be carried out at any scattering angle, provided the scattering density at any radius in the virus is a linear function of the H,O/D,O fraction in the buffer. Indeed, parabolas could be fitted at all experimental scattering angles of PM2 solutions and no residual intensities IM were detectable. Due to the linear dependence of the scattering densities in PM2 on the D,O fraction, the minimum concentration cM(s) can be expressed in terms of two amplitudes, AnsO and /li,,,Js) (compare with Results, section (b)). Since the cent)ral maxima of PM2 in H,O and D,O are comparable in shape and width, constant C~ values are expected for very small reciprocal spacings (up to 0*0006 8-l) as in the case of a homogeneous or a hollow sphere. At larger reciprocal spacings chl(s) will increase and finally diverge near the first minimum of the scattering pattern of PM2 in H,O (0.002 A-l). Considering a wide variety of three-shell models, constructed from biochemical and X-ray information, and taking all instrumental distortions into account. we empirically found a power fit to describe the expected cy(s) within 0.1 y; out to an s value of 0.0018 a-l. The experimental cDI(s) values could be well fitted using this approximation. Model fitting with the low resolution data provided a forward scattered intensity extrapolated from all of the experimental points. The forward amplitudes derived from these forward scattered intensities were linearly dependent on the D,O fraction in the buffer and the matching point obtained in this way was equal to that evaluated without model assumptions. (b) #o&vent volume fraction in bacteriophage PM2

A solvent-accessible volume in PM2 of 47*5+2% was deduced from a comparison of the scattering amplitude density of the buffer and the dry virus at the contrast matching point using a particle diameter of 600 A (Harrison et al, 1971). Since we cannot measure with good precision the degree of hydrogen/deuterium exchange of the individual PM2 proteins, which are poorly soluble in aqueous solutions (Hinnen et al.? 1974) or of the intact virus, all hydrogen bound to N, 0 and S was assumed to be substituted by deuterium to the H/D ratio in the solvent. This is a reasonable assumption. In the case of haemoglobin, only 17"& of all hydrogen in polar bonds does not exchange after 12 hours exposure to D,O (Schelten et al., 1972). In the case of myoglobin crystals, most of the hydrogen in the polar side-chains is replaced by deuterium and only a quarter of the main-chain amide groups do not exchange hydrogen after a long D,O soaking (Norvell t Schoenborn, 1975). About 70,; of t'hr exchangeable hydrogen of myoglobin in solution is not equilibrat,ed after 30 hours (Englander & Staley, 1969). The assumption concerning exchangeable hydrogen in .PM2> equilibrated with

D,O for at least 72 hours, has in any case a minor influence on the calculated solvent volume fraction. If 10% of the 5 x IO5 hydrogen atoms bound to N, 0 and S in the PM2 proteins are non-exchanging, the scattering amplitude of the dry constituents in PM2 will decrease by 1% at the matching point, an uncertainty that propagates to the solvent volume fraction as +l%. As a consequence of the dominant role of the internal water, the forward scatter of PM2 in pure D,O buffer increases by only 1% when 10% of the hydrogen is non-exchangeable. This effect is too small to measure. From intensity fluctuation spectroscopy, the radius of the hydrated virus is 330f3 A and the overall solvation 59*2x (vo 1ume H,O/volume hydrated PM2) (Camerini-Otero et al., 1974). Assuming in the space between the radii at 300 A and 330 A only external water, the internal solvent volume fraction is calculated to be 45.5% and thus shows the value from neutron scattering to agree with that determined hydrodynamically. Furthermore, the summed specific volumes of all of the PM2 constituents, calculated from molecular data, i.e. residue volumes for amino acids and base-pair volume for DNA, fill a sphere of radius 242 A, in agreement with et al., 1974). the dry radius of 245 A (Camerini-Otero

in PM2

By analysis of low resolution neutron scattering on PM2 using a spherical threeshell model with fixed radii we were able to evaluate the scattering amplitude density distribution in the particle under 12 different contrast situations. The scattering densities in the shells were linearly dependent on the D,O fraction, thus showing that the radii were fixed at the appropriate values. To refine the scattering densities and the radii, higher resolution data from pellet,s were investigated and analyzed with a model restricted only with respect to the outer radius and the mean scattering amplitude density. The successful fits with the higher resolution data show that an outer radius of PM2 fixed at 300 A is fully compatible patterns. Furthermore, models were fitted with all of the radii with the diffraction as variable parameters on spectra with well-resolved minima and maxima. From these fits and from the uncertainty in the wavelength determination of 1% (Ibel, 1976), we conclude that the neutron data confirm the diameter of 600 A measured by low angle X-ray scattering (Harrison et al., 1971). Restriction of the model to the mean scattering amplitude density, calculated on an absolute scale for any D,O fraction from a comparison of the scattering density of the dry virus and the buffer at the matching point, is used to evaluate the scattering densities in the shells on an absolute scale. Diffraction patterns measured to higher resolution on virus pellets were in all cases related to solution scattering, since the first few higher order maxima could be fitted with the models evaluated on solutions. The results on the scattering amplitude densities in the outer shell are summarized in Figure 12(a). Densities obtained from medium resolution data suggest a slightly steeper DzO dependence than is found in the analysis of PM2 solutions measured at low resolution. Assuming all of protein I to be localized with protein II in this compartment, we calculate the solvent-accessible volume in this shell from the difference of the buffer density at the shell matching point and the scattering density of the partially deuterated dry proteins in the shell volume to be 45% (compare with Results, section (b)). This amount of solvent, when added to the dry proteins, leads to a calculated scattering amplitude density (H,O, 0.09 x loll cme2 ; D,O, 0.45 x loll cm-z) that agrees well with the experimental finding (H,O, 0.09 x 1011 cmm2; D,O,

The lipid polar groups in the outer layer of the PM2 membrane, defined as in the interpretation of myelin neutron Fourier profiles (Kirschner & Caspar, 1972) are included in the calculations, even though they cont'ribute only about 2% to the scattering amplitude of the dry constituents in this shell. The solvent volume in the outer shell corresponds to about half of all the internal solvent in PM2 and the value deduced from the scattering densities is within l"i;, of the value estimated from a comparison of the specific volume to the shell volume. The solvent volume fraction of 0.45 in the virus coat is comparable to the solvation in the outer protein layer of tomato bushy stunt virus evaluated by Harrison (1969). An electron density of 0.40 electrons/A3, calculated from the chemical composition of the proteins and the amount of buffer in the shell, is in agreement with the experimental value obtained from low angle X-ray scattering (Harrison et al., 1971). A fraction of the protein I molecules is external to a radius of 300 A and forms spikes (Hinnen et al., 1971). Half of the volume of the protein I molecules localized outside the viral coat would lead to a somewhat steeper D,O dependence, just within possible errors of the analysis. Localization of the spikes in an additional shell could

not be confirmed on the medium resolution data, as this shell was fitted with a density indistinguishable from the solvent. Furthermore, the diffraction pattern of PM2 which was stripped of the spikes by mild bromelin digestion (Hinnen et al., 1974) was superimposable on that of intact PM2. From the high scattering density of the outer shell in water and the observed D,O dependence, we conclude that protein II cannot take part in the biluyer structure. Close packing of the outer proteins is indicated by the solvent volume fraction in the shell which is even lower than the solvent volume fraction of 52% in haemoglobin crystals (Boyes-Watson et al., 1947). Neutron scattering thus shows the surface proteins in PM2 to be organized in a shell that does not penetrate the bilayer. This suggestion is reinforced by a number of observations. In electron micrographs of negatively stained virus a dark band is seen at the interface of the two stain-excluding regions of the bilayer and the outer protein, indicating separation into two shells (Silbert et al., 1969). The electron density map from low angle X-ray scattering resolves a broad outer protein peak from the peak of the lipid polar groups (Harrison et al., 1971). Furthermore, protein II is basic with a very high isoelectric point (SchHfer et al., 1974a) and interacts electrostatically with the negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol preferentially found on the outer bilayer leaflet (SchLfer et al., 1974b). A width of 27 to 29 L%for the low density region in the viral bilayer is found from model fits with the experimental intensities of all three virus pellets. PM2 membrane acid) as the most abundant fatty acid (Camerini-Otero & with C 16:1 (palmitoleic Franklin, 1972) thus has a hydrocarbon region of comparable width to the low density region in neutron Fourier profiles of dipalmitoyl lecithin (Worcester, 1976). In these Fourier profiles the polar group distance is about 40 A. Assuming for the PM2 membrane similar relations between the electron density and the scattering amplitude density profiles as shown for the myelin membrane by Kirschner & Caspar (1972), we calculate the width of the electron density trough of the PM2 bilayer from the dimensions of the bilayer shell to be about 20 A. The estimated values for polar group distance and bilayer width agree with the electron density map of Harrison et aE. (1971). The best fit for the radial position of the PM2 bilayer center is 221 a in all cases, in agreement with the value obtained by low angle X-ray scattering. Experimental scattering amplitude densities for the bilayer shell are summarized in Figure 12(b). The contribution of the lipids to the scattering density in this shell is close to zero (Schoenborn, 1976). Since the total lipid volume accounts for only 40 to 50% of the bilayer volume (Camerini-Otero & Franklin, 1972), there must be a significant protein contribution. In fact, as the observed scattering density varies to non-hydrated protein. We little with the D,O fraction, it can only be attributed conclude from the allocation of protein II to the outer shell, the average scattering amplitude density of 0.08 x loll crnm2, and from the lipid volume in this shell, thud protein III is part of the bilayer. From a comparison of the experimental D,O dependence with that calculated assuming all of protein III to be in the bilayer shell, we estimate that 50 to 75% of protein III must be buried in the bilayer. The upper limit is favored, considering the non-lipid volume in the bilayer. This interpretation is shown in Figure 12(b). With an electron density of 0.27 electrons per A3 for paraffin chains (Caspar & Kirschner, 1971) and with the amino acid composition of protein III, an electron density in the bilayer of 0.29 electrons per A3 is calculated, close to the value of 0.30 electrons per A3 obtained by low angle X-ray scattering (Harrison et al., 1971).

Protein III is very hydrophobic, insoluble in water but extractable with organic solvents, and thus displays properties of a proteolipid (Folch & Lees, 1951) even t)hough there is no detectable lipid moiety in protein III (Hinnen et ul., 1976). Hydrophobic interactions between protein III and the lipids are suggested both from scattering and biochemical evidence. This interpretation of the PM2 membrane is compatible with that of rod outer segment membrane. In that case the neutron Fourier profiles in the hydrophobic region were interpreted in terms of non-hydratIed rhodopsin and hydrocarbon chains (Saibil et al., 1976). The icosahedral shape of PM2, particularly apparent in electron micrographs of positively stained thin sections of PM2 pellets (Silbert et al., 1969) may influence the scattering patterns at medium momentum transfer, where less intensity would br detected compared to a strictly spherical object. This has been shown by calculations on a model in which the scattering density between subsequent shells is linearly interpolated (Schneider & Zulauf, manuscript in preparation). Since it was possible to carry out the analysis of neutron scattering with a spherical shell model we cannot resolve the icosahedral shape of PM2 with our data. The validity of the spherical approximation, successfully applied in the low angle X-ray structure analysis (Harrison et aZ., 1971), is further supported by the circular appearance of the stainexcluding bilayer trace in electron microscopy and a shape intermediate between an icosahedron and a sphere is expected from the packing of identical protein units in a protein coat (Caspar & Klug, 1962). Width and scattering density of the bilayer shell are found with consistent values at very different contrast situations. Virtually an identical result for density and width is obtained on medium and low resolution data and in the case of the latter data the icosahedral convolution certainly has no influence. From these considerations the assignment of protein III to the bilayer as discussed above must be correct. For the nucleocapsid region, as analyzed from scattering on pellets of PM2, the average scattering amplitude densities are shown in Figure 12(c). On the higher resolution data this region was fitted with higher contrast to the buffers than in the analysis of the low resolution spectra. The dependence of the scatt'ering density in the nucleocapsid region on t,he D,O fraction is best explained assuming a minimal protein content. Thus the allocation of protein III to the bilayer is favored by the experimental scattering density in the nucleocapsid region. Half of the polar groups of the phospholipid are assumed to be in the nucleocapsid region: they contribute little to the scattering amplitude and the specific volume. The solvent-accessible volume deduced from the experimental points in Figure 12(c) at the calculated matching point of the DNA is 77%. Comparing the volume inside the bilayer with thr summed specific volumes of DNA, all of protein IV and 25% of protein III, a solventaccessible volume of 70% is calculated. In the interpretation shown in Figure 12(c) t.he solvent volume fraction is taken to be 75% in order to adequately model t,he data at high D,O fractions. This amount of buffer, with the composition used in the low angle X-ray work (Harrison et aZ., 1971) and the chemical composition of the molecules allocated above, are used to calculate an electron density of 0.40 electrons [JW A3 and this is compatible with the X-ray value. The medium resolution data on PM2 pellets in buffers containing either 80,, 01 100% D,O were fitted with two shells for the region inside the bilayer. In the first case the two shells were evaluated to have a small scattering densit'y difference. At t'his D,O fraction an interpretation of the two shells is particularly difficult as thr

solvent, which accounts for most of the observed scattering densities in the shells at high D,O fractions, has a scattering density close to zero. Thus, the main parameter used to evaluate the volume fraction occupied by material of high molecular weight is missing. From the two-shell structure which was necessary to fit the intensity patterns at higher resolution we conclude that DNA, protein and solvent are not homogeneously arranged in the nucleocapsid. The diffraction patterns of the sample in pure D,O buffer could not be fitted satisfactorily over the entire experimental s-range. Since the nodes observed in the scattering at higher momentum transfer are predicted by the model evaluated on PM2 solutions, and since the average value of the scattering densities in the nucleocapsid region, as well as the densities for the other shells, are physical values, the deviation of the calculated intensity from the observed data is of minor influence to the result. The scattering density of the inner shell in the DNA region is clearly below a value expected for DNA and the density of the second shell in this region is unrealistically high. This indicates, in agreement with the two densities fitted for the nucleocapsid region on PM2 pellets in 8% D,O, a denser packing of the DNA in the central region and a solvent-rich domain near the lipid polar heads. The radius separating these two shells is evaluated to be about 165 A. The lower limit of this radius overlaps with the upper limit of the smallest radius evaluated with a large error on PM2 pellets in 8% D,O. From the diffuse diffraction ring observed in low angle X-ray scattering at 28.5 A (Harrison et aZ., 1971) we calculate, according to Earnshaw et al. (1976), a hexagonal unit cell dimension of 33 A for a packing of PM2 DNA. Using their value of 190 daltons per A for the mass per unit length of B-DNA (Earnshaw et al., 1976), the radius of the volume equivalent sphere for hexagonal packing of all of the DNA is 193 A. This calculated radius suggests that the DNA extends close to the bilayer; and the radius of 165 A obtained from neutron scattering probably is the depth to which protein penetrates into the DNA region. Neutron scattering of the nucleocapsid, analyzed on a relative scale with two spherical shells showed an outer shell between the radii at 207 A and 240 A in which most of the excess scattering density is located. Assigning all of protein III and the 60 copies of protein II to the outer shell and assigning the DNA-protein IV complex to the inner shell, a fraction of the scattering densities in the two shells of 1.78 and 1.97 for the nucleocapsid in aqueous and D,O-rich buffer, respectively, is calculated from chemical composition and estimated solvent volume fraction. We obtain a scattering density fraction of 1.8 and 2.4 in the fits, in rough agreement with the above values. Since in low angle X-ray scattering from the nucleocapsid the diffuse ring centered at 28 A is detected even under protein matching conditions (D. Schneider & R. M. Franklin, unpublished observations) at the same spacing as for the unaltered DNA arrangement entire bacteriophage (Harrison et al., 1971), indicating and thus an identical volume for the nucleocapsid region, and since in the electron density map of the nucleocapsid the homogeneous electron density at the DNA site extends to 205 A, a radius which is compatible with the radius enclosed by the bilayer in PM2, we conclude that the isolated nucleocapsid is isometric with the corresponding structure in the virus. Protein III, the major constituent in the outer shell of the substructure, is external to a radius of 207 A, in agreement with the allocation of this protein to the bilayer as deduced from the scattering of the entire PM2. The diameter of the nucleocapsid of 480 A is compatible with the inner diameter of the

outer protein layer in PM2 which was, in the analysis of scattering from the virus, t,he maximal dimension of the compartment for protein III. In contrast to the case of the whole virus, the diffraction pattern of t,he nucleocapsid did not permit resolution of structure in the DNA region. This is, however. no proof for a homogeneous DNA region, as the intensity pattern, though consisting of six well-resolved subsidiary maxima, was not measured to a resolution where interference of the contributions of the shells to the amplitude would show up as nodes in the overall intensity. Summarizing our interpretation as discussed above, the structure of bacteriophage PM2 can be characterized by the following spherical shell model (Fig. 13). (1) The outer protein shell (between 235 and 300 8) accommodates protein II and a significant fraction of protein I. This shell does not penetrate the bilayer. The solvent volume fraction is 45%. (2) Internal to this is the PM2 bilayer consisting of about, equal volumes of phospholipid and protein III. Most of the volume of the protein III molecules are buried in the bilayer and only a small fraction is found in the DNA region. No solvent is present in this shell. (3) The DNA is in the center of the particle, where the solvent volume amounts to about 75%. Near the interface of the DNA and t'he bilayer shell there is a domain with a higher solvent volume fraction in which probein IV is probably associated with the DNA.
