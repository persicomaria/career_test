S8 is one of the core ribosomal proteins. It binds to 16 S RNA with high af®nity and independently of other ribosomal proteins. It also acts as a translational repressor in Escherichia coli by binding to its own mRNA. The structure of Thermus thermophilus S8 has been determined by the Ê method of multiple isomorphous replacement at 2.9 A resolution and re®ned to a crystallographic R-factor of 16.2% (Rfree 27.5%). The two domains of the structure have an a/b fold and are connected by a long protruding loop. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal interact through an extensive hydrophobic core and form a tightly associated dimer, while symmetry-related molecules form a joint b-sheet of mixed type. This type of protein± protein interaction could be realized within the ribosomal assembly. A comparison of the structures of T. thermophilus and Bacillus stearothermophilus S8 shows that the interdomain loop is eight residues longer in the former and reveals high structural conservation of an extensive region, located in the C-terminal domain. From mutational studies this region was proposed earlier to be involved in speci®c interaction with RNA. On the basis of these data and on the comparison of the two structures of S8, it is proposed that the threedimensional structure of speci®c RNA binding sites in ribosomal proteins is highly conserved among different species.

Introduction
Ribosomal protein S8 is one of the core ribosomal proteins. It binds to the 16 S rRNA with high af®nity and independently of other ribosomal proteins. In Escherichia coli S8 binds speci®cally and independently to the central domain of 16 S rRNA (Ungewickell et al., 1975; Zimmermann & SinghBergmann, 1979; Wower & Brimacombe, 1983; Gregory et al., 1988; Mougel et al., 1993) and interacts cooperatively with ribosomal proteins S6, S15 and S18 (Gregory et al., 1984; Stark et al., 1984; Svensson et al., 1988), playing an important role in

the assembly of the 30 S subunit of the ribosome (Nomura et al., 1996; Held et al., 1974). According to neutron diffraction studies (Capel et al., 1987) and cross-linking experiments (Tindall & Aune, 1981; Lambert et al., 1983) S8 is neighbor to proteins S2, S4, S5 S12, S15 and S17 in the 30 S subunit. S8 is also able to regulate gene expression in E. coli by binding to its own mRNA, thereby acting as translational repressor of the spc (spectinomycin-resistance) operon, which includes the genes for ribosomal proteins L14, L24, L5, S14, S8, L6, L18, S5, L30 and L15, in that order (Yates et al., 1980; Dean et al., 1981; Mattheakis & Nomura, 1988). The S8 target site on the spc mRNA is at the junction of the genes encoding proteins L24 and L5 (Mattheakis et al., 1989) and is similar to the S8 binding site in the 16 S rRNA in both its primary and its secondary structure

234 (Gregory et al., 1988; Ceretti et al., 1988). However, the apparent association constant of the S8 ± mRNA complex is almost on order of magnitude less than that for the S8 ±rRNA complex (Gregory et al., 1988; Wu et al., 1994), probably due to two single bulging bases that are present in the mRNA but not in the rRNA. Despite the large amount of data available on S8 ±RNA interactions and on the S8 binding site in RNA, our understanding of the structural features of the protein that mediate its association with RNA is very poor. Some attempts have been made to identify the RNA binding region in S8 through the use of proteolytic fragmentation (Peterakis & Littlechild, 1982), chemical modi®cation (DayaGrosjean et al., 1974; Mougel et al., 1986) and mutagenesis experiments (Wower et al., 1992; Wu et al., 1993). Recently, the structure of S8 from Bacillus Ê stearothermophilus was determined at 1.9 A resolution and three potential functional sites were proposed from the consideration of highly conserved patches of basic and aromatic residues (Davies et al., 1996). S8 from the extreme thermophile Thermus thermophilus contains 138 amino acid residues (Reinbolt et al., 1993) and shows 61% sequence identity with S8 from B. stearothermophilus. We have determine the three-dimensional structure of T. thermophilus S8 independently by multiple isoÊ morphous replacement at 2.9 A resolution. Comparison of this model with B. stearothermophilus S8 allowed us to identify a putative RNA binding site based on the conservation of the three-dimensional structure of this region. The packing of symmetry-related molecules in T. thermophilus S8 crystals suggests a possible mode of interaction of S8 within other ribosomal proteins on the ribosome.

Ê and phase extension techniques to 2.9 A resolution (Cowtan, 1994). The ®nal structure contained resides 2 to 138 and was re®ned to an R-factor of 16.2% (Rfree 27.5%) and had a good geometry (Table 2). The mercury atom was found in close vicinity to C134, suggesting a covalent bond to the sulfur atoms of the cysteine. A portion of the 3Fobs À 2Fcalc electron density maps is shown in Figure 1. Structure of the protein The overall three-dimensional structure of S8 from T. thermophilus (Figures 2 and 3) is closely related to the structure of B. stearothermophilus S8 (Davies et al., 1996). The location of secondary structure elements is presented in Figures 2 and 4. The molecule consists of two tightly associated domains, both of which have the split b-a-b structure. The domains are connected by a long loop protruding from the main core of the molecule. The N-terminal domain (residues 1 to 64) contains a three-stranded (b1, b2, b3) antiparallel b-sheet ¯anked by two helices (a1 and a2) on one side and exposed on the other. The C-terminal domain (residues 82 to 138) contains a partially buried antiparallel b-sheet (b6, b8, b9, b10), one side of which makes close contacts with helices a1 and a2 from the N-terminal domain and is involved in the interdomain hydrophobic core. Stands b6 and b7 follow each other through loop 7 in a direction antiparallel to strand b10, which bends to participate also in the antiparallel b-ribbon (b7, b10). Loop 7 together with this b-ribbon forms a b-hairpin. The long loop between strands b7 and b8 contains a few residues in a 310 helix conformation, while strands b9 and b10 are connected by a short and highly charged helix a3. Strands b3 of the N-terminal and b6 of the C-terminal domains are directed approximately at 60 to each other and are connected by a long interdomain loop (residues 65 to 81), containing a short ribbon. The conformation of this loop is stabilized by three hydrogen bonds between the residues of the loop and the top of the N-terminal domain. Most of the conserved residues are located in the C-terminal part of the C-terminal domain (Figure 4 and 5). The two molecules in the asymmetric unit of T. thermophilus S8 crystals form a tightly associated dimer and have identical conformations with a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation between Ca Ê atoms of 0.39 A. The b-strands of the C-terminal domains from both molecules form an interface at the top of the domains and participate in a peculiar kind of intermolecular b-sheet. An extensive dimer contact area is formed by residues V79, L107, I109 and W138 from both molecules and has primarily a hydrophobic character. Residue L107 is highly exposed in the monomer, but completely buried in the dimer. The hydrophobic contact area is sandwiched between two approximately plane clusters of positively charged residues R102, R104, R105 and R122 from both molecules. The dimer is sup-

Results
Structure determination Crystals of T. thermophilus S8 belong to the space group P41212 with cell parameters Ê Ê Ê a  b  67.86 A, c  174.09 A and diffract to 2.9 A resolution. Two or three molecules per asymmetric Ê unit correspond to Vm values of 3.16 or 2.10 A3/ dalton, respectively (Matthews, 1968). Both of these values fall within the range typical of proteins of this size. Four derivatives were found by conventional soaking techniques (Table 1). All of them showed a considerable lack of isomorphism Ê at resolution higher than 3.5 A. The best derivative was obtained with mercury and two sites were located from a difference Patterson map. Both mercury atoms had the same occupancy and were most probably associated with cysteine residues. As the T. thermophilus S8 molecules has only one cysteine residue it was assumed that the asymmetric unit contains two molecules. Isomorphous Ê phases calculated at 3.2 A resolution were improved and extended by density modi®cation

Thermus thermophilus S8 Crystal Structure

a Two crystallographically independent molecules in the asymmetric unit.

ported by two hydrogen bonds between residues of the interdomain loops of both molecules. The crystal packing of symmetry-related S8 molecules also reveals an interesting feature. The b-sheet of the N-terminal domain (b1, b2, b3) from one molecule participates in a joint ®ve-stranded b-sheet of mixed type with the b-hairpin of the C-terminal domain (loop 7, b7, b10) of the symmetry-related molecule. The intermolecular contacts are provided by hydrogen bonds between the parallel strands b2 and b7 (Figure 6). Comparison of the structures of T. thermophilus and B. stearothermophilus S8 The structures of T. thermophilus and B. stearothermophilus S8 were superimposed using the leastsquares option of the program O (Jones et al., 1991). The comparison reveals that the main difference between the two structures is in the interdomain loop 6, which is eight residues longer in the T. thermophilus protein. It is also longer than the corresponding loops in all other known S8 sequences (Figure 4). This loop is mostly hydrophilic and contains four positively and two negatively

charged residues. Half of them are involved in hydrogen bonds or ion pairing. Another difference is observed in loop 8 (residues 96 to 108), which in T. thermophilus S8 contains two fragments of a 310 helix instead of one in B. stearothermophilus S8. With the interdomain loop excluded, the superpoÊ sition yielded an r.m.s. deviation of 1.68 A for all a Ê for the N-terminal domain C atoms, and 0.68 A (residues 4 to 64). When only the Ca atoms of the N-terminal domains were used for the superposition, the b-strands of the C-terminal domains also superimposed quite well, while the remaining parts of the C-terminal domains were shifted relative to each other. This means that the structure of the interdomain region is essentially preserved and that the S8 molecule does not display domain ¯exibility. Superposition of the C-terminal domains (residues 82 to 138) yielded an r.m.s. deviation of Ê 1.62 A for all the Ca atoms. A superposition of residues 109 to 132 yields a much lower r.m.s. deviÊ ation of 0.26 A, a result of a very similar threedimensional structure of this region in both S8 molecules. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit form dimers in the crystals of both T. thermophilus and B. stearothermophilus. However, the contact areas between the molecules are different in the two cases. Contrary to the primarily hydrophobic character of the contact area for the T. thermophilus dimer, it is more hydrophilic for the B. stearothermophilus protein and formed by residues around H90 (K98 in T. thermophilus S8).

Discussion
RNA binding sites in S8 The interaction between E. coli ribosomal protein S8 and 16 S rRNA was investigated by detailed kinetic and thermodynamic studies (Mougel et al., 1986) and by extensive site-directed mutagenesis (Gregory et al., 1988; Mougel et al., 1993; Allmang et al., 1994), Selex experiments (Moine et al., 1997) and chemical probing (Mougel et al., 1987; Allmang et al., 1994). The minimal binding site for S8 is localized on an irregular helical region of the central domain of E. coli 16 S rRNA around the universally conserved A642 (Mougel et al., 1987). The core nucleotides of this minimal site are highly evolutionarily constrained (Allmang et al., 1994) and thought to contain non-canonical features. Indeed, triple interactions were recently demonstrated by Selex experiments (Moine et al., 1997) and NMR spectroscopy (Kalurachchi et al., 1997). The latter study suggests that binding of the protein is accomplished without signi®cantly altering the RNA structure. Altogether, these results indicate that the core region of RNA provides a de®ned three-dimensional structure speci®cally recognized by S8 (Moine et al., 1997; Kalurachchi et al., 1997). S8 also makes contacts with a second site located in the lower part of the helix. This site appears to be mainly non-speci®c, most likely involving interactions with the phosphate backbone. This suggestion is consistent with a decreased reactivity of the corresponding phosphate groups towards ethylnitrosourea in the S8 ± RNA complex (Mougel et al., 1987) and with the recent observation that S8 is unable to form a stable complex with a short helical fragment containing the core region but lacking the three terminal base-pairs of the lower part of the helix (Kalurachchi et al., 1997). Sites on 16 S rRNA required for S8 recognition are very similar in E. coli and T. thermophilus (Vysotskaya et al., 1994). Moreover, it was shown that T. thermophilus S8 binds to T. thermophilus and E. coli rRNA fragments with a similar af®nity (Vysotskaya et al., 1994) and a similar two-site foot-

print was induced by E. coli S8 on T. thermophilus RNA (Moine et al., 1997). These data suggest that the speci®c binding sites in S8 and 16 S RNA have conserved three-dimensional structures. Here we used the superposition of the T. thermophilus and B. stearothermophilus S8 structures to search for a conserved RNA binding site. The region of the C-terminal domain around residues 109 to 132 including strands b8 and b9 and part of strand b10, loops 9 and 10 and helix a3 (Figure 4) can be aligned very accurately against the corresponding B. stearothermophilus region (r.m.s. deviÊ ation between Ca atoms of 0.26 A). This C-terminal region correlates strikingly with a putative RNA binding site in T. thermophilus S8 (residues 114 to 132) suggested earlier from mutagenesis experiments with E. coli S8 and on the basis of sequence comparisons of S8 from T. thermophilus and E. coli (Mougel et al., 1986; Wower et al., 1992; Vysotskaya et al., 1994). This region also contains residues included in the potential RNA binding sites 2 and 3 of S8 from B. stearothermophilus (Davies et al., 1996) identi®ed on the basis of the distribution of patches of conserved basic and aromatic amino acid residues. These observations make this Cterminal region of S8 the most favored site for speci®c RNA binding. In addition it was shown that the removal of 51 residues from the N terminus of the protein has little effect on its interaction with RNA (Uma et al., 1995), whereas in mutants with 30 amino acid residues (Wu et al., 1993) or with only eight residues missing from the C terminus (Uma et al., 1995) the RNA binding capacity was found to be severely decreased. The structural organization of S8 shows that the elimination of eight residues (strand b10) from the C terminus will lead to the destabilization of the domain structure. Moreover, a strong effect on E. coli S8 RNA binding was found with a point mutation, C126S (Wu et al., 1993). This mutation lead to a dramatic reduction in the conformational stability of the protein and signi®cantly reduced its RNA binding ability, whereas mutant C126A could bind RNA with the same af®nity as wildtype S8. The residue in this position (135 in T. ther-

239 The strategy for locating speci®c RNA binding sites, developed for the S8 protein, can be applied to other primary RNA binding proteins. It is known that the ribosomal protein L1 from E. coli has the ability to bind speci®cally not only to a variety of bacterial and archael 23 S rRNA (Stanley et al., 1978; Zimmerman 1980; Zimmerman et al., 1980; Baier et al., 1989) but also to eukarial 26 S/28 S rRNA (Gourse et al., 1981). Similar ``cross-reactivity'' towards RNA from different organisms has been observed for the ribosomal proteins L11 (Thompson et al., 1979; Beauclerk et al., 1985; El-Baradi et al., 1987) and S15 (Serganov et al., 1997). Moreover, it has been shown that for the phylogenetically unrelated species like E. coli and M. vannielii the L1 proteins are functionally interchangeable within the ribosome as well as in repression of translation (Kearney & Nomura, 1987; Baier et al., 1990). This suggests that the conservation of the three-dimensional structure of speci®c RNA binding sites may be a common feature of many ribosomal proteins from different organisms. In addition to demonstrating the presence of patches of aromatic and basic residues, a feature common to protein ±RNA interactions, the strategy applied here may serve as a guideline in identi®cation of RNA binding sites. Protein ± protein binding sites in S8 Analysis of the packing of S8 molecules in the crystals may suggest possible types of protein± protein interactions of biological importance. The intermolecular contact between symmetry-related molecules is provided by the parallel strands b2 and b7 from the N and C-terminal domains of different molecules, respectively (Figure 6). These sites may be used in S8 interactions with other proteins in the ribosome. Thus, the C-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein S5, one of the nearest neighbors of S8 in the ribosome (Tindall & Aune, 1981; Lambert et al., 1983; Capel et al., 1987), contains a three-stranded antiparallel b-sheet, one side of which is totally exposed (Ramakrishnan & White, 1992). This b-sheet of S5 could be hydrogen-bonded to strand b7 (residues 90 to 96) of the C-terminal domain of S8 in much the same way as the symmetry-related S8 molecules in our structure (Figures 6 and 8). The exposed strand b2 (residues

mophilus numbering) belongs to strand b10, which is involved in the b-sheet of the C-terminal domain. The hydrophilic nature of the serine sidechain and a new hydrogen bond potential could disrupt hydrophobic interactions, causing changes in the b-sheet and as a result cause a defect in the structure of the C-terminal RNA binding region. It has been shown that S8 may protect several 16 S rRNA sites (Powers & Noller, 1995). The interdomain region of T. thermophilus S8 contains three arginines and one lysine residue and contributes to an extended positively charged patch on the surface (Figure 7). Basic residues of the interdomain loop also contribute to this patch. This elongated positively charged surface should be present in S8 from different organisms, since the corresponding part of each amino acid sequence contains several basic residues. Therefore this patch could interact unspeci®cally with negatively charged sugar ±phosphate backbones of 16 S RNA.

CuKa radiation from a Rigaku RU-200 X-ray generator operating at 50 kV and 80 mA. Typically, the crystal was rotated a total of 60 with increments of 0.5 and an exposure time of 15 minutes per frame. The frames were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK programs (Otwinowski, 1993). To decrease non-isomorphism the derivative data sets were scaled to native data using the program CTAB (S. Nikonov, unpublished results). The anomalous differences were not measured accurately enough and were therefore not used. Structure determination The structure was solved using the standard method of multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR). The major heavy-atom sites of CH3HgCl2 and (NH4)IrCl6 derivatives were found from difference Patterson maps and Ê re®ned at 3.5 A resolution. Phases were calculated from each derivative, and cross-difference Fourier maps con®rmed the location of the heavy atoms. Positional parameters for other derivatives and for minor sites of (NH4)IrCl6 were determined from difference Fourier maps. Phases improved by solvent ¯attening were used Ê for these calculations. The 3.2 A resolution MIR phases based on all four derivatives were improved and Ê extended to 2.9 A resolution by solvent ¯attening and histogram matching with the program DM (Cowtan 1994). The overall ®gure of merit was 0.565 for the isomorphous data and was increased to 0.862 after density modi®cation. The data collection and phasing statistics are shown in Table 1. Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging was not used because no signi®cant peak of the selfÊ rotation function could be found. The 2.9 A resolution MIR phases were used to calculate the electron density maps. The map interpretation and model building were performed with the program O (Jones et al., 1991). First, the N-terminal domain was built into the electron density map for both molecules. The partial model was used for phase combination which improved the electron density and facilitated the building of the C-terminal domain. The complete structure of the molecule was built in several iterative steps using the combined MIR and partial model phases. The ®nal model contained all but the N-terminal residue. The model was re®ned by alternating rounds of manual rebuilding and simulating annealing using the È program XPLOR (Brunger, 1992). All crystallographic calculations were performed using the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994). The quality of the ®nal model was assessed using the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). Amino acid sequences were obtained from the SWISS-PROT data bank (Bairoch & Boeckmann, 1993) and aligned with the program CLUSTAL V (Higgins, 1994). The coordinates of S8 from B. stearothermophilus were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank.

totally exposed hydrophobic residue L107 protrudes out of the plane formed by positively charged residues R102, R104, R105 and R122 at the top of C-terminal domain. In the dimer, observed in T. thermophilus S8 crystals, L107 residues from both molecules form the center of the hydrophobic contact area between the molecules. In the ribosome, this region may also serve as a contact area for one of the neighboring proteins. Another exposed hydrophobic site is located at the top of N-terminal domain around V19 and serves for intermolecular contacts.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of T. thermophilus S8 The protein S8 from T. thermophilus ribosomes was initially puri®ed in non-denaturing conditions, identi®ed and characterized (Reinbolt et al., 1993; Eliseikina et al., 1995). The gene encoding T. thermophilus S8 has been cloned, sequenced and overexpressed in E. coli cells (Vysotskaya et al., 1994). Puri®cation of overproduced S8 protein was performed as described by Vysotskaya et al. (1995). Crystallization The overproduced protein was puri®ed and crystallized as described (Eliseikina et al., 1995; Tishchenko et al., 1997). Crystallization experiments (Tishchenko et al., 1997) were carried out using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique at 24 C with 6ml drops of the protein solution equilibrated against 700 ml of a reservoir solution. Drops containing 25 to 30 mg/ml protein, 40 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 1 mM dithiothreitol were at ®rst equilibrated against 40% saturated ammonium sulfate (unbuffered) with 7% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. After one or two days, precipitate was observed in the drops and the reservoir solution was exchanged for water. Then small crystals appeared in the drops and the water in the reservoir was exchanged for 16% saturated ammonium sulfate (unbuffered) with 5% (v/v) 2-methyl2,4-pentanediol. Crystals with dimensions of 0.6 mm Â 0.4 mm Â 0.4 mm could be obtained in a few weeks. Preparation of heavy-atom derivatives The heavy-atom derivatives were prepared by soaking crystals in the stabilizing solution containing 40 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), with 5% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (v/v) to which heavy-atom compounds were added. Four suitable derivatives were used for phasing (Table 1). X-ray data collection and processing Preliminary X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out on an Elliott GX-13 rotating anode generator operating at 35 kV and 35 mA. The size of the focal spot was 0.2 mm Â 0.2 mm. The cell dimensions and space group were determined using precession photographs taken with an Enraf-Nonius camera. Diffraction data were collected at room temperature on a MarResearch 300 mm imaging plate detector system (crystal-to-plate distance of 170 mm) using graphite monochromatized
