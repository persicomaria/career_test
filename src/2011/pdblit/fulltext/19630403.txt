By utilizing structure-based drug design (SBDD) knowledge, a novel class of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 10A inhibitors was identified. The structure-based drug design efforts identified a unique "selectivity pocket" for PDE10A inhibitors, and interactions within this pocket allowed the design of highly selective and potent PDE10A inhibitors. Further optimization of brain penetration and drug-like properties led to the discovery of 2-[4-(1-methyl-4-pyridin-4-yl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-phenoxymethyl]quinoline (PF-2545920). This PDE10A inhibitor is the first reported clinical entry for this mechanism in the treatment of schizophrenia.

Introduction The phosphodiesterase (PDE ) gene family has led to the identification of drugable targets and treatments for various disease states. With the success of the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil,1 Pfizer initiated a gene family initiative to identify potential therapeutic utility for the 21 different human PDE genes.2 Out of this effort, PDE10A was identified as a potential target for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. PDE10A is highly expressed in the medium spiny neurons of the striatum3 and has been shown to regulate both cGMP (Km = 7.2 M) and cAMP (Km = 0.26 ).4 It is believed that inhibitors of PDE10A will regulate cyclic nucleotide signaling in the corticostriatothalamic circuit. It has previously been shown that PDE10A inhibitors are active in a variety of preclinical models that may predict efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia.5 Although compounds with high PDE affinity have been readily identified, achieving high selectivity is still a key challenge. There are distinct differences in the full length structure of the PDEs, but it is not surprising that the catalytic domains that share a common function have a much more conserved structure. All the PDEs possess a common gluta Coordinates of the PDE10A crystal structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank for compound 1 (3HQW), 2 (3HQY), 3 (3HQW) and 9 (3HR1). *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

mine, and for the dual substrate PDEs, this residue can rotate to form donor-acceptor hydrogen bonds to both cGMP and cAMP. There is a common hydrophobic clamp that is made up of lipophilic amino acids that form a stacking interaction with the purine-like heterocyclic core of both cGMP and cAMP. In addition, there is a common bimetal ion binding center that binds the phosphates of the cyclic nucleotides.6 PDE inhibitors have potential therapeutic utility but also have potential unwanted safety risks due to off-target PDE inhibition. Some examples that have been reported in the literature are with PDE6 inhibition and visual disturbances7 and PDE3 inhibitors with cardiovascular changes.8 A previous publication has highlighted the quinazoline series of PDE10A inhibitors, which were challenged with PDE3 selectivity issues.9 Results and Discussion In an effort to identify a more selective class of PDE10A inhibitors, a diverse set of compounds from our internal compound collection were screened for PDE10A affinity. This effort identified triarylimidazole 1 (Figure 1), which has a PDE10A IC50 of 35 nM and displays >100Â fold selectivity against the other PDEs.10 Examination of its cocrystal structure with the PDE10A catalytic domain (Figure 2) revealed the basis for this extraordinary selectivity. It showed a binding interaction that is markedly different, not just from other PDE10A inhibitors but from PDE inhibitors in general. Unlike previously known PDE inhibitors, this inhibitor does not make a hydrogen bond with the conserved glutamine Gln-726.2 Instead, the side chain amino nitrogen of Gln-726 is positioned directly above the center of one the methoxyphenyl groups, thus making a favorable amino- interaction.11 Most importantly for selectivity, the thiophene occupies a lipophilic pocket near the entrance of the hydrophobic cleft that defines the common PDE substrate binding site. Additionally, the imidazole accepts a hydrogen bond at

the top of the pocket from the OH of Tyr-693, which accepts a hydrogen bond from the carbonyl of conserved Gln-726. A comparison of the known PDE crystal structures and profiling the inhibitor binding site led us to determine that the

lipophilic pocket occupied by the thiophene group is unique to PDE10A in the PDE family for the following reasons. First, among all the 21 PDE family proteins, only PDE10A has a glycine residue at position 725, next to the conserved glutamine.2 The presence of a larger side chain in all other PDEs blocks access to this lipophilic pocket. In addition, the residues that form the back of this lipophilic pocket are from the M-loop, which connects helix 14 and 15. Because of an insertion, this loop is longer in PDE10A than all the other PDEs except PDE5 and PDE6, which results in this pocket being deeper in PDE10A than all other PDEs. Finally, PDE10A has Tyr-693 to form a hydrogen bond interaction with which to anchor an inhibitor in this pocket. In addition to PDE10A, this potential hydrogen bonding group is only found in PDE2, where access to this pocket is blocked by a leucine residue of PDE2. Utilizing the structural knowledge of how to obtain selectivity for PDE10A, we implemented a strategy to develop multiple chemical series to address attrition risks. We had been focusing on multiple chemical series, but none of these bound in the selectivity pocket and possessed the desired physiochemical properties.12 After the biological confidence in rationale was built through the quinazoline and triaryl imidazole series, we undertook a full file high-throughput screen (HTS). To identify lead series with built in selectivity, we only pursued diverse hits from this screen that had potential to bind in the PDE10A selectivity pocket and to form a hydrogen bond with Tyr-693. To confirm our hypothesis, we subjected promising hits to X-ray crystallography to unambiguously identify their binding modes. In addition, we focused on identifying lead structures with drug-like physiochemical properties. We targeted leads that had a molecular weight less than 400, were only moderately lipophilic with a ClogP e4, and contained a minimum number of hydrogen bond donors to increase our probability of achieving brain penetration. These physicochemical targets are a major change from the PDE5 inhibitors that are on the market.13 Compounds like sildenafil (Figure 3) have difficulty accessing the CNS compartment due to their size (Mw = 475) and polarity (TPSA=113). Out of this high-throughput screen, we found multiple chemical series that met our desired criteria. One that was rapidly prosecuted is exemplified by novel pyrazole compound 2 (Figure 4). In this case, the X-ray crystal structure of 2 confirmed the quinoline formed a hydrogen bond to the desired tyrosine and occupied the "selectivity" pocket (Figure 5). Pyrazole 2 was a fairly efficient inhibitor (ligand efficiency=0.37)14 of PDE10A with an IC50 of 11.5 nM and possessed reasonable physicochemical properties with a molecular weight of 392 and a ClogP of 4. Further screening guided by SBDD led us to identify compound 3, where the

methylene has been excised. Pyrazole 3 is a subnanomolar PDE10A inhibitor with an IC50 of 0.42 nM and exhibits >1000Â selectivity over the other PDEs. This series of pyrazoles represents a nonclassical binding mode for a PDE inhibitor. They do not form a hydrogen bond interaction with the conserved glutamine as most PDE5 and PDE4 inhibitors do. Pyrazole 3 maintains the hydrogen bond to the tyrosine and occupies the PDE10A selectivity pocket but goes deeper into a pocket behind the conserved glutamine than HTS hit 2. The pyridyl nitrogen also forms a hydrogen ° bond to a water molecule (2.6 A) that is hydrogen bound to the PDE10A backbone. This deeper penetration of an additional binding pocket and the hydrogen bond to the water molecule may help explain the significant increase in potency that is seen with compound 3. Synthesis of 3 was completed starting with 4-hydroxyl benzoic acid methyl ester 4 and alkylating with 2-chloromethyl quinoline followed by hydrolysis to afford the desired acid 5. Activation of the acid with thionyl chloride and Weinreb amide formation provides the coupling partner 6 in good yield.15 The anion of 4-picoline (2 equiv) was formed with lithium diisopropyl amide (LDA) and added to a tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of the Weinreb amide coupling partner. Two equivalents of the anion were necessary to achieve an acceptable yield of 7 (80%). Following treatment with dimethoxymethyl-dimethyl amine to form the enaminone 8, hydrazine was added to form the desired pyrazole compound 3. Compound 3 is an excellent lead structure with improved potency over compound 2. It also shows a reduced drug-drug interaction liability with less CYP3A4 inhibition (IC50 > 10  vs 450 nM compound 2) due to the sterics around the pyridyl nitrogen and the deactivation of the pyridine by conjugation to the pyrazole.16 While this lead compound had the requisite potency and selectivity, it fell short of a drug candidate in terms of its in vivo efficacy. It raised cGMP levels in the striatum 350% at 10 mg/kg and was active in the conditioned avoidance response task (CAR)17 with an ED50

of 5 mg/kg (SC) but required a high free plasma concentration in mice (15 nM) in relation to the PDE10A potency (0.42 nM) to achieve activity. The high ratio of free plasma exposure relative to the enzyme IC50 (36Â) to produce the desired biochemical and behavioral effect was the result of modest brain penetration (brain/plasma = 0.21). These higher free and total drug levels could lead to an increase in safety risks and led to a higher dose projection to sustain efficacy in humans. These liabilities directed us to identify compounds with improved CNS penetration. Our strategy to improve brain penetration was to maintain molecular weight and remove the hydrogen bond donor present in pyrazole 3. The enaminone 8 (Scheme 2) afforded a versatile intermediate to rapidly synthesize compounds with this desired profile. Treatment with small hydrazines afforded substituted pyrazoles and addition of hydroxyl amine provided an isoxazole. In addition, treatment with amidines delivered pyrimidines, which allowed us to determine the optimal ring size of the core heterocycle. The SAR for the pyrazole and pyrazole replacements that remove the hydrogen bond donor was very promising (Table 1). Substitution of the pyrazole with simple alkyl groups retained potency while adding minimal molecular weight. The simple methyl substituted pyrazole 9 (PF-2545920)18 proved to be 0.37 nM and in an in vitro P-glycoprotein (PgP) overexpressing cell line had improved the efflux ratio from 2.3 to 1.0.19 We expected that this reduced PgP liability would improve our brain penetration and in vivo efficacy. The pyrazole heterocycle was the most potent of the five-membered heterocycles prepared, with isoxazole 14 displaying a significant loss in potency. The pyrimidine analogues were also significantly less active than 3, potentially due to the decreased bond angle between the phenyl and pyridine rings. This may prohibit the pyridine ring from making a key hydrogen bond to a tightly bound water molecule. To test the hypothesis that the pyridyl hydrogen bond to the water molecule was crucial for PDE10A affinity,

aromatic and heteroaromatic replacements for the pyridine ring were designed. Compounds 16-20 (Table 2) were synthesized from the Weinreb intermediate 6 (Scheme 1) utilizing the anion chemistry that has previously been described. As predicted by the X-ray crystal structure, compounds 18 and 19 that could not accept a hydrogen bond to the water were significantly less active. The two heterocyclic analogues that could form a hydrogen bond, pyrimidine 16 and pyridazine 17, retained good affinity but were significantly less potent than 3. To further understand the SAR discrepancy of 16 and 17, the nitrogen hydrogen bond strengths of the heterocycles were computationally estimated. Ligand binding is a complex process, and binding energy contains contributions from

multiple components such as ligand and protein interactions, conformational strain, and desolvation. For a closely related congeneric series of compounds, we assumed similar contributions from one or more of these binding components. In particular, if we assume most of the energetic terms are similar for compounds 3, 16, and 17 except for the ability of each heterocycle to make a hydrogen bond to the water molecule in the active site, we could computationally test this hypothesis by calculating their hydrogen bond strength. The hydrogen bond energy was computed by applying pseudospectral local second-order Moller-Plesset or the PS-LMP2 method.20 The model system was built by using the crystal water bound to the pyridyl nitrogen and the corresponding heterocycle derivatives. The structures were optimized with X3LYP/6-31G**,

and the binding energies were calculated using two correlation-consistent basis sets (cc-pVTZ(-f) and cc-pVQZ(-g)) and LMP2 theory, including corrections for the basis set superposition error.21 As expected, pyridyl 3 calculates to have a stronger interaction with the crystal water (Table 2) by more than 0.5 kcal/mol of energy. It is interesting to note that this calculation correctly predicts the rank order of the compounds in terms of potency but does not predict the absolute potency difference seen between 3 and 16/17. In an effort to understand how lipophilicity affected human liver microsomal intrinsic clearance in this series, compounds 25-28 (Table 3) were designed that replaced the quinoline ring with a more polar bicyclic aromatic group.19 To rapidly prepare these desired targets compound 24 was synthesized (Scheme 3) utilizing similar chemistry that has been described in Scheme 2. From the phenol, coupling with the heteroaromatic benzyl alcohols utilizing Mitsonobu chemistry afforded compounds 25-28. Out of this effort, potent compounds with both 9- and 10membered bicyclic aromatic groups with lower ClogP were identified. As intended, some of these analogues showed reduced human liver microsomal intrinsic clearance compared to the parent. Compound 28 was not metabolized by human liver microsomes, and compound 25 displayed significantly less

metabolic liability. In addition, these compounds maintained or improved their lipophilic ligand efficiency (LLE), which is a measure of potency for lipophilicity (LLE=-logKi - ClogP) (Table 3).22 Although there was an improvement in intrinsic clearance and LLE, none of the compounds provided a significant improvement over compound 9. Our extensive SAR efforts confirmed that 9 possessed the most attractive attributes. Thus, compound 9 was put through a battery of in vivo behavioral models and shown to be efficacious. As designed by removing the hydrogen bond donor in compound 3 and replacing it with a methyl, 9 demonstrated improvements in CNS penetration. The brain to plasma ratio in a mouse increased from 0.21 to 0.86. In the conditioned avoidance response assay (CAR), 9 was active with an ED50 of 1 mg/kg (Figure 6) at a significantly lower total plasma exposure (115 nM) than compound 3. It is highly protein bound, showing efficacy at a free plasma exposure of 0.3 nM. It was also inactive in the PDE10A knockout mice, providing evidence that the efficacy is mediated through PDE10A inhibition. The effects on cyclic nucleotide signaling in the striatum were measured with subcutaneous dosing of 9 in mice. The striatum section of the brain was chosen as the tissue due to the high expression levels of PDE10A. Administration of 9 to mice caused a dose dependent increase in striatal cGMP (Figure 7). The minimal effective dose (MED) was 1 mg/kg, which elevated cGMP 3 fold. The elevation in cGMP appears to plateau and displays a maximal elevation of approximately a 5-fold increase at 3.2 mg/kg.

In summary, structure-based drug design efforts utilized a novel binding pocket to identify a selective class of PDE10A inhibitors (Figure 9). This class possessed distinct physicochemical properties from the marketed PDE5 inhibitors, and this series was optimized for potency, selectivity, in vivo efficacy, CNS penetration, and pharmacokinetics to yield 9. It is a highly potent and selective PDE10A inhibitor with excellent in vivo efficacy in neurochemical elevation of cyclic nucleotides and in models predictive of antipsychotic activity. The preclinical pharmacokinetic properties were very promising. With the entry of 9 into clinical trials, we plan to determine if PDE10A inhibition can improve schizophrenic patient outcomes. Experimental Section

With 9 displaying efficacy in vivo, a high degree of PDE selectivity (>1000Â) and selectivity in the CEREP panel (>100Â), we explored its pharmacokinetic properties in multiple preclinical species (Figure 8). Overall, it displays low to moderate in vivo clearance with a moderate volume of distribution. Absorption of 9 following oral administration of a single dose was variable in preclinical species, with an absolute bioavailability of 30% in rats to 68-100% in dogs. This encouraging preclinical data together with the human in vitro ADME properties suggested that 9 would possess desirable drug-like human pharmacokinetic properties. Conclusion On the basis of the exciting preclinical data, 9 has entered clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia.23 It is the first reported clinical entry for this exciting new mechanism.
