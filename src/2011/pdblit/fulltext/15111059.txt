Abstract Osmotically inducible protein C (OsmC) is involved in the cellular defense mechanism against oxidative stress caused by exposure to hyperoxides or elevated osmolarity. OsmC was identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) analysis as a protein that is overexpressed in response to osmotic stress, but not under heat and oxidative stress. Here, an OsmC gene from T. kodakaraensis KOD1 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. TkOsmC showed a homotetrameric structure based on gel filtration and electron microscopic analyses. TkOsmC has a significant peroxidase activity toward both organic and inorganic peroxides in high, but not in low temperature. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Adaptation of living cells to various environmental stresses has been studied for many years with numerous eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. When environmental conditions change gradually, organisms can acclimate by sensing the changes and inducing expression of genes for the synthesis of large numbers of proteins and metabolites that are involved in resistance against environmental stress [1]. Since hyperthermophilic archaea have survived in extreme environments and have uniquely metabolic and physiological characteristics, they are used widely in the biotechnological

industry for diverse applications [2­4]. However, our current understanding of these organisms' adaptation mechanisms in response to stress is incomplete. Therefore further studies directed towards understanding the survival mechanisms of these organisms in extreme environments are needed. Focusing on this, we have analyzed the overexpression patterns of proteins subjected to various stress by 2-dimensional gel. Our results indicated that the OsmC protein was notably up-regulated by osmotic stress. Generally, peroxides are highly toxic and can damage cellular macromolecules in bacteria. Therefore, detoxification of peroxides is important for bacterial survival and proliferation in the host. The OsmC gene was first demonstrated from Escherichia coli in response to osmotic shock [5] and the resulting protein is referred to as osmotically inducible protein C. A number of bacterial species have one or two copies of this gene [6]. This gene is highly conserved in Bascillus (one copy), Mycoplasma (one copy), Xanthomonas (one copy), Pseudomonas (two copies) and Deinococcus (two copies) species. Regulation of this gene

has been revealed to be complex in both Bacillus subtilis [6] and E. coli [7]. Recently, the crystal structures of an OsmC from Mycoplasma pneumoniae and E. coli were reported and shown to have a dimeric structure, which is composed of two monomers arranged in a head-to-tail orientation [8,9]. Two conserved cysteines located in the region of dimer interface were identified [9]. In the present study, we identified OsmC protein overexpressed under only salt stress in Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 using a proteomic approach. The tetrameric structure of OsmC is revealed by gel filtration chromatography as well as electron microscopic analyses and it exhibits a peroxidase activity only in high temperature.
2. Experimental procedures 2.1. Microorganisms and media
T. kodakaraensis KOD1 which is kindly donated by Japan Collection of Microorganisms, RIKEN BioResource Center, Japan, was used to prepare crude cell extracts and isolate genomic DNA. It was cultured in the 280 Thermococcus medium [10,11].

2.5. MALDI-TOF MS analysis and protein identification
Samples for MALDI-TOF MS analysis were performed as described previously [13]. We used a Voyager TM-DE STR biospectrometry workstation (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The desired gel pieces were carefully excised and washed several times with 50 mM NH4HCO3 in 50% acetonitrile (ACN). After complete destaining, gel pieces were washed with water, shrunk by dehydration in ACN and reswollen in water. After removing supernatants, the gel pieces were dried in a Speedvac concentrator and rehydrated in a protease solution [50 mM NH4HCO3, 10% acetonitrile and trypsin (Promega; 20 g/ml)]. The resulting peptides were recovered by extraction with 50 mM NH4HCO3, 5% (v/v) formic acid and ACN, and samples were dried in a Speedvac concentrator. Dried peptides were dissolved in 5% formic acid and sonicated for 5 min in a bath-type sonicator. Peptide solutions were mixed with an equal volume of matrix solution consisting of saturated -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) in 50% ACN containing 0.1% TFA. Two microliters of sample was deposited on the MALDI plate, dried for 30 min at room temperature and rinsed with 5% formic acid followed by an additional washing with water. After drying at room temperature, the plate probe was inserted into the MALDI mass spectrometer. We performed searches in the NCBI, SwissProt/TrEMBL, and MSDB sequence databases using MS-Fit Mascot and ExPASy to identify proteins.

2.2. Preparation of crude cell extracts under heat, oxidative and osmotic stress shock
T. kodakaraensis KOD1 was first cultured under anaerobic conditions at 85 °C, after reaching mid-log phase, the cells were shocked by rapidly shifting the growth temperature into 95 °C for 1 h (for heat shock), by adding oxygen (5 L/min) for 30 min (for oxidative shock) or a final concentration of 1 M NaCl for 1 h (for osmotic shock), independently. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with PBS (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4 and 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4). Proteins were extracted by sonication in PBS. The soluble proteins were separated by centrifugation at 32,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C. Soluble proteins (200 g) were precipitated with 10% (w/v) TCA in acetone containing 0.07% (v/v) -mercaptoethanol for 45 min at - 20 °C. After precipitation, the samples were centrifuged at 32,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed with acetone containing 0.07% (v/v) -mercaptoethanol and centrifuged and dried in vacuum. The proteins were dissolved in isoelectric focusing (IEF) solvent (9 M urea, 100 mM DTT, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.5% (w/v) carrier ampholytes pH 4­7, 0.01% (w/v) bromophenol blue and 40 mM Tris). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using a commercial dye reagent (Bio-Rad Lab., Hercules, CA).

2.6. Cloning, expression and purification of the TkOsmC
DNA manipulation was performed by standard procedures, as described by Sambrook and Russell [14]. The TkOsmC gene was amplified from T. kodakaraensis KOD1 genomic DNA by PCR, and cloned into the pET-28a expression vector (Novagen). The primers (5-CAT ATG GTC AAA GGG GCA GTA AAG-3 and 5-CTC GAG TTA CTC ATC ATC AGG GAC TAT C-3) were designed based on the T. kodakaraensis KOD1 genome sequence found in the NCBI database. The expression of TkOsmC1 was induced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) plysS (Stratagene) by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl--galactopyranoside (IPTG), once cultures reached an O.D. of ~0.6 at 600 nm. After 4 h, the cells were harvested and resuspended with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl, 0.1 M KCl, 5 mM imidazole and 10% glycerol, pH 8.0). After disruption of cells by sonication, the sample was heated at 70 °C for 20 min. The heat-stable supernatant was separated by centrifugation and loaded onto a Profinity IMAC Ni-charged resin (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) which was preequilibrated with lysis buffer. TkOsmC eluted at around 100 mM imidazole. TkOsmC was further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) (Äkta FPLC system; Amersham Biosciences) on a Superdex 200 10 / 300 GL column (GE healthcare) equilibrated with 25 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.4) containing 500 mM NaCl. The purity of TkOsmC protein was examined by SDS-PAGE according to standard procedure [15].

2.3. 2DE analysis
IEF was performed using a ReadyStrip (11 cm, pH 4­7; Bio-Rad) in Protean IEF cell (Bio-Rad). The strips were rehydrated in a swelling solution (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 100 mM DTT, 0.5% IPG buffer and bromophenol blue) containing samples (100 or 500 g for silver-stained or Coomassie-stained gels, respectively) for 16 h at 20 °C at 50 V. The samples were isoelectrically focused at 250 V for 30 min, 1000 V for 1 h and then 8000 V for a total of 35,000 Vh/gel. After IEF, the strips were equilibrated for 15 min in buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.8, 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% DTT, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) for SDS-PAGE analysis, followed by 15 min equilibration in the same buffer containing 2% iodoacetamide. The strip gels were placed on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and sealed with 3% agarose solution. After electrophoresis, gels were then fixed in methanol/acetic acid (40% / 10% in distilled water) for 1 h [12]. Proteins were detected by silver-staining or Coomassie-staining.

2.7. Chemical cross-linking
To analyze oligomeric state of TkOsmC, chemical cross-linking was performed as described previously [16]. Briefly, purified TkOsmC in 25 mM Tris­ HCl (pH 7.4) containing 500 mM NaCl was incubated with 0.5 mM of disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 M Tris­HCl (pH 6.8). The sample was then mixed with SDSPAGE sample buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 staining.

2.8. Assay of peroxidase (Prx) activity
Prx activity was measured by the ferrous oxidation xylenol (FOX) method [17,18]. Incubation mixture (100 l of total volume) contained the following: 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mM DTT, TkOsmC protein and various concentrations of H2O2 and t-BOOH (tert-butyl hydroperoxide). After incubating samples at RT or 80 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of icecold FOX reagent and sample absorbance was measured at 560 nm. The amount

2.4. Protein visualization and image analysis
Stained gels were scanned and digitized using a Duoscan (Agfa) scanner. Images were then evaluated using PDQuest version 7.1 software (Bio-Rad). After identifying spots of interest, the gels were aligned, landmarked and matched.

[19]. Electron micrographs (EM) were recorded on Kodak film (SO163) at a nominal magnification of ×67,000. Light-optical diffractograms were used to select the micrographs, to examine the defocus, and to verify that no drift or astigmastism was present. Suitable areas were digitized as arrays of 1024 × 1024 pixels with Leaf Scan 45 at a pixel size of 20 m corresponding to 0.30 nm at specimen level. For image processing, the SEMPER [20] and EM [21] software packages were used. From digitized micrographs, smaller frames of 32 × 32 pixels containing individual particles were extracted interactively. These images were aligned translationally and rotationally using standard correlation methods [22,23]. For analyzing the rotational symmetry of top-on view images, the aligned images were subjected to multivariate statistical analysis [24]. The individual images were aligned translationally but not rotationally as described by Marco et al. [25]. The resulting eigenimages represent all important structural features of the original data set. If the images have different rotational symmetries in the original data set, the eigenimages reveal the different symmetry axes. Moreover, these images can be distinguished and subsequently separated based on eigenimages. The rotationally aligned images were classified based on eigenvector­eigenvalue data analysis, subsequent averaging was performed for each class separately.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Expression patterns of TkOsmC under heat, oxidative or osmotic shock In order to examine overexpression patterns of proteins in T. kodakaraensis KOD1 under various stresses, we used a proteomic approach combining 2DE and MALDI-TOF MS analyses. The overexpressed proteins under osmotic stress were different than those detected under heat or oxidative stress (data not shown). We detected that 42 up-regulated proteins were up-

2.9. Electron microscopy and image processing
The purified TkOsmC proteins in 25 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.4) containing 500 mM NaCl were applied to glow-discharged carbon coated copper grids. Allowing the protein to adsorb for 1­2 min, the grids were rinsed with deionized water and stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Specimens were examined in the FEI Technai-12 at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV using a low-dose unit

The origins of sequences are as follows: T. kodakaraensis KOD1 (TK; BAD84378); P. horikoshii OT3 (PH; NP_143334); P. abyssi GE5 (PAB; NP_126378); P. furiosus DSM 3638 (PF; NP_579117); Thermoplasma acidophilum (Ta; CAC12531); Thermoplasma volcanium GSS1 (TVN; NP_111949); Deinococcus radiodurans (DR; Q9RU56); Xanthomonas campestris pv.

regulated by osmotic shock. Among these were peroxidase proteins, proteins involved in compatible solute accumulation and DNA-regulation proteins (data not shown). The proteins involved in compatible solute accumulation play a role in equilibration of water pressure between the inside and outside of the cell. Although adaptation to osmotic shock is complex, accumulation of compatible compounds, different lipid compositions, and synthesis of new proteins are some examples [26]. Peroxides as toxic factors in the cell could be produced in this process. Therefore, peroxidase proteins were overexpressed and might play a significant role in defense against osmotic shock. Based on the proteomic analysis of osmotic stress treated cells, we found that the defense strategy of osmotic shock was different from that of heat and oxidative shock. As shown in Fig. 1, TkOsmC protein was only up-regulated under osmotic shock. Therefore, we were interested in OsmC, which is known as a protein that is highly up-regulated in response to osmotic shock. To elucidate how OsmC responds to osmotic shock, we cloned the OsmC gene from T. kodakaraensis KOD1 (TkOsmC). 3.2. Sequence homology of TkOsmC Searching databases for protein homology found TkOsmC (TK0189) to have a conserved domain shared with the OsmC family, which has peroxidase activity (Fig. 2). The OsmC family has two conserved cysteines from mesophilic and thermophilic organisms. Interestingly, T. kodakaraensis KOD1, hyperthermophilic archaeon, contains three cysteines at amino acid sequence positions 25, 47 and 112. The three cysteines are also found in other hyperthermophilic such as Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3, Pyrococcus abyssi GE5, and Pyrococcus furiosus DSM 3638 (Fig. 2). Some reports proposed the following reaction for Cys2nd and Cys3rd: a hydroperoxide reacts with the Cys2nd thiol group and is reduced to its corresponding alcohol. The Cys2nd is then oxidazed to cysteine-sulfenic acid (-SOH), which immediately forms a disulfide bond with Cys3rd, releasing a water molecule [9,28]. But, we cannot define a function for Cys25 at present. 3.3. TkOsmC oligomeric conditions In order to determine the oligomeric nature and molecular weight of TkOsmC, we performed gel filtration chromatography, native PAGE and chemical cross-linking (Fig. 3). All experiments were carried out in 25 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.4) containing 500 mM NaCl, which is salt concentration of growth media of T. kodakaraensis KOD1. Gel filtration chromatograph of TkOsmC under non-denaturing conditions showed the complex with mass of about 67 kDa, which corresponds to a tetramer with 16 kDa subunits (Fig. 3A). The tetrameric form of TkOsmC estimated by MW marker proteins exists as a predominant structure. The size of TkOsmC was confirmed by nativepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by Coomassie staining (Fig. 3C). However, the resulting gel had a band that appeared larger than 67 kDa of molecular weight standards. Protein mobility in native gel depends on both protein's charge and its hydrodynamic size [29]. Native TkOsmC was subjected at the pH of Laemmli's system, pH = 8.4, in this study. But this

(A) Purified TkOsmC was dialyzed with buffer containing 500 mM NaCl and loaded on Superdex 200 10 / 300 GL column (GE healthcare). (B) Purified proteins without (1) or with (2) DTT were subjected on non-reducing gel. (C) After gel filtration, protein was subjected to a 7% native gel for analysis.

protein's isoelectronic point (PI) is calculated to 5.85 by amino acid sequence and PI of bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) used as standard marker is 4.9. In case of Hip, cross-linking may also cause the mobility change of Hip complexes in SDS-PAGE [30]. Therefore this result may be due to the protein's charge strength (Fig. 3C). To further analyze the oligomeric nature of TkOsmC complex, TkOsmC were incubated with disuccinimidyl suberate, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE). Fig. 3D shows that the subunits of TkOsmC proteins are cross-linked into various intermediates corresponding to the sizes from monomers to tetramers. These results suggest that TkOsmC consists of four subunits under native conditions. To determine whether native TkOsmC forms inter- or intramolecular disulfide bonds we analyzed it over non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B). The result shows that TkOsmC is monomeric in the presence or absence of DTT, suggesting that it forms intramolecular disulfide bonds. 3.4. Observation of tetrameric structure of TkOsmC Gel filtration analysis under non-denaturing conditions showed that purified TkOsmC has a molecular mass of ~67 kDa, which

corresponds to a tetramer with 16 kDa subunits. This result is different from other homologous proteins, which consist of dimmers, as determined by X-ray crystallography [9,28]. In sequence homology and secondary structure prediction analyses, TkOsmC displays low identity to E. coli OsmC (data not shown). In order to clarify the oligomeric structure of TkOsmC, we performed electron microscopy (EM) analysis. The electron micrographs of the negatively stained TkOsmC complexes showed a uniform distribution of rectangular-shaped structures (Fig. 4A). A total of well stained 442 particles was translationally aligned and subjected to multivariate statistical analysis [25]. The resulting eigenimages represent all important structural feature of the original data set. The eigenimages obtained from translationally, but not rotationally, aligned images revealed the 4-fold rotational symmetry of the protein. Using the 10 most significant eigenvectors, 3 classes were discriminated according to the similarity of features after rotational alignment but without application of any symmetrization. The class averages revealed a rectangular-shaped structure with a 4-fold symmetry and heavy stain accumulation at its center (Fig. 4B). The averaged images of TkosmC showed four centers of mass arranged on a quadrangle with low density in its center (Fig. 4C). The dimension of TkOsmC and diameter of the center hole were approximately 6.0 nm × 7.2 nm and 2.0 nm respectively. These projected images as well as the gel filtration and cross-linking analyses indicated that TkOsmC proteins have a tetrameric rectangular-shaped structure as com-

pared with E. coli OsmC protein's suggested dimeric structure [9]. 3.5. Peroxidase activity of TkOsmC In order to investigate the physiological function of TkOsmC, we measured peroxidase activity of this protein in the absence or presence of DTT and at low or high temperature with a xylenol (FOX) assay (Fig. 5). Inorganic (H2O2) and organic hydroperoxides (t-BOOH) were independently incubated with TkOsmC in an enzyme concentration-dependent manner and the hydroperoxide concentration was monitored spectrophotometrically. As shown in Fig. 5, TkOsmC showed no detectable enzyme activity in the absence of reducing agent. In the presence of DTT, it has better decomposable hydroperoxides activity at high temperature (80 °C; physiological growth temperature of T. kodakaraensis KOD1) than at low temperature. In addition, the results show that TkOsmC can act as an organic and inorganic hydroperoxide peroxidase at high temperature, although the enzyme's chemical reaction to turnover substrates is different (i.e. H2O2 is converted into water; t-BOOH is converted into corresponding alcohol). These results are comparable to previous reports which E. coli OsmC evolved to detoxify organic peroxide substrates and not H2O2 [9]. Therefore, we suggest that TkOsmC might be able to metabolize both organic and inorganic hydroperoxides at growth temperature.
