The crystal structure at 2.7 Å resolution of histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS) from Thermus thermophilus in complex with its amino acid substrate histidine has been determined. In the crystal asymmetric unit there are two homodimers, each subunit containing 421 amino acid residues. Each monomer of the enzyme consists of three domains: (1) an N-terminal catalytic domain containing a sixstranded antiparallel -sheet and the three motifs common to all class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, (2) a 90-residue C-terminal R/ domain which is common to most class IIa synthetases and is probably involved in recognizing the anticodon stem-loop of tRNAHis, and (3) a HisRS-specific R-helical domain inserted into the catalytic domain, between motifs II and III. The position of the insertion domain above the catalytic site suggests that it could clamp onto the acceptor stem of the tRNA during aminoacylation. Two HisRS-specific peptides, 259-RGLDYY and 285-GGRYDG, are intimately involved in forming the binding site for the histidine, a molecule of which is found in the active site of each monomer. The structure of HisRS in complex with histidyl adenylate, produced enzymatically in the crystal, has been determined at 3.2 Å resolution. This structure shows that the HisRS-specific Arg-259 interacts directly with the R-phosphate of the adenylate on the opposite side to the usual conserved motif 2 arginine. Arg259 thus substitutes for the divalent cation observed in seryl-tRNA synthetase and plays a crucial catalytic role in the mechanism of histidine activation.

ABSTRACT:

The fidelity of protein biosynthesis is dependent on the correct charging of tRNAs with their cognate amino acids. This reaction, which occurs in two steps, is catalyzed by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) which specifically recognize both the amino acid and its cognate tRNA(s) as well as the ATP required for the initial amino acid activation [for reviews see Cusack (1995) and Delarue (1995)]. These enzymes are divided into two distinct classes which are distinguishable on the basis of sequence comparisons as well as three-dimensional structure (Eriani et al., 1990; Cusack et al., 1990). The catalytic domain of class I aaRSs comprises a five-stranded parallel -sheet with connecting helices, referred to as the nucleotide binding (Rossmann) fold, which is also found in a number of functionally unrelated enzymes. Class II enzymes have a catalytic domain built around a six-stranded antiparallel -sheet (Cusack et al., 1990), a similar fold having been identified only in biotin synthetase (Artymiuk et al., 1994). In class I aaRS the conserved, class-defining, sequence motifs KMSKS and HIGH are responsible for the interaction with the universal substrate ATP and for assisting catalysis, whereas in class II synthetases it is residues of the so-called motifs 2 and 3 that play this role, notably an absolutely conserved arginine from each motif. Another class II defining motif,

motif 1, characterized by an almost conserved proline, is responsible for dimer interactions in class II aaRS. The three-dimensional structures of 11 different synthetases have been determined (Cusack et al., 1995): from class I, MetRS (Brunie et al., 1990) and GlnRS from Escherichia coli (Rould et al., 1989), GluRS from Thermus thermophilus (Nureki et al., 1995), and TyrRS (Brick et al., 1989) and TrpRS (Doublie et al., 1995) from Bacillus ´ stearothermophilus, and from class II, SerRS from both the E. coli and T. thermophilus systems (Fujinaga et al., 1993), HisRS from E. coli (Arnez et al., 1995), GlyRS from T. thermophilus (Logan et al., 1995), AspRS from both Saccharomyces cereVisiae (Ruff et al., 1991) and T. thermophilus (Delarue et al., 1994; Poterszman et al., 1994), LysRS from both E. coli (Onesti et al., 1995) and T. thermophilus (Cusack et al., 1996b), and PheRS from T. thermophilus (Mosyak et al., 1995). Structural information for the synthetase in complex with its cognate tRNA is available for the Glu (Rould et al., 1989), Asp (Ruff et al., 1991), Ser (Biou et al., 1994; Cusack et al., 1996a), and Lys systems (Cusack et al., 1996b). The structural basis of amino acid and ATP recognition and the mechanism of activation have been described in detail for the class II aspartyl- (Cavarelli et al., 1994) and seryl(Belrhali et al., 1995) enzymes and the class I glutaminyl(Perona et al., 1994) enzyme. Differences in the observed magnesium binding sites in the case of the two class II synthetases suggest that different enzymes might differ in detail in their active centers (Belrhali et al., 1995). Histidyl-tRNA synthetase is one of smallest class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases with an homodimeric structure and subunit molecular mass of about 47 kDa in prokaryotic systems. A number of distinctive features make the histidyl system of particular interest. It is classified as a member of subclass IIa primarily because of the presence of a putative

Activation of Histidine by Histidyl-tRNA Synthetase anticodon binding C-terminal domain which is homologous to that of threonyl-, prolyl-, and some glycyl-tRNA synthetases (Cusack et al., 1991; Cusack, 1995). On the other hand, sequence alignments show it to be otherwise distinct from other class IIa synthetases (Cusack et al., 1991). In particular, there are two peptides preceding motif 3 (RGLDYY and GGRYDGL) which are highly conserved in all known HisRS sequences, the second of which is also found in the histidyl-tRNA synthetase-like domain of yeast GCN2 (Wek et al., 1989). Histidine-specific tRNAs are unique for the additional guanosine (designated G-1) present at their 5 end, giving rise through pairing with the discriminator base (C73 in prokaryotes and organelles, A73 or G73 in eukaryotes) to an extra base pair in the acceptor stem (Steinberg et al., 1993). As shown by in Vitro aminoacylation of transcripts, the G-1,C73 base pair in E. coli is the most important determinant for HisRS (Himeno et al., 1989). Furthermore, minihelices corresponding to the acceptor stem and TC loop of tRNAHis are efficiently aminoacylated by HisRS (Franklyn & Schimmel, 1990; Franklyn et al., 1992). More recently, in ViVo studies have shown that the identity of histidine tRNAs in E. coli depends more on C73 than G-1 (Yan et al., 1994). On the other hand, in the yeast histidyl system, the exact nature of the additional base pair seems less important (except that G73 is a strong negative determinant), suggesting that the major recognition elements may be the extra backbone groups at the 5 end (Nameki et al., 1995). As far as specific recognition of the GUG anticodon goes, in Vitro results suggest that in the E. coli system the anticodon bases are weak identity elements whereas in the yeast system bases 34 and 35, but not 36, are relatively more important (Nameki et al., 1995). The manner of binding of the C-terminal domain of class IIa synthetases to the anticodon stem-loop is one of the remaining open structural questions about this subclass of synthetases. We have previously reported the purification and cocrystallization of HisRS from T. thermophilus (HisRSTT) with histidine (Yaremchuk et al., 1995). Here we describe the structure of the HisRSTT-histidine complex determined at 2.7 Å resolution which reveals the overall architecture of the enzyme as well as details of the recognition of the amino acid substrate. In addition, we have determined the structure of the complex of HisRSTT with histidyl adenylate at 3.2 Å resolution, obtained after soaking the original crystals with Mn2+ and ATP. The two structures reported here show high similarity to that of the E. coli HisRS complexed with histidyl adenylate (Arnez et al., 1995). The particularly new information provided by this work comprises (a) the sequence and structure of a thermostable HisRS, (b) visualization of the insertion domain, disordered in the E. coli HisRS structure, and (c) based on the structures of the histidine complex and the histidyl adenylate complex formed in situ by addition of ATP, a more complete structural description of the activation step. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning and Sequencing of T. thermophilus HisRS. The hisS gene of T. thermophilus HisRS has been isolated from genomic DNA obtained from T. thermophilus HB 27 cells. The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal 43 residues, determined by protein sequencing, together with highly

Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 11, 1997 3085 conserved regions of HisRS was used to define several oligonucleotides as primers for PCR. Two oligonucleotides, corresponding to the first six N-terminal residues and a conserved heptapeptide in the central part of protein, were used to select a single DNA fragment of 850 bp by means of the PCR (Yaremchuk et al., unpublished results). That this corresponded to a putative HisRS gene was verified by cloning and DNA sequencing. The cloned fragment was then used as a probe for Southern blot hybridization to T. thermophilus chromosomal DNA digested with several restriction enzymes. A 2.5 kb HindIII/BamHI fragment was cloned into pUC18 plasmid and sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide method (Sanger et al., 1977). The open reading frame of the hisS gene contains 1263 bp, from which the sequence of the 421 amino acid residues comprising the subunit was deduced. Crystallization. Crystals of histidyl-tRNA synthetase were grown from protein purified from T. thermophilus using ammonium sulfate as precipitant, with the substrate histidine present in the crystallization solution (Yaremchuk et al., 1995). The crystals belong to the space group P21212 with cell dimensions a ) 171.3 Å, b ) 214.7 Å, c ) 49.3 Å, and R ) )  ) 90°. There are four monomers per asymmetric unit and approximately 45% of the crystal volume is occupied by solvent. Diffraction Measurements. Data on the native crystals were collected on the high brilliance beamline ID2 (BL4) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) using a 30 cm Mar-Research image plate detector. A complete native data set to 2.7 Å resolution was collected on a single flash-frozen crystal at 100 K using a 0.7° rotation to avoid spot overlap. The exposure time was 20 s per image. The data are essentially complete with an Rsym on intensities of 5% (Table 1). Heavy atom derivatives obtained using compounds containing Hg, Au, U, and Pb were used to determine the HisRS structure. Native crystals were soaked 24 h in solutions of the mother liquor containing either 1 mM HgCl2, 1 mM KAuCl4, 1 mM uranyl acetate, or 20 mM trimethyllead acetate, respectively. Data were collected to 4 Å resolution for the U and Pb soaked crystals and to 2.9 Å for the Au and Hg soaked crystals. All data were collected at ID2 (BL4), ESRF. Typical exposure times were 10-20 s/deg. Two independent data sets, respectively on beamline ID9 (BL3) and beamline ID2 (BL4) at the ESRF, have been collected on single crystals which prior to freezing were soaked for 30 min in mother liquor containing 10 mM ATP and 10 mM Mn2+. The data are of poorer quality than the native due to crystal deterioration upon soaking but are complete to 3.2 Å resolution with some data to 2.8 Å in the ID9 data collection (Table 1). Structure Determination. All processing was done using the CCP4 program package (1994). The structure of HisRS was determined by the method of multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR). The mercury sites were located by both automated (RSPS) and manual Patterson techniques and refined with MLPHARE. The resulting phases were used to determine the heavy atom positions in the other derivatives by difference Fourier methods. The MIR phases, calculated with all four derivatives, had an overall mean figure of merit of 0.62 for the centric reflections and 0.40 for the acentric for data in the resolution range 20-3 Å. Phases were improved by solvent flattening and 4-fold averaging using

ment with tight geometrical and NCS restraints, difference maps showed clear density for the histidyl adenylate (Figure 3b), the reordered motif 2 loop, and other small changes. Inclusion of histidyl adenylate in the model, but not water molecules, led to a current R-factor (Rfree) of 26% (30%) (see Table 2). RESULTS Sequence and OVerall Structure of T. thermophilus HisRS. The primary structure of HisRSTT that we have derived from the gene sequence is shown in Figure 1 aligned to five other prokaryotic HisRS. The T. thermophilus enzyme is composed of 2 × 421 amino acid residues with a total molecular mass of 96 kDa. HisRSTT is 37% identical in sequence to the corresponding enzyme from E. coli whose structure is already known (Arnez et al., 1995). The structure of HisRSTT was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement using four heavy atom derivatives (Table 1). The asymmetric unit contains two complete dimers which was used to improve the electron density maps by 4-fold averaging of the electron density. Using the primary structure of HisRSTT which we have derived from the gene sequence, a model has been refined with X-PLOR (Brunger, 1991) at 2.7 Å resolution using noncrystallographic restraints. The final model shows good stereochemistry with an overall R ) 22% and Rfree ) 28% for all reflections. Further details are given in Materials and Methods and Tables 1 and 2. The overall structure of a monomer and dimer of HisRSTT is shown in Figure 2, and the derived secondary structure is superposed on the sequence alignment in Figure 1. The structure is very similar to that already described for the same enzyme from E. coli (Arnez et al., 1995; see Figure 1 in this paper for a schematic diagram of the secondary structure). The HisRSTT subunit contains three domains: the catalytic domain common to all class II synthetases, the C-terminal domain most likely involved in binding the tRNA anticodon stem-loop, and a third R-helical domain inserted into the catalytic domain between motifs 2 and 3. The C-terminal domain is connected to the catalytic domain via an extended chain of nine residues (321-329). In the dimer, the C-terminal domain of one subunit makes interactions exclusively with the catalytic domain of the other subunit (Figure 2b). The Catalytic Domain. The catalytic domain, residues 2-171 and 229-320, is based around a seven-stranded

the program DM. Maps calculated at 3 Å resolution with solvent-flattened MIR phases clearly showed the characteristic -sheet of class II synthetases. All model building was done using the program O (Jones et al., 1995). Refinement of the Histidine Complex. The initial model had an Rcryst of 0.48 for all data. The structure was refined using X-PLOR (Brunger, 1993) with the protein parameters ¨ defined by Engh and Huber (1991). Initially, strict noncrystallographic constraints between the four monomers were used. After several rounds of simulated annealing, positional refinement, and rebuilding, tight noncrystallographic restraints (except for restricted regions) were used instead of strict non-crystallographic constraints. During the final stages of refinement water molecules were inserted into the model using peaks in the Fo - Fc maps. Waters with B-factors above 80 Å2 were excluded from the model. Solvent corrections were included during the refinement as implemented in X-PLOR using a small solvent radius of 0.25 Å. The course of the refinement was checked by the 5% of reflections left out from the beginning and used to calculate an Rfree. The final model has an Rfactor of 22.0% and Rfreeof 27.7% using all data to 2.7 Å resolution. This model comprises 4 × 420 residues (the N-terminal methionine is not visible), 283 water molecules, four histidines, and four sulfate ions (Table 2). The Ramachandran plot for the final model shows that more than 91% of the residues are in the most favored regions and that only two residues, in poorly ordered zones, are in disallowed regions. Refinement of the Histidyl Adenylate Complex. The refined model of the HisRSTT-histidine complex, but with the histidine and all water molecules removed, was used as the starting point for the refinement of the histidyl adenylate complex. After rigid-body refinement and positional refine-

-sheet, six of the strands being antiparallel ( 5, 6, 11, 10, 9, 7), surrounded by three long R-helices, the normal class II interface (R1) and crossover (R5) helices and an extra helix (R6) specific for HisRS which is involved with the interface with the C-terminal domain (see below). The six antiparallel strands form the basis for the class II catalytic domain. The seventh -strand ( 8) is parallel to 7 in HisRSTT, which is also the case for class IIb synthetases (AspRS, LysRS) but not SerRS where this strand is antiparallel and can be considered as part of the N-terminal extension of that synthetase. The Subunit Interface. There are two major components to the intersubunit interface, first, between the two catalytic domains, and second, between the C-terminal domain of one subunit and the catalytic domain of the other. The interface between the two catalytic domains is mediated as in other class II synthetases by the N-terminal part of the catalytic domain including notably motif 1. An intersubunit sheet is formed by 0 making two hydrogen bonds with the antiparallel strand 1 (where the prime indicates the second subunit), and although the antiparallel loop formed by 3 and 4 crosses over toward the other subunit close to the dimer 2-fold axis, there are, surprisingly, no intersubunit hydrogen bonds with the corresponding loop in the other subunit ( 3 and 4), thus not forming the cross-subunit four-

stranded antiparallel -sheet as is the case in most other class II synthetases described. Furthermore, in HisRSTT the axes of the long interface helices (R1) of motif 1, antiparallel about the dimer 2-fold axis, are 17 Å apart, too far for their side chains to interact directly as occurs in seryl-tRNA synthetase or class IIb synthetases where the helix axis separation is respectively about 12 and 10 Å. The only interhelix bridging interaction is by Arg-28 on one helix interacting with Glu38 on the loop after the same helix which in turn interacts with Gln-21 on the symmetry-related helix. The consequence is that between these two helices, penetrating the dimer, there is a deep solvent-filled crevice which includes a very well-defined sulfate ion bound to each interface helix by Arg-18 and Arg-22. The floor of the crevice is formed by a more substantial hydrophobic interface between the subunits as described for the similar HisRSEC [see Figure 3 in Arnez et al. (1995)]. In this region there is a close connection between the two active sites via the highly conserved motif 1 proline-42, similar to that described in detail for the aspartyl system (Eriani et al., 1993). The extreme N-terminus of HisRSTT (residues 2-5) also packs on the symmetry-related subunit (Figure 1b) making two inter-subunit hydrogen bonds. The two subunits are also held together by the C-terminal domain of one subunit which has an extensive interface with

the catalytic domain of the other subunit. This interaction is mediated by the first helix (R13) and following strand ( 13) of the C-terminal domain which pack against the C-terminal end of the interface helix (R1), the crossover helix (R5), and the C-terminal end of the extra catalytic domain helix (R6). The crossover helix is in fact parallel to the first helix (R13) of the C-terminal domain, and the two interact for instance by means of respectively Glu-142 and Arg352, both residues being highly conserved in all HisRS sequences. The Histidine Binding Site. Crystals of HisRSTT could only be grown in the presence of histidine, present in the crystallization medium at a concentration of 5 mM. The solvent-flattened MIR maps show a well-defined electron density at the active site corresponding to a bound histidine which is present in all four monomers (Figure 3a). The active site of HisRS is overall similar in arrangement to other class II synthetases of known structure although there are several significant differences in detail (Figure 4). Residues fulfilling their expected function are the conserved arginines of motif 2 and motif 3, respectively Arg-112 and Arg-311, and the conserved Phe-124 which stacks with the adenine ring of the adenylate (see below). The motif 2 loop, residues 115-120, is poorly ordered in the presence of the histidine only, consistent with the fact that in other class II

synthetases it has been shown to be stabilized only by interactions with the adenine ring of the ATP or adenylate [e.g., Belrhali et al. (1994)] and/or with the tRNA (Cusack et al., 1996). Features specific to HisRSs are the particular construction of the histidine-binding pocket and the residues found at the R-phosphate catalytic center (see section on adenylate). The histidine binding pocket is formed by two highly conserved peptides, denoted histidine-1 and histidine-2 in Figure 1. The first sequence, histidine-1 (258-VRGLDYY) makes a loop between 8 and 9 that covers the active site and forms the roof of the histidine binding pocket (Figure 4). In other class II synthetases this loop does not cover the active site to such an extent and the residues do not interact with the substrate. The second HisRS specific sequence (283-GGGGRYDG) forms a -strand under the histidine substrate ending with Tyr-288, whose side chain forms the side of the histidine pocket. Tyr-288 occupies the structurally equivalent position as the critical glutamic acid (arginine) recognizing the lysine (aspartic acid) in respectively LysRS (Onesti et al., 1995) and AspRS (Poterszman et al., 1994). The glycine-rich strand under the histidine is unusual in that though it is part of an antiparallel -sheet, it is virtually unpleated with all , angles within 180 ( 16°. The second two glycines are conserved in all HisRS, in particular Gly-285 being essential to avoid a steric

clash with the substrate histidine. In the histidine-2 peptide, the highly conserved Arg-287 and Asp-289 form a salt bridge on the other side of the main chain to Tyr-288 and thus help to lock the correct backbone conformation. Arg-287 also interacts closely with Asp-140, a highly conserved residue in the crossover helix R5. The only current exception to the absolute conservation of these two residues is in HisRSMG where the equivalent residues are respectively valine and phenylalanine, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions have replaced electrostatic interactions at this point in HisRSMG (Figure 1). Details of the interaction of the enzyme with the substrate histidine are shown in Figures 4a and 5a. The pocket in which histidine binds is highly polar with an extensive array of hydrogen bonds which prevent any hydrophobic amino acid from binding. Histidine specificity is ensured by Glu130 (motif 2) and Tyr-264 (histidine-1) which form hydrogen bonds respectively to the NE2 and ND1 positions of the histidine ring. Glu-130 is positioned by hydrogen bonds with Asn-128 and Tyr-288. Similarly, Arg-259 can hydrogen bond to the carboxyl group of the amino acid substrate as well as hydrogen bonding to and positioning Tyr-264. This implies that the ND1 of the substrate is deprotonated in order to be a hydrogen bond acceptor for the hydroxyl hydrogen of Tyr-264. These residues form part of a very striking chain of hydrogen-bonded residues extending right across the active site and comprising Ser-280/His-272/Glu-270/Arg-259/Tyr-

264. The absolutely conserved residues Glu-81 and Thr-83 from the "TXE loop" (for HisRS, this is in fact an "EGT" loop) common to all class II synthetases (Belrhali et al., 1994) both play important roles. Thr-83 interacts with the histidine N-terminus while Glu-81 makes a stabilizing hydrogen bond with Tyr-263, which also interacts with the histidine N-terminus. Comparison of the active sites of HisRSTT and HisRSEC (Arnez et al., 1995; Figure 6c) shows some minor differences in the substrate interactions between the two enzymes. Residues that differ in the hydrogen bonding between the two structures are (E. coli numbering in brackets) Glu-81 (83), Thr-83 (85), Tyr-263 (263), and Asn-128 (Gly-129). These differences may reflect the fact that the HisRSTT complex is with histidine, the HisRSEC complex being with histidyl adenylate (although adenylate formation does not change these interactions in HisRSTT; see below) or, more likely, the species difference that HisRSTT has an extra active site interacting residue (Asn-128 which replaces Gly129 in HisRSEC). C-Terminal Domain. HisRSTT contains a C-terminal domain of about 90 residues (330-421) connected to the catalytic domain via a extended chain of 9 residues and very similar to that found in E. coli HisRS (Arnez et al., 1995). It is a five-stranded mixed -sheet, with three flanking R-helices and a fourth short helix (R15) in the turn between antiparallel strands 14 and 15 (Figures 1 and 2). As

described above, the C-terminal domain of one subunit packs entirely against the catalytic domain the other subunit. Figure 6 shows that after superposition of catalytic domins there are slight variations in the position of the C-terminal domain among the four independent monomers in the structure, involving largely rigid body movements with average RMS displacements of 0.86, 1.01, and 1.38 Å (respectively for the a, c, and d monomers, compared to the b monomer). The five-stranded mixed -sheet has also been found in the C-terminal domain of the glycyl-tRNA synthetase (Logan et al., 1995). However, in this enzyme the domain is differently orientated and packs against the catalytic domain of both subunits. The location of this domain with respect to the catalytic domain is analogous to the N-terminal anticodon binding domain of AspRS, strongly suggesting that it is involved in anticodon stem-loop binding and recognition (see Discussion). A search through the database of known structures using DEJAVU (G. Kleijwegt and A. Jones) did not identify any other protein domain with a similar fold. On the other hand, there are now known several other RNA binding domains of about 90 residues, such as the RNP, KH, and dsRBD, each of which has a slightly different R/ topology (Nagai, 1996). Insertion Domain. Class II synthetases frequently possess a variable additional domain inserted into the catalytic domain between motifs 2 and 3 (Cusack et al., 1995), with the exception for the glycyl system where it is found between motifs 1 and 2 (Logan et al., 1995). In HisRSTT, we

consider the insertion domain to be the 60 residues between 169 and 230. The following region from 231 to 264 is also specific to histidyl-tRNA synthetases but structurally forms part of the catalytic domain. The electron density for the insertion domain is in general weak, and the side chains have relatively high B-factors. Only in one of the four subunits could the chain be traced in the solvent-flattened MIR maps. It was not before the later stages in the refinement that the insertion domain for all subunits was included in the model since they do not satisfy the same noncrystallographic symmetry operators as the catalytic domain (Figure 6). It should be noted that this domain was completely disordered in the structure of HisRS from E. coli (Arnez et al., 1995). The insertion domain consists of four R-helices (R6-9) which form a compact domain joined to the catalytic domain by a putative hinge formed by the close proximity of the ingoing and outgoing domain connections. The suggestion of a flexibily linked domain is reinforced by the narrow connection to the catalytic domain, the slightly different orientation in each subunit (Figure 6), and the fact that there are extremely few intimate contacts with the catalytic domain. The position of the insertion domain just above the active site strongly suggests that its function is to assist tRNA binding by clamping onto the acceptor stem of the tRNA (see Discussion). The Histidyl Adenylate Complex. Two independent data sets to 3.2 Å have been collected on crystals which prior to freezing were soaked in 10 mM ATP and 10 mM Mn2+

Activation of Histidine by Histidyl-tRNA Synthetase

Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 11, 1997 3091 can be attributed to the divalent cation Mn2+ that was added with the ATP. Even at 3.2 Å resolution, this ion should be clearly visible were it still associated with the histidyl adenylate, as was found in the seryl adenylate case (Belrhali et al., 1995). The detailed interactions with the histidyl adenylate are shown in Figures 4b and 5b, the interactions with the histidine moiety being essentially unchanged from those described above. Most significant is the fact that the R-phosphate of the histidyl adenylate is bound on each side by the motif 2 Arg-112 and the HisRS-specific Arg-259. The latter is in a position equivalent to that occupied by the divalent cation in the SerRS/ATP and SerRS/Ser adenylate complexes (Belrhali et al., 1995). On the other hand, the highly conserved glutamic acid residue that in most other class II synthetases binds the divalent cation and hydrogen bonds to the ribose O3 (Belrhali et al., 1994, 1995) is absent in HisRS. This interaction is replaced by a putative hydrogen bond between the O3 of the ribose and the carbonyl oxygen of Ala-281. There is also, as in the E. coli case, an extra hydrogen bond between the ribose O4 and Gln-126, not found, for instance, in seryl-tRNA synthetase. DISCUSSION The crystal structure of HisRS from T. thermophilus complexed with either histidine and histidyl adenylate is very similar to that of E. coli complexed with histidyl adenylate (Arnez et al., 1995), but reveals in addition the fold of the insertion domain that was disordered in the case of E. coli HisRS. The structure confirms the crucial role of the HisRSspecific peptides 259-RGLDYY and 285-GGRYDG in forming a specificity pocket in which the substrate histidine is buried. The fact that both the E. coli (Francklyn et al., 1994) and T. thermophilus (Yaremchuk et al., 1995) enzymes require the presence of histidine for crystallization suggests that a conformational change occurs upon histidine binding, i.e., that the binding site might be formed by an induced-fit mechanism involving the stabilization of the histidine-1 peptide. The structures presented above raise three interesting questions: (a) What is the mechanism of histidine activation? (b) How does the synthetase bind tRNAHis? (c) What conformational changes are associated with the overall aminoacylation reaction? Although the current structures do not answer these questions directly, they permit relevant observations to be made on each point. (a) Mechanism of Histidine ActiVation. The first step in the overall aminoacylation reaction is activation of the amino acid by ATP leading to the aminoacyl adenylate, a stable enzyme-bound intermediate. This is generally believed to occur via an in-line displacement mechanism following nucleophilic attack by the carboxyl group of the amino acid on the R-phosphate of the ATP. Structure-based reaction mechanisms for activation have been described for both class I and class II synthetases (Perona et al., 1993; Cavarelli et al., 1994; Belrhali et al., 1995). For instance, for the seryl system the pentavalent transition state is proposed to be stabilized by the conserved motif II arginine, found in all class II synthetases, and a divalent cation (magnesium or manganese) bound between the R- and -phosphates of the ATP and two protein ligands (Glu-345 and Ser-348 in SerRSTT). An equivalent divalent cation site cannot exist

Putative hydrogen bonds are shown in dotted lines if the distance between the acceptor and donor is less than 3.2 Å. A wiggly line indicates stacking interactions.

(Table 1). The resolution and quality of these data are reduced compared to the native data due to the deterioration of the crystals upon soaking. Due to nonisomorphism the data sets could not be merged, but each data set individually leads to the same conclusions as described below. A difference Fourier map calculated using the accurate phases from the refined model of HisRS shows strong positive density in each active site into which a histidyl adenylate molecule can clearly be fitted, indicating that the activation reaction has occurred in the crystal (Figure 3b). The histidine binding pocket is essentially unchanged upon adenylate formation. On the other hand, as expected from results on other class II synthetases, there is an ordering of the motif 2 loop backbone (residues 115-120) into a -hairpin conformation due to its main-chain interactions with the adenosine moiety of the adenylate which is stacked between the conserved motif 2 Phe-124 and motif 3 Arg-311. Consistently in each active site there is strong, elongated positive density, adjacent to the conserved motif 3 Arg-311 and Arg-120 of the motif 2 loop which is possibly residual pyrophosphate that has been produced by the activation reaction in the crystal (Figure 3b). There is no density that

FIGURE 6: Superposition of the CR traces of the four independent monomers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, after using only the catalytic domains for alignment. Both the C-terminal and insertion domains have significant, largely rigid body displacements. For the C-terminal domains the average RMS (maximum) displacements are 1.01 (2.49), 1.38 (3.36), and 0.86 (1.25) Å, respectively, for the a, c, and d monomers, compared to the b monomer. For the insertion domains the average RMS (maximum) displacements are 1.96 (3.48), 2.62 (4.48), and 2.18 (3.59) Å, respectively, for the a, c, and d monomers, compared to the b monomer.

in HisRS since, first, the two protein ligands become respectively Ala-281 and Gly-284 in HisRSTT and, second, the guanidinium group of the HisRS-specific Arg-259 occupies virtually the same position as the divalent cation in SerRS. Arg-259 is close to the histidine carboxyl group or the R-phosphate of the histidyl adenylate in the two complexes described above. It is thus reasonable to propose that this residue plays a catalytic role in HisRS analogous to that proposed for the divalent cation in SerRS. Arg-259, together with the conserved motif 2 Arg-112, would thus be responsible for initial neutralization of the negative charge of the histidine carboxyl group and stabilization of the doubly charged pentavalent transition state. There is no electron density that can be unambiguously assigned to a divalent cation, which might for instance correspond to either of the two additional ions on either side of the - and -phosphates that are observed in the SerRSTT-ATP complex (Belrhali et al., 1995). Higher resolution data on a complex with ATP or an ATP analogue and divalent cations would be required to confirm the location or absence of any divalent cation binding site. Magnesium is required for the overall histidine aminoacylation reaction in HisRSTT (A. Yaremchuk, unpublished results) although its importance for the activation step has not yet been studied. These results show that although the arrangement of the ATP and amino acid substrates is essentially the same in the three class II synthetase active sites for which structural data exit (AspRS, Cavarelli et al., 1994; SerRS, Belrhali et al., 1995; and HisRS), they differ in the manner in which extra positive charge is provided close to the catalytic center. (b) tRNA Binding. Figure 7a shows the electrostatic potential of the dimer. An extended positive potential surface running diagonally from the active site to the C-terminal domain of the same monomer can be seen which could be important in recognizing the negatively charged tRNA backbone. Using structural knowledge of the mode of binding of cognate tRNA to yeast AspRS (Ruff et al., 1991) and SerRSTT (Cusack et al., 1996) we have modeled a tRNA

molecule docked to the HisRSTT dimer (Figure 7b), an excercise also carried out in the case of E. coli HisRS (Arnez et al., 1995). Despite the obvious limitations in such a docking model, a number of points can be made. First, based on the consistent orientation with which tRNAs enter the class II active site, and the fact that the C-terminal domain of HisRS occupies the same spatial position as the N-terminal domain of yeast AspRS, it is evident that the tRNAHis will bind with its anticodon stem-loop in contact with the C-terminal domain of the same subunit as where the 3 end enters the active site, in agreement with the electrostatic potential surface. While the bulk of the interactions of the tRNA would thus be with the same HisRS subunit, the docking model suggests that the loop 96-98 from the other subunit could interact with the tRNA in the region of nucleotides 10-11. As suggested by the electrostatic surface, there are a large number of conserved basic residues that could contact tRNA backbone phosphates. The docking model suggests in particular that the insertion domain residues Arg-204, Arg-197, and Lys-209, conserved in all prokaryotic HisRSs (Figure 1), are well positioned to interact with phosphates 73-75 on the 3 strand backbone. Also the absolutely conserved residue Arg-7 (from the N-terminal strand which packs on the other subunit), together with Arg74 (on the other subunit), could interact with the tRNA backbone in the region of P67. These putative backbone interactions would help to explain the strong binding of acceptor stem minihelices to HisRS (Francklyn et al., 1992). Most interesting is the question of which elements are responsible for the specific recognition of the critical additional G-1,C73 base pair. As with other class II synthetases (Cusack et al., 1996), the variable motif 2 loop (115-RPQK in HisRSTT) is most likely interacting inside the major groove of the tRNA acceptor stem, with Gln-117, conserved in all prokaryotic HisRS, being well placed to make base-specific contacts with G-1,C73 or G1,C72. In addition, as also proposed by Arnez et al. (1995), the loop between 9 and 10 containing Gln-269, which is reasonably

Activation of Histidine by Histidyl-tRNA Synthetase

Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 11, 1997 3093 largely involved in the interface to the catalytic domain of the other subunit. This is consistent with the docking model which suggests that it is the second half of the C-terminal domain that could interact best with the tRNA. In particular, the helix R14 is in a position to bind to the anticodon stemloop from the major groove side, and exposed residues on strands 14 (e.g., Phe-383), 15 (e.g., Lys-397), and 16 (e.g., Gln-404) could interact with the anticodon loop nucleotides. It is interesting to note that, in HisRSTT, Phe383 and Gln-404 are juxtaposed in a very similar way to the conserved glutamine and phenylalanine that interact with U-35 in class IIb synthetases [see Cusack et al. (1996b)]. (c) Role of the Insertion Domain and the Dynamics of Aminoacylation. The insertion domain is poised over the active site in a way that it could clamp onto the tRNA. Basic residues Arg197, Arg204, and Lys209 as well as Asp-207, conserved in all prokaryotic HisRSs, are pointing toward the active site, making it possible for them to interact with the 3 strand backbone of the tRNA acceptor stem (see above). Furthermore, a slight movement of the insertion domain toward the active site would allow good van der Waals contact between otherwise exposed hydrophobic residues Met-203 and Met-225 in the insertion domain and the conserved Val-258 in the critical histidine-1 peptide as well as complementary electrostatic interactions between charged residues on the insertion domain (e.g., Arg-172 and Glu196) with catalytic domain residues (e.g., Asp-262 on the histidine-1 peptide or Asp-59 and Arg-62 in R3). Some of these interactions are seen in the four different monomers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit due to the slightly different positions of the insertion domain. The putative closing of the insertion domain over the tRNA poses a serious problem about what triggers the release of the histidyl-tRNA, since the histidine would be essentially deeply buried within the active site. In this connection it should be mentioned that modeling the 3 end of the tRNA into the active site of the histidyl adenylate complex can be done satisfactorily, placing the 3-OH of ribose-76 adjacent to the carbonyl group of the adenylate. However, the space available for the A-76 base is rather limited although it probably fits into a hydrophobic pocket formed by conserved hydrophobic residues in the region of helices R2 and R3 (e.g., Phe-50, Val-54, Ile-60, and Met-65 as well as Pro-80; see Figure 1). Note that this is the same conserved region containing charged residues that could also interact with the insertion domain (see above). These observations suggest that either tRNA binding or the completion of the aminoacylation reaction should lead to significant conformational rearrangement in the active site. A possible hypothesis is that concomitant binding of the tRNA and closing of the insertion domain could lead to new interactions between the insertion domain and both the histidine-1 peptide and the highly conserved region around residue 60. Resultant conformational adjustments of these regions could open up slightly the active site to permit binding of A-76 and subsequent release of the histidine moiety of the charged tRNAhis after the aminoacylation step. However, it should be borne in mind that the conformational changes may in fact be larger scale and also involve the C-terminal anticodon binding domain, consistent with the small flexibility seen in this domain (Figure 6) and with a recent report that mutations in this domain and its interface with the catalytic domain can

FIGURE 7: (a, top) GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991) view of the electrostatic potential surface around HisRSTT and (b, bottom) view with the superposed docked tRNA molecule. Negative potential (-12 kT) is in red and positive (12 kT) in blue.

well ordered in the HisRSTT structure, could also interact with C73. Finally, there are three largely conserved basic residues, Lys-63, Arg-71, and Arg-115, that are strategically positioned to possibly make contacts with the extra 5phosphate of G-1. The fact that Lys-63 is absolutely conserved in all known HisRS sequences makes it a particularly plausible candidate for this important interaction. Concerning the mode of binding of the C-terminal domain to the anticodon stem-loop of tRNAHis, this is an outstanding question that can only be satisfactorily addressed by a crystal structure of the cognate complex. Interestingly, there are extremely few conserved residues in the C-terminal domain which could give a hint as to the critical regions. This applies not only to known HisRS sequences (Figure 1) which generally will recognize a GUG anticodon but also to other class IIa synthetases which possess this domain (Cusack, 1993). This is in contrast to the three class IIb synthetases whose homologous N-terminal domains all recognize a central U-35 in the anticodon by means of absolutely conserved glutamine and phenylalanine residues (Cavarelli et al., 1993; Cusack et al., 1996b). However, as has been remarked above, the first part of the C-terminal domain is

3094 Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 11, 1997 compensate for unfavorable mutations in the tRNAHis discriminator base (Yan et al., 1996). The conformational dynamics during the overall aminoacylation reaction is clearly a subtle and important element in the functioning and specificity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases as has been demonstrated recently in the case of seryl-tRNA synthetase (Cusack et al., 1996a). In the case of histidyl-tRNA synthetase it is evident that further understanding will depend on the structure determination of the complex between HisRS, histidine, and tRNAHis (Yaremchuk et al., 1995).
