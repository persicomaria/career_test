The aim of the present study is to identify the activity-linked group, to understand the role of the active-site hydrogen-bond network and to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition by anionic inhibitors.

Experimental
Data collection and processing
Three-dimensional diffraction data, 92.8% complete to 2 A resolution, collected earlier by the precession method for 40 layers (Kannan et al., 1975), were used in the refinement of HCAI-Au(CN);. Crystals of HCAI-iodide were obtained by soaking the native HCAI crystals in a solution of 2.5 M (NH4)2SO4 and 0.05 M Tris-SO4 (pH 8.5) containing 0.02 M NH4I, for 24 h. The unit-cell parameters of the complex were found to be a = 81.8, b = 75.2, c = 37.1 A and the space group was P2~2~21. The crystals were isomorphous with native HCAI and HCAI-Au(CN)2- crystals. Three-dimensional oscillation data from crystals of H C A I - I - , mounted along a* axis, were collected on CEA reflex films on an Arndt-Woncott oscillation camera using Ni-filtered Cu Ka radiation from a GX-20 rotating-anode X-ray generator. 60 film packs covering 90 ° of reciprocal space were measured and processed on a Scandig-3 microdensitometer controlled by a PDP 11/34 computer, using an offiine version of the MOSCO program package, modified from the original NOVA computer version kindly supplied by Dr A. J. Wonacott and implemented on the PDP11/34 system (Pal, Chakravarty & Kannan, 1984; Chakravarty & Kannan, 1990). The data were scaled using the 3D scaling program kindly provided by Dr D. Stuart and modified by us for a NORSK DATA 570 computer resulting in 10 061 unique reflections. The relevant statistics for this data set are given in Table 1.

Refinement
The refined structure of HCAI (Kannan, Ramanadham & Jones, 1984) was used as the starting model in the refinement of both the structures. The position of I - w a s located in difference Fourier maps, whereas the initial parameters for gold(I) were those reported by Kannan et al. (1975). The two structures were refined in stages (Table 2) by the stereochemically restrained least-squares method using the PROLSQ suite of programs (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980) and manual model building on VG-3400 and IRIS-4D/20 graphics workstations using FRODO/TOM (Jones, 1982; Cambillau & Horjales, 1987) at the end of each stage of PROLSQ refinement. The improvement of the model was achieved by manually correcting the misplaced atoms and locating new solvent molecules using (2Fo- F~),

(Fo- Fc) and 'omit'-type maps (Vijayan, 1980; Bhat
& Cohen, 1984). The Fourier maps were computed using the PROTEIN program package (Steigmann, 1974) modified for the NORSK DATA 570 computer. The scale factor and overall B value for each complex obtained from a Wilson plot were refined in the initial stages. In subsequent cycles of refinement, the scale factor and occupancy of newly added solvents and inhibitor anions, located from AF Fourier maps, were refined in addition to positional parameters and individual B values for all the atoms. Only solvent molecules with refined occupancy of more than 30% or B values of less than 58 A 2 were retained in the model. The weights used during the course of the refinement for various restraints and for the diffrac-

However, after every cycle of model building the weight of the diffraction term was reduced in the subsequent two cycles of PROLSQ to improve the stereochemistry of the model. The stereochemistries of the final models were also evaluated by the PROCHEK suite of programs (Laskowski, MacArthur, Moss & Thornton, 1993). Before cycles 7 and 23 of the refinement of H C A I - I - , the individual B values of protein and solvent atoms were reset to their average values, as reported by Ramanadham, Sieker & Jensen (1990), in view of the limited quality of the data (Table 1). The initial difference Fourier maps of H C A I Au(CN)z- clearly revealed the gold(I) position but only one of the C N - groups pointing away from the zinc(II) ion. However, the other C N - ligand could be located from subsequent difference Fourier maps during the course of the refinement. Initially only covalent distances (1-2 distances) were restrained. Angle restraints (1-3 distances) for Au(CN)z- were used in the refinement after the fifth model building using computer graphics. Coordinate information from the crystal structure of K[Au(CN)2] (Rosenzweig & Cromer, 1959) was incorporated in the PROLSQ and FRODO/TOM restraint dictionaries.

The stereochemistry of the refined models is good as shown in Table 3 and the values of different stereochemical parameters are within the generally observed ranges as indicated in Table 4. The expected coordinate error estimated from Luzzati plots (Luzzati, 1952) is between 0.20 and 0.25 A~ in H C A I - I - and is 0.20 A~ in HCAI-Au(CN)2-. Except for a few amino-terminal residues (see Table 2) and the side chains of Lysl0, Arg173 and Glu221 (also that of Asp9 in H C A I - I - ) , the quality of the electron-density maps was good in both the structures as can be seen from the representative regions given in Fig. 1. Based on the high-resolution structure of HCAIHCO3- (Dmin = 1.6 A) (Vinay Kumar & Kannan, unpublished results), residues 74 and 75 were corrected from the PDB entry (entry 2CAB, version of October 1984) (Kannan et al., 1984) during the course of the refinement from Gin and Asp to Asp and Asn, respectively. These substitutions are also consistent with the chemical sequence of HCAI and the observed electron density in the Fourier maps of the two structures.

The inhibitor I- is found to replace the zinc(II)coordinated H 2 0 / O H - ligand. The corresponding

difference electron density is shown in Fig. 2(a). The refined occupancy and the B value of this I- are 2 77 oYo and 14/~, respectively, and the unrestrained Z n - - I - distance is 2.7 A,. Additional electron density (Fig. 2b) was observed in the vicinity of this I - , which has been interpreted as due to two solvent molecules. In the initial phase of refinement, the SG atom of Cys212 shifted by about 2 A into a heavy unaccounted peak in electron density, disturbing the stereochemistry around residue Cys212. This electron density was subsequently interpreted as corresponding to another I- with a sulfur-iodide distance of 2.2 ~. Its occupancy and B value refined to 48% and 11.4 A 2, respectively. Only a few stable sulfur-iodide bonds have so far been reported (Klapotze & Pass-

During the later stages of refinement, three more solvent molecules associated with heavy electron density and negative B values were also treated as I - ions. The occupancies and the B values of these sites refined to 38, 51 and 45%, and 25, 43 and 22 A 2, respectively. These sites are in the vicinity of Glul4, Asn75 and L y s l l 3 , and no biological function can be assigned to them.

Au(CN)2-, with a B value and an occupancy of 18.5 A 2 and 51%, respectively, for the Au(I) ion, binds in the active site close to the zinc(II) ion with the nearest N atom at a distance of 3 . 4 A from zinc(II) and a Z n - A u distance of 6.1 A. The other N atom of Au(CN)2- points into the opening of the active-site cavity and away from the zinc ion, and is at a distance of 9.2 A from the zinc ion (Fig. 3). However, an abnormally low B value and a high occupancy for the distal C N - and a heavy elongated residual electron density at this site indicated the presence of higher scattering matter. Another gold(I) ion was, therefore, included at this site partially overlapping with the C atom of the A u ( C N ) [ (d-0.5 A). It refined to a B value and an occupancy of 12.6A 2 and 15%, respectively. This site is at a distance of 1.5 A from the major gold(I) site. Unlike I - , Au(CN)2- does not replace the zinc(II)coordinated H 2 0 / O H - ligand. An N atom of the Au(CN)2- is within hydrogen-bonding distance (2.9 A) of this H z O / O H - group. The most prominent effect of A u ( C N ) / binding is an increase in the Z n " - - O H - bond length by 0.4 A (Table 5). The stereochemistry of the active-site Au(CN)2- in the

complex is in good agreement with that found in the structure of K[Au(CN)2] (Rosenzweig & Cromer, 1959). However, the bond angle (N~=C--Au) involving the N atom pointing towards the zinc ion and hydrogen bonded with the HzO/OH- group, is distorted by 13° from the value of 172.8 ~ in K[Au(CN)2]. Two additional gold(I) sites, in the vicinity of Asn178 and Asn26, respectively, have also been identified. The site near Asn178 had also been reported by Kannan et al. (1975) from heavy-atom refinement during the course of multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) structure determination of HCAI.
Comparison with the native structure

In spite of the variations in protein hydration, the prominent active-site hydrogen-bonding network, observed in native HCAI (Kannan et al., 1984), is also maintained in the complex. This network, interconnecting active-site residues Thr199, Glu 106, Tyr7, His64, His67 and His200, and a number of solvent molecules, has been conjectured to act as a protonrelay system (Kannan et al., 1984).
Discussion

The r.m.s, displacement between the native HCAI structure (Kannan, 1990; Ramanadham & Kannan, unpublished results) and the structures of H C A I - I and HCAI-Au(CN)z-, and between the two inhibitor complexes, for all the equivalent protein atoms, are 0.42, 0.44 and 0.48 A, respectively. Except for marginal changes in the side-chain orientations of Leu198 and His200 in H C A I - I - , and in that of His200 in HCAI-Au(CN)S, significant changes are not observed in the conformation of other active-site residues on inhibitor binding. However, variations are observed in the solvent structure of the three models (Table 6). The results presented in Table 6 conform to earlier reports that protein main-chain O atoms participate in more hydrogen bonds with the solvent molecules than main-chain N atoms do (Baker & Hubbard, 1984; Madhusudan, Kodandapani & Vijayan, 1993).

The structures of CA enzymes (Kannan et al., 1984; Vinay Kumar, Kannan & Chidambaram, 1989; Hakansson et al., 1992; Eriksson & Liljas, 1993) have revealed that the essential zinc(II), located at the apex of a funnel-shaped cavity, is approximately tetrahedrally liganded by three active-site residues His94, His96 and His119, and one water molecule. It is generally accepted that the zinc(II)-bound H20 initiates the reaction and carries out the nucleophilic attack, in the O H - form (Davis, 1959), on the electron-deficient carbon centre of the substrate CO2 molecule. In the structure of the HCAI-iodide complex, the inhibitor I- replaces the fourth coordinated H 2 0 / O H - ligand, without disturbing the distorted tetrahedral geometry around the zinc ion. The observed Z n - I - distance of 2.7 A in the complex structure agrees well with the distance of 2.65 A reported from EXAFS studies on the BCA-iodide complex (Brown, Navon & Shulman, 1977). However, a Z n - I - disance of 3.7 A was reported from earlier investigations of H C A I I - I - based on heavyatom refinement with MIR phases (Waara et al.,

736

CARBONIC A N H Y D R A S E I reveal an H(OH-)-N[Au(CN)2-] distance of about 2/~ with an H - - N - - C angle of about 114 °. Such interactions referred to as rr-hydrogen bonds (Atwood, Hamada, Robinson, Orr & Vincent, 1991) have also been reported recently in other 7r-electronrich systems (Sarma, Dhurjati, Bhanuprakash & Ravikumar, 1993; Viswamitra, Radhakrishnan, Bandekar & Desiraju, 1993). The formation of a hydrogen bond with the inhibitor N atom would hinder the zinc-bound O H - in acting as donor to form a hydrogen bond to OG1 of the invariant Thrl99 (Kannan et al., 1984), considered important for the function of the enzyme (Kannan et al., 1977; Merz, 1990). Instead, the H atom in the complex would be pointing towards the proposed substrate (CO2) binding site which is in the vicinity of the zinc(II) ion (Kannan et al., 1977), and in a pocket defined by His94, Hisll9, Vall21, Val143, Leu198, Thr199, Val207, Trp209 and the zinc(II)-bound O H - group in HCAII (Liang & Lipscomb, 1990; Merz, 1991). This reorientation of the H atom would interfere with the substrate binding and thus inhibit the enzyme. In the known crystal structures of CA enzymes, the zinc-bound H 2 0 / O H - group is within hydrogenbonding distance of the OG1 atom of Thr199 which in turn is hydrogen-bonded to an invariant Glul06. This hydrogen-bonding network has been considered important for catalysis by CA enzymes (Kannan et al., 1977). Recently, using molecular-dynamics calculations, Merz (1990) proposed that the O H -Thr199-Glu106 network 'locks-in' the H atom of the O H - in a position away from the possible substrate (CO2) binding site, thus avoiding steric hindrance to substrate binding. This network also facilitates the nucleophilic attack of the oriented lone pair on the substrate molecule (Kannan, 1980b; Merz, 1990). This is in conformity with our proposal for A u ( C N ) / inhibition. From the crystallographic investigations of a number of anionic inhibitor complexes of HCAII, it has also been proposed that Thr199, as a hydrogen-bond acceptor, acts as a 'door keeper' and only protonated groups can occupy the H 2 0 / O H - site, and unprotonated ligands bind at a different site on the zinc ion (Eriksson, Kylsten, Jones & Liljas, 1988; Xue et al., 1993). This forms the basis of recent proposals on substrate H C 0 3 binding and the mechanism of action of the enzyme. I- cannot, however, donate a proton, though it is found to replace the activity-linked H 2 0 / O H - group in our studies and also in that of Eriksson et al. (1986). The same is also true of the SO4, the Brand the N3 complexes of HCAII (Hakansson et al., 1992; Jonsson, Hakansson & Liljas, 1993; Nair & Christianson, 1993). Interestingly, the binding site of Br- is similar to that in our earlier proposal based on modelling studies (Vinay Kumar, 1992).

1972). In contrast to results of this and related investigations of HCAII, which reported binding of I3 in the active site (Waara et al., 1972 ; Eriksson et al., 1986), we observe only one I- in the active site of HCAI. The density corresponding to the two solvents in the vicinity of the active site I- cannot, however, be interpreted to be oxidized iodide anions, as the observed I --OH2--OH2 angle in H C A I - I is 94 ° whereas I3 is a linear molecule. The refined B values of these solvent O atoms are 4.9 and 6.5 ,~2 with unit occupancy as compared to 14,~2 and an occupancy of 77% for the I - . Also, the distances between these atoms in this cluster are 2.6 and 2.3 A as compared to 2.83 and 3.03/~ observed in I3 (Cotton & Wilkinson, 1972). Except for the substitution of zinc(II)-bound H 2 0 / O H - with the inhibitor I- and marginal positional shifts in Leu198 and His200 in the complex, the active-site structure is unperturbed when compared with that of the native HCAI. This result confirms earlier suggestions that the H 2 0 / O H ligand in the native enzyme is the activity-linked group (Davis, 1959; Silverman & Lindskog, 1988). Unlike many other anionic inhibitors, Au(CN)2 binds in a different part of the active-site cavity and is not bound directly to the zinc ion. The observed bending of the N~----C--Au angle, by 13° from the ideal value, facilitates the orientation of a lone pair on the N atom towards the positively charged zinc ion (Zn--N----C = 145°). The Z n - - N distance of 3.4 A may imply a weak interaction of the anion with the zinc, which may also explain the observed shift of 0.4 A of the H 2 0 / O H - group away from zinc, resulting from the partial neutralization of the positive charge on the zinc ion. However, from spectroscopic investigations of the cobalt(II)-substituted BCA--Au(CN)2 complex it was postulated that the inhibitor anion binds to the zinc ion (Bertini et al., 1980). Similar results have also been reported for other anionic inhibitor complexes like those of C N and C N O - with HCAII (Lindahl et al., 1993). It is indeed interesting that the binding site of Au(CN)£ in HCAII (Eriksson, Jones & Liljas, 1986) is almost the same as that found in HCAI. The presence of the activity-linked zinc-coordinated solvent is also reported in the inhibitor complex of HCAII. In contrast to the results of the present studies, the C N - groups of Au(CN)£ could not be located in H C A I I I - A u ( C N ) / a n d was, therefore, thought to be substituted by NH3 from the crystallization media. Hence, the mechanism of inhibition of HCAII by Au(CN)£ could not be clearly elucidated for the HCAII enzyme (Eriksson et al., 1986). In HCAI-Au(CN)2--the electron-rich N atom closest to zinc(II) ( Z n - - N = 3.4/~) is hydrogen bonded to the activity-linked group, with an O(H)---N distance of 2.9 A. Model-building studies

Further, I- is located in the pocket defined by the 198-200 loop of the protein (Fig. 4). Although the Z n - - I distance of 2.7 A in the coml~lex is longer than the Z n - - O ( O H ) distance of 1.9 A in the native enzyme, the distorted tetrahedral coordination of the zinc(lI) is preserved in the complex. The longer Z n - - I - distance results from the larger radius of I - . The long Au(CN)2- cannot bind in the same site as I- due to steric hindrance from protein atoms of the 198-200 loop.

Concluding remarks
Our results confirm that the zinc(lI)-bound H20/OH is the activity-linked group for CA enzymes. Replacement of this group, as observed in HCAI-I, results in the inhibition of CA enzymes. The conformational reorientation of the OH - group, as in the case of HCAI-Au(CN)2-, could also abolish the catalytic activity. Our results show that OGI of Thr199 is not a compulsive hydrogen-bond acceptor and unprotonated ligands can also replace the O H group, van der Waals interactions with OG1 of Thr199 and steric factors involving the Leu198 to His200 loop, in addition to hydrogen-bond interactions, are also important in accounting for the differences in the binding sites of various inhibitors of CA enzymes.
