R. M. KISIand S. IWANAG^.Structure-function relationships of phospholipases I: prediction of presynaptic neurotoxicity. Toxicon 24, 527-541, 1986. -- The hydropathic indexes of 24 phospholipases have been calculated from their amino acid sequences.The presynapticneurotoxic potential of venom phospholipases can be predicted by the use of hydropathy profiles. The presynaptically acting phospholipases have a distinct hydrophobic region around the residues 80-110 which is probably involved in the interaction with the presynaptic membranes. This region is present as a separate helixin the tertiary structure of phospholipases. Such a hydrophobic region is absent in non-neurotoxic phospholipases.

INTRODUCTION PHOSPHOLIPASES A2 (EC 3.1.1.4) (PLA,) occur in venoms o f snakes, scorpions, bees and mammalian tissues. The venom PLAz, along with their contribution in digesting the prey (Tu, 1977), induce pathological symptoms (KARLSSON, 1979; ROSENBERG, 1979; HOWARD and GUNDERSEN, 1980; FRANKEL-CONRAT, 1982-- 1983). All presynaptically acting neurotoxins are either basic PLA2s p e r se or contain basic P L A , as an indispensible part of their structures. PLA2s induce myotoxic (GOPALAKRISHNAKONE et al., 1984), cardiotoxic (FLETCHER et al., 1981), hemolytic (CONDREA et al., 1980, 1981b), anticoagulant (CONDREA et al., 1981c, 1982), convulsant (FLETCHER el al., 1980) and hypotensive (HUANG, 1984) effects. Any acidic PLA2 from Trimeresurus flavoviridis venom kills mice by causing internal hemorrhage and bleeding (Vishwanath, Kini and Gowda, unpublished observations), while a basic PLA2 from Vipera russelli venom induces liver necrosis (VISHWANATHet al., 1985). Venom PLA,s thus seem to be involved in most o f the pharmacological effects induced in snake venom poisoning. The s t r u c t u r e - f u n c t i o n relationship in PLA2s is interesting, because PLA2s possess various biological properties but share a c o m m o n qualitative catalytic property. The residues in the catalytic site, Ca a÷ binding site and the interface recognition site have been identified (For details refer to the review by VERHEIJ et al., 1981). Attempts are being made to identify the relationships among lethal, anticoagulant, hemolytic and catalytic activity o f PLA2s. Alkylation o f His-48 led to a dramatic and equal loss of enzymatic activity and lethal toxicity (YANG and KING, 1980a, b; YANG et al., 1981a; CONDREA et al., 1981a; ABE et al., 1977; HALPERT et al., 1976). A successful dissociation o f the enzymatic and pharmacological properties has also been achieved (YANG et al., 1981 a, b, 1982; CONDREA et aL, 1981b, 1983; YANG, 1984a; BARRINGTON et al., 1984). Modification o f lysines, either by guanidination or by carbamylation, had little effect on 527

the enzyme activity, while the lethality of N a j a nigricollis PLA2 was decreased to about 13% of the native enzyme (CONDREAet al., 1981b; ROSENBERG et al., 1983a; YANG, 1984b). Modification of carboxylate groups causes loss of catalytic activity, but considerable pharmacological potency is preserved (YANGet al., 1983; BA.RRINGTON et al., 1984; ROSENBERG et al., 1983 a, b). However, the identification of the specific amino acid residues or the region of the molecule involved in the pharmacological activities is far from certain. We were interested in the presynaptic neurotoxicity of PLA~s, as this property is exhibited by a large number of PLA2s and the presynaptic neurotoxins are highly potent toxins of snake venoms. A complicating factor in elucidating the s t r u c t u r e - f u n c t i o n relationships for this group of esterolytic/toxic molecules is their diversity in subunit molecular structures (VILJOENet al., 1982). In some instances the activity is associated with single chain molecules (HA.LPERTand EAKER, 1975; JOUBERT, 1977; VILJOEN et al., 1982), while others exist in an active form in binary, ternary or quarternary complexes (SIMON et al., 1980; FOHLMAN et al., 1976; BREITHAUPT et al., 1974; S u e t al., 1983; TSAI et al., 1983). Although there is considerable evidence in favour of the essential role of PLA2 activity in toxicity (STRONGet al., 1976; HALPERT et al., 1976; HOWARD and TRUOG, 1977; BON and SALIOU, 1983), no one has yet been able to pinpoint the structural features and physicochemical properties that render these PLA2 enzymes such potent toxins (ROSENBERG, 1979; YANG, 1984b). In this paper we report one approach for the prediction of neurotoxic potential and the identification of the region of the molecule involved in the neurotoxicity of snake venom PLA2 enzymes using hydropathic index calculations. METHODS The hydropathic indexes for the PLA2s were calculated from the known amino acid sequencesaccording to the method of KVTEand DOOUTTLE0982). The span of consecutiveresidues to yield the hydropathy profile were 7 and 9. This selectionwas made to accommodateany probable discrepancyin the profile due to only one span length. In this paper all the hydropathy valuesare presentedas the sum of the residuesinvolvedrather than the averages. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The primary requisite for any protein to be neurotoxic is that it should interact with a biomembrane. The PLA2s which exhibit presynaptic neurotoxicity should interact with a region of the neuromuscular junction. This led to the thought that PLAas should possess a c o m m o n hydrophobic region in the molecule to satisfy the above requisites. To identify such a region, we calculated the hydropathic indexes for several PLA~s which possess presynaptic neurotoxicity, either alone or in combination, and also those which do not possess such neurotoxicity. We have chosen 24 PLA2s as representatives o f enzymes having various degrees of presynaptic neurotoxicity (Table I). The hydropathy profiles were obtained by plotting the hydropathic indexes against the sequence residue numbers, and not the homology numbers. Figures l and 2 represent the hydropathy profiles o f the non-neurotoxic PLAas from mammalian and snake venom sources. In Figs. 3 and 4, the hydropathy profiles of PLA2s having presynaptic neurotoxicity are shown. When these profiles are compared, there is a distinct difference in residue numbers 8 0 - I I0 (depending on the deletions and the insertions). In the case of relatively non-toxic PLA2s, there is a distinct hydrophilic depression in the mid part o f this region (for example, in Fig. l around residue 100 and in

Prediction of Phospholipase Presynaptic Toxicity

529

Fig. 2 around the residue 95), while such a depression is absent in case of neurotoxic PLA2s (Figs. 3 and 4). In C. atrox PLA2 (Fig. 2C), the hydrophilic depression is not clearly defined because the hydrophobicity of the region prior to the depression is not well pronounced compared with other non-neurotoxic PLA,s. This gives a false impression of a 'neurotoxic' hydrophobic region in the non-neurotoxic PLA2. We identify this region of about 1 5 - 2 0 residues as a possible site essential for the presynaptic neurotoxicity of PLA2s. It is the relative hydrophobicity of the region which determines the interaction with the presynaptic site, but the absolute value may contribute to the affinity between PLA, and the presynaptic site. We would like to discuss the anomalies observed in the hydropathy profiles and the pharmacological properties of those enzymes. The Australian tiger snake, Notechis scutatus scutatus, has both postsynaptic and presynaptic neurotoxins. Three proteins homologous to PLA2 have been isolated from this venom (Table 1). Notexin and notechis II-5 both have PLA2 activity and presynaptic activity, while notechis II-1 shows neither toxic nor catalytic properties (KARLSSON, 1979). From the hydropathy profiles all three proteins should possess neurotoxicity (Fig. 5), however, this is only true for notexin and notechis II-5. Notechis II-1, even though inactive as a toxin or enzyme, binds C a " and has the reactive His-48 (KARLSSON, 1979). Probably, this non-neurotoxic analog can also interact with the presynaptic site, similar to notexin and notechis II-5. Notexin loses its toxicity and catalytic activity after alkylation of His-48, indicating the importance of enzymatic activity for neurotoxicity (HALPERT et ai., 1976). In addition, it is also known that the binding step is not abolished when the enzyme is inactivated by p-bromophenacyl bromide or use of Sr "÷ instead of Ca 2+. Thus, the preferred hypothesis is that these toxins are bound at a specific presynaptic site and then secondarily, through phospholipase action, attack the membranes of the synapse, disrupting neurotransmitter transport, as this explains the observed biphasic effects (REHM and BETZ, 1983; CHANG et al., 1977; STRONG et al., 1976; OBERG and KELLY, 1976). Thus, notechis II-1 may bind to the presynaptic site, but fails to exhibit neurotoxic activity because of its enzymatic inactivity. Recent studies by modification of various amino acid residues indicate that catalytic and pharmacological activities of PLA, can be dissociated (YANG et al., 1981a, b; BARRINGTONet al., 1984; CONDREA et al., 1981b, 1983; ROSENBERGet al., 1983a, b; YANG, 1984a, b). However, no such detailed studies have been made in the case of presynaptically active PLA, enzymes. Further studies on PLA, analogs and specific amino acid modifications in presynaptically active PLA2s may throw more light on such anomalies. Caudoxin, a single chain neurotoxic PLA2 from Bitis caudalis venom (LEE et al., 1979, 1982; VILJOEN et al., 1982), has a different hydropathy profile than the other neurotoxic PLA2s (Fig. 6A). It possesses a sharp hydrophohic region which exactly overlaps the hydrophilic depression of the non-neurotoxic PLA,s (Figs. 1 and 2). This supports the suggestion that the hydrophilic depression is the cause for the non-neurotoxic nature of the PLA,s. On the other hand, B. gabonica PLA2, which also possesses a similar hydrophobic region (Fig. 6B), is non-neurotoxic. This may be due to a change in conformation, as this protein does not have the 7th disulfide bridge, which is very near to the essential neurotoxic site. Alternatively, the difference may be due to the presence of an extremely hydrophilic region preceding the 'neurotoxic' region. The neurotoxicity of PLA2s of the single chain type can be predicted by hydropathy profiles. It would be interesting to know whether this theory can also explain the neurotoxicity of PLA2s which are toxic in combination with other proteins: the interacting proteins may be homologous to PLA2, as in taipoxin, or not related to PLA2 proteins, as

in/3-bungarotoxin and crotoxin. Thus, the hydropathy profiles of the PLA2 counterparts of these toxins were also studied. Taipoxin, from Oxyuranus scuteilatus scuteilatus venom, is the most potent neurotoxic protein isolated from snake venoms (KARLSSON, 1979). It is a non-covalently linked ternary complex of three non-identical subunits, i.e. a, fl, and y (FOHLMANeta/., 1976). The a-subunit is toxic, but two orders of magnitude less than the complex. The a- and/3subunits are homologous to PLA2s, while the y-subunit is homologous to porcine proPLA2, with an extra N-terminal octapeptide (KARLSSON, 1979). In this paper we have neither included this octapeptide in Table 1 nor used it in calculating the hydropathy profile. The neurotoxicity of the a-subunit and the non-neurotoxic nature of the y-subunit can be explained by the hydropathy profile (Fig. 7). The fl-subunit also possesses the 'neurotoxic' region and the same argument as in the case of notechis II-I can be used, since the /3-subunit shows negligible catalytic activity (KARLSSON, 1979). When these subunits interact, the complex has two subunits and has affinity for the presynaptic site. This may explain the escalation in the toxicity through specific adsorption. /I-Bungarotoxin, isolated from Bungarus multicinctus, is one of the most studied presynaptic neurotoxins (HOWARD and GUNDERSEN, 1980). In contrast to talpoxin, it is a covalent complex of two non-identical subunits. A disulfide linkage binds the A and B chains (KONDO et ai., 1982a, b). The A chain of/3-bungarotoxins shows homology with PLA2s (Table 1). The hydropathy profiles (Fig. 8) indicate that the A chains do not contain a hydrophobic site. The B chain is homologous to trypsin inhibitors and dendrotoxins - - presynaptically acting facilitatory neurotoxins (HARVEYeta/., 1984a, b).

The hydropathy profiles of B chains of /],- and /32-bungarotoxins have relatively hydrophobic regions around residues 1 5 - 3 5 (data not shown) which are probably involved in the interaction with the presynaptic membranes. In support of our suggestion, it should be noted that facilitatory toxins, like dendrotoxin, release neurotransmitters by binding to the presynaptic site, while the binding of PLA2s to the presynaptic membranes also causes the release of acetylcholine in the first phase of the biphasic effect (REHM and BETZ, 1983; CHANG et al., 1977; STRONG et al., 1976; OBERG and KELLY, 1976). The presence of overlapping hydrophobic regions in dendrotoxin and the B chain of ~bungarotoxin further supports our contention. Moreover, four out of five residues

predicted to be involved in facilitatory activity (HARVEY et aL, 1984b) are located in this hydrophobic region. KONDO et ai., (1978) have also postulated that the B chain plays a significant role in the neurotoxicity of the toxin by interacting with the presynaptic site of the neuromuscular junction. Crotoxin, from Crotalus durissus terrificus venom, was one of the first crystallized snake venom toxins (SLOTTA and FRANKEL-CONRAT, 1938). This toxin is composed of two non-covalently linked non-identical subunits: a strongly basic component (crotoxin B) which carries the PLA2 activity and possesses a low toxicity and an acidic component (crotapotin) which is both non-enzymatic and non-toxic (HENDON and FRANKELCONRAT, 1971). These subunits spontaneously combine to reconstitute a one-to-one complex having the properties of the native toxin (RUBSAMEN et al., 1972; HORST et al., 1972). Crotoxin differs from taipoxin and/3-bungarotoxin in that it also interferes at the postsynaptic site of neurotransmission (BON, 1982). Crotoxin B is homologous in structure to PLA2s (Table 1) of Group II (HEINRIKSON et al., 1977). The hydropathy profile (Fig. 9) is different from all other PLA2s. The hydrophobic region is broad and not well pronounced and the 'neurotoxic' site in this region is comparatively a little more hydrophobic in nature. This may explain the nonsaturable (therefore non-specific) binding of crotoxin B to an extremely large number of binding sites, either on postsynaptic membranes (BON et aL, 1979) or on erythrocyte plasma membranes (JENGel al., 1978). On the other hand, crotapotin never binds to membranes, either isolated or in association with crotoxin B (BON, 1982). Recent structural studies on crotapotin (KAISER et al., 1985) indicate the homology of this subunit with PLA~, but the protein has three polypeptide units and one of them (B chain) is homologous with the 'neurotoxic' site. The inability of crotapotin to bind to membranes may be due to a change in conformation, a consequence of the cleavage in the protein. Interaction between crotoxin and crotapotin prevents the non-specific binding of crotoxin B and thus enhances pharmacological efficiency. The distinct hydropathy profile of crotoxin B indicates the totally different nature of the protein. This is experimentally supported by the fact that the acidic component fails to potentiate the toxicity of any other PLA2 (HABERMANN and BREITHAUPT, 1978). Furthermore, on the basis of the above discussion, we can conclude that talpoxin,/3-bungarotoxin and crotoxin have distinctly different types of association and synergism. Probably, they interact at different sites of the presynaptic side of the neuromuscular junction. Under these circumstances one can expect a mutual potentiation between these toxins. CHANG and SU (1980) have observed such a mutual potentiation at the nerve terminals. From the above examples we predict that the region 8 0 - 110 in PLA2s is involved in their neurotoxicity. The neurotoxic potency, however, depends on the absolute hydrophobicity, the charge density, conformational restraints and other parameters which influence the affinity between PLA2s and the presynaptic site. Our results need not imply that the neurotoxic residues are only in this region of the molecule, merely that this region may play a significant role in the neurotoxicity of PLA2s, probably in their binding to the presynaptic membranes. STRYDOM (1979), while describing the evolution of toxins, has discussed the homology between postsynaptic neurotoxins and PLAas. The neurotoxins are homologous with the C-terminal region of PLA2s (Table 2). It is interesting to note that the neurotoxic region identified in neurotoxins (TSETLIN el aL, 1982) overlaps with the neurotoxic region of PLA2 enzymes predicted by the hydropathy profiles, strongly supporting our prediction. The hydropathy profile of post synaptically acting neurotoxins (Fig. 10) also has a similar

hydrophobic region in the molecule which is involved in the interaction with the postynaptic membranes (TSETLIN et al., 1982). The difference in the site of action of these groups of toxins may be due to the chemical nature of the residues, the charge density and other conformational parameters. The last question remaining to be answered is whether the predicted neurotoxic region is conformationally available for interaction with membranes? DUFTON et al., (1983) have calculated similar secondary structural parameters of PLA2s. The tertiary structure of

three PLA2 enzymes (one representative from each group; HEINRIKSON et al., 1977) has been studied by X-ray analyses: bovine and porcine pancreatic PLA2 (DIJKSTRA et al., 1978, 1983) and C r o t a l u s a t r o x PLA2 (KEITH et al., 1981). The results indicate that the main chain conformations are very similar (RENETSEDERet al., 1985). In the absence of 3dimensional structures of other PLA2s and in the light of homologous primary and secondary structures, we assume that other PLA2 enzymes also have similar, but not identical, main chain folding (Fig. 11). The 'neurotoxic' region is located separately on helix E in the tertiary structure of PLA2 proteins. This region is readily available for interaction with presynaptic membranes and is in the vicinity of the catalytic site. Earlier, DUFTON and HIDER (1983) and DUFTON et al. (1983) attempted to relate the structure of PLA~ enzymes to presynaptic toxicity. They compared the sequences of neurotoxic and non-neurotoxic PLA2s (DUFTON and HIDER, 1983). L a t i c a u d a s e m i f a s c i a t a phospholipases (PLA~ I, III and IV) are considered as non-neurotoxic PLA2s in their study, while they are neurotoxic according to HARVEY and TAMIYA (1980). Thus, some of the conclusions drawn from the differences in the sequences between neurotoxic and non-neurotoxic PLA2s may be invalid. On the other hand, they also attempted to relate the hydrophilicity of the interface recognition site to the presynaptic neurotoxicity (DUFTON et al., 1983). The predicted interface hydrophilicity ranges from + 13.6 (/3bungarotoxin A2) to - 1 1 . 1 (taipoxin a), with no relation to presynaptic activity of PLA2s. Thus, both methods, direct comparison of the sequences and estimation of the hydrophilicity of the predicted interface recognition site, fail to give any conclusive information regarding presynaptic neurotoxicity of PLA2s. With hydrophathic profiles, however, the observed neurotoxic and non-neurotoxic nature of PLA2s (not only the 24 PLA2s discussed here, but also of several others) can be explained by the presence of a characteristic hydrophobic region. In conclusion, from the hydropathy profiles, which can be readily calculated from the amino acid sequence, the neurotoxic nature of the PLA2 enzymes can be predicted. From such profiles it appears that residues 8 0 - 1 1 0 (about 1 5 - 2 0 residues) appear to be involved in the interaction of these proteins with presynaptic membranes. This region is similar in hydrophobic nature to that of the neurotoxic site of postsynaptically acting neurotoxins. This 'neurotoxic' region is located on a separate helix on the surface in 3dimensional folding of the PLA2 proteins. However, there are probably other factors governing neurotoxicity which are yet to be uncovered which will aid in our understanding of the neurotoxic nature of venom phospholipases.
