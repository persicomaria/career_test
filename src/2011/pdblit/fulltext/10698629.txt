Abstract Red abalone (Haliotis rufescens ) were exposed to 3.6 mM (0.5 ppm) 14C-labelled p -nitrophenol (PNP) for 24 h, then were allowed to depurate in clean seawater for another 24 h. Absorption, conditional uptake clearance and elimination rate constants were 0.129/0.04 h(1, 3.29/1.1 ml g (1 h (1 and 0.059/0.02 h(1, respectively. The sigmoidal shape of the PNP uptake curve suggests a biphasic process. A whole-organism total concentration factor (TCF) of 2.379/0.07 was determined from equilibrium tissue and water concentrations, with the highest concentration of PNP plus metabolites found in gill tissue (11.89/0.2 nmol g (1, wet weight). Digestive gland, foot muscle and remaining body tissues accumulated 8.89/0.9, 7.79/0.6 and 7.59/0.6 nmol g (1 radiolabelled residues, respectively. Abalone depurated 91.6% of absorbed PNP within 24 h, of which 87.59/3.1% was unmetabolized parent compound, 13.19/3.1% was p nitrophenylsulfate, 0.329/0.09% was p -nitroanisole, and 0.149/0.07% was p -acetamidophenol. # 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction Para -nitrophenol (PNP) is a highly water-soluble weak acid that enters the environment via a number of routes including wastewater discharges from dye manufacturers, leather tanners and pesticide manufacturers, photooxidation of nitrobenzene in air, motor vehicle emissions, and degradation of ethyl and methyl parathion.

the United States, PNP concentrations of up to 190 ppb have been measured in treated effluent from chemical manufacturing facilities and up to 19 ppb in urban runoff catchments. In Yokohama, Japan, particulates in photochemical smog have been observed to contain from 5.1 to 42 ppm of PNP (Howard, 1989). Once in the aquatic environment, PNP poses a potential threat to biota, as it is a known uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (Anders, 1985), which has been observed previously in red abalone (Haliotis rufescens ) exposed to pentachlorophenol (PCP; Tjeerdema et al., 1991a,b, 1993; Shofer et al., 1996) and to 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol

(TFM; Viant et al., 2001). Uptake, disposition and biotransformation of various phenolic compounds in aquatic organisms have been studied previously (Foster and Crosby, 1986; Tjeerdema and Crosby, 1992; Benner and Tjeerdema, 1993; Gates and Tjeerdema, 1994; Shofer and Tjeerdema, 1993; Tjeerdema et al., 1994; Williamson et al., 1995), but fate of PNP in red abalone has not been reported. Metabolic reactions observed for PNP are expected to be similar to those of other phenolic compounds, such as di- and tri-nitrophenols, PCP and TFM. Thus, PNP may be considered a model phenol for prediction of metabolic reactions in red abalone. PNP lends itself to metabolic study because it is less toxic than many other nitrophenolic compounds, such as dinoseb (2-[1-methylpropyl]-4,6-dinitrophenol; Gasiewicz, 1991), and is readily available in 14C-labelled form. This investigation describes the absorption, disposition, biotransformation, and elimination of PNP in red abalone. Absorption and elimination rate constants are determined, as well as the total concentration factor (TCF) for PNP and its metabolites. Tissue disposition is described, and depurated PNP and metabolic products are identified and quantified.

produced using reverse-osmosis treated deionized water and 40 Fathoms artificial sea salts (Marine Enterprises International, Baltimore, MD). 2.2. Animals Small abalone (ca. 2.5 cm in length) for rangefinding toxicity tests were obtained from The Cultured Abalone (Goleta, CA). Large abalone (ca. 8 cm; average tissue wet weight of 30.5 g) for kinetic and biotransformation experiments were obtained from Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, CA) and housed in a recirculating artificial seawater system. Temperature was maintained at 149/2 8C and animals were fed giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera ) once per week. Large abalone were acclimated for at least 2 months prior to testing. 2.3. Toxicity range finding To determine an appropriate sublethal exposure concentration for the kinetic and biotransformation experiments, a toxicity range-finding test was conducted. Small abalone were exposed to concentrations of PNP (static, non-renewal, five abalone per treatment) ranging from 0 to 360 mM (0 to 50 ppm) for 6 h; the endpoint was lack of tentacle extension. 2.4. Exposure and depuration

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Chemicals PNP (I), p -aminophenol (II), p -nitrophenyl-bD-glucopyranoside (III), p -nitrophenyl sulfate (IV) and p-nitroanisole (V) were obtained from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). 14C PNP (ring-labelled, 6.1 mCi mmol (1) and p-acetamidophenol (VI) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Scintiverse LC scintillation cocktail, Scintigest tissue solubilizer and sodium sulfate (anhydrous) were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Calcium sulfate (anhydrous) was purchased from W.A. Hammond Drierite Co. (Xenia, OH). Amberlite XAD-7 resin was purchased from Sigma and was sequentially cleaned with methylene chloride and methanol via Soxhlet extraction prior to use. Artificial seawater (32 /34 ppt) was Large abalone were individually exposed for 24 h to 800 ml of 3.6 mM PNP (149/2 8C) in 1 l beakers. One mCi of 14C PNP (specific activity of 6.1 mCi mmol (1) was used in each exposure, with unlabelled PNP constituting the remainder of the dose. Single-bubble aeration was provided by an aquarium air pump. Two 200 ml aliquots of exposure water were collected at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 45 min, and continuing at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h and were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting (LSC) on a Packard Tri-Carb 2000 CA Liquid Scintillation Analyzer. A system control, with no abalone, was included to measure loss of PNP due to either volatilization or glass adsorption. At the end of the exposure period, abalone were rinsed and transferred to a flow-through, recircu-

lating metabolism chamber, as described by Benner and Tjeerdema (1993). Briefly, a 1 l waterjacketed reaction chamber, connected in series to an XAD-7 resin column, was filled with clean seawater (149/2 8C). The water was then recirculated using a Masterflex pump at a rate not exceeding 2 ml min (1 to collect depurated PNP and metabolites. To control for microbial metabolism, another XAD-7 column was spiked with PNP and was connected to a metabolism chamber containing an unexposed abalone. After 24 h, abalone were removed and immediately frozen ((/20 8C) for later dissection, and the XAD-7 resins were vacuum-dried and frozen ((/20 8C) for later analysis. 2.5. Tissue analysis Gill, digestive gland and foot muscle were dissected from each of the three abalone that were exposed to PNP for 24 h without depuration, and from each of three abalone that were both exposed to PNP and then allowed to depurate for another 24 h. Dissected tissues and remaining body tissues (everything except gill, digestive gland and foot muscle) were minced and approx. 0.1 g samples were weighed and placed in scintillation vials. Scintigest was added (0.5 ml per 0.1 g tissue for muscle and body; 0.865 ml per 0.1 g tissue for gill and digestive gland; Kobayashi and Maudsley, 1974). Samples were incubated for 5 days at 60 8C and then were analyzed by LSC for retained residues. Tissue concentrations were determined on a wet weight basis. 2.6. Metabolite extraction XAD-7 resin was sequentially extracted with 50 ml of methylene chloride and 100 ml of ethanol. Analyte recoveries were reported by Williamson et al. (1995) to be 103, 106, 91, 102, 73 and 105% for I, IV, VI, V, II and III, respectively. Methylene chloride extracts were dried over a column of sodium sulfate and calcium sulfate (both anhydrous). Extracts were combined and reduced to approximately 12 ml by rotary vacuum evaporation, filtered (0.2 mm), then reduced to less than 1 ml under N2 at 40 8C. They were then filtered (0.2

mm) again, further reduced to 200 ml under N2 at 40 8C, and then frozen for later analysis.

2.7. Metabolite analysis Resin extracts containing metabolites were analyzed using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) co-chromatography and LSC. A HewlettPackard 1090 integrated HPLC (Palo Alto, CA) with a diode-array detector (254 nm) and a Gilson Model 203 fraction collector (Middleton, WI) were used. Two different HPLC methods were employed to confirm metabolite identity. First, an Econosil reverse-phase C18 column (250 )/ 4.6 mm, 5 mm; Alltech Associates, Inc., Deerfield, IL) was used with a gradient mobile phase of 0.1% acetic acid:methanol (97:3, v/v, changed to 75:25 over 9 min and held for 9 min, then changed to 20:80 over 3 min and held for 5 min, then changed to 97:3 over 3 min; 1.0 ml min(1). Second, a Chromegabond reverse-phase C22 column (250 )/ 4.6 mm, 5 mm; ES Industries, West Berlin, NJ) was used with a gradient mobile phase of 0.1% acetic acid:acetonitrile (95:5, v/v, for 4 min, then changed to 70:30 over 10 min and held for 2 min, then changed to 40:60 over 4 min and held for 6 min, then changed to 95:5 over 8 min; 1 ml min (1). Reverse phase C18 guard columns (7.5 )/ 4.6 mm, 5 mm) were used for both methods. Fig. 1 shows elution profiles for PNP plus five metabolites using both methods. Fractions were collected and analyzed for 14C by LSC. For the C18 method, 1.0 ml fractions were collected initially, 0.2 ml fractions were collected to resolve the middle three peaks, and 0.5 ml fractions were collected for the final two peaks. For the C22 method, 0.75 ml fractions were collected throughout.

2.8. Statistical methods Uptake data were analyzed by the least-squares method to determine a best-fit line. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student's t-tests were used to determine significance of differences between concentrations of residues in gill, digestive gland, foot muscle, and remaining body tissues.

3. Results 3.1. Uptake and disposition From the range-finding test, a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for PNP of 3.6 mM (0.5 ppm) was determined. No significant loss of PNP via volatilization or adsorption to glass was observed in the system control test. Results of the uptake experiments may be described by a two-compartment model to which the following equilibrium applies: Cw ?Ct ;
ke ka

uptake by the animal may be calculated from measurements of 14C in water over time. Fig. 2, in which water concentrations of PNP equivalents (PNP plus metabolites) have been converted to whole-animal concentrations, shows that equilibrium was reached after approximately 12 h of static exposure. A ka value of 0.129/0.04 h(1 was obtained from a plot of ln(Cw/Cw0) versus time for the first 20 min of exposure when, by assumption, elimination does not yet occur (Cw0 0/water concentration at time 0). At 24 h, Cw 0/3.329/0.10 mM and Ct 0/7.869/0.02 mmol kg (1 (from tissue analysis). At equilibrium, Cwka 0/Ctke. With measured values for Cw, Ct and ka, ke may then be calculated to be 0.059/0.02 h(1; which gives a half-life (t1/2) of ln(2/ke)0/12.99/0.02 h. The conditional uptake clearance, ku, as described by Landrum and Crosby (1981), Landrum et al. (1992) accounts for effects of animal size and water volume on the rate of uptake. A ku value of 3.29/1.1 ml g(1 h (1 was calculated using the formula ku 0/ka(Vw/Mo), where Vw is the volume of water (ml) and Mo the mass of the organism. This value represents the volume of water cleared of chemical per hour per gram tissue. From 24 h Cw and Ct values, a TCF (TCF) may be calculated. This value differs from the bioconcentration factor in that it includes concentration of the parent compound, PNP, and any metabolites (Landrum and Crosby, 1981; Spacie and Hamelink, 1982; Tjeerdema and Crosby, 1987,

where ka is the absorption rate constant, Cw the concentration of PNP and metabolites in water, ke the elimination rate constant, Ct the concentration of PNP and metabolites in tissue or whole-animal (tissue'/shell). Mass balance for this model requires that any 14 C lost from the water compartment must be absorbed by the animal compartment, and thus

1992). Given that TCF 0/Ct/Cw, a TCF of 2.379/ 0.07 may be calculated from a Ct of 1.099/0.003 mg kg(1 (wet weight) and Cw 0/0.469/ 0.01 mg l(1. Radiolabelled residues did not distribute evenly into various tissues (Fig. 3), as the highest concentrations after 24 h were found in gill tissue (11.89/0.2 nmol g(1), while digestive gland, foot muscle and remaining body tissue attained significantly lower concentrations (8.89/0.9, P 0/ 0.03; 7.79/0.6, P 0/0.003; and 7.59/0.6 nmol g(1, P 0/0.003, respectively). Digestive gland, foot muscle and remaining body tissues did not differ significantly from each other (P B/0.05). For ease of comparison to whole-animal, TCF values were calculated for gill, digestive gland, foot muscle and remaining body tissues (3.569/1.23, 2.669/0.29, 2.329/0.19, and 2.279/0.21, respectively). Fig. 3A also indicates that quantifiable residue levels remained in tissues after the 24 h depuration period, though in gill, digestive gland, foot muscle, and body tissues these were reduced by 83, 88, 92, and 89%, respectively. Differences between tissues after depuration were not significant (P 5/0.05).

3.2. Metabolism Fig. 4 shows the metabolic pathways for PNP (I) in red abalone; no metabolites were detected in the microbial control. While results for C18 and C22 HPLC methods were averaged for I and IV, metabolites V and VI were not detected via the C18 method, due either to the small fraction size, or to overlap of I and V; only C22 results are given. Compounds I, IV, V and VI comprised 87.59/3.1, 13.19/3.1, 0.329/0.09, and 0.149/0.07% of recovered 14C, respectively.

4. Discussion The absorption and elimination rate constants (ka 0/0.12 h(1; ke 0/0.05 h(1) indicate that abalone absorb PNP at a faster rate than they are able to eliminate it. This is in contrast to results obtained by Williamson et al. (1995) in which black turban snails (Tegula funebralis) absorbed PNP at a rate slower than their elimination rate (ka 0/0.06 h(1, ke 0/0.84 h (1). Similarly, abalone were found to slightly concentrate PNP and metabolites in tissues (TCF 0/2.37), while snails did not (TCF 0/0.13). The log octanol /water partition coefficient (log Kow) for PNP is 1.91 (Howard, 1989), indicating that while very water soluble (11,300 /25,000 mg l (1, depending on temperature), it is slightly more soluble in lipids and is expected to bioaccumulate to a modest degree. The ku for abalone, 3.2 ml g(1 h (1, is nearly identical to the value of 3.28 ml g(1 h(1 for snails, indicating that the two gastropod molluscs, gram for gram, are able to absorb PNP from water at similar rates. In red abalone, gill tissue accumulated the significantly higher residue concentrations (11.8 nmol g(1) than other tissues sampled (7.7 nmol g(1 in foot muscle, 8.8 nmol g(1 in digestive gland, and 7.5 nmol g(1 in remaining body tissue). This is in agreement with studies of PCP disposition in red and green abalone (H. fulgens ) in which gill concentrations were among the highest (133.4 and 141.6 nmol g(1 for red and green abalone, respectively), with only viscera in red abalone having a slightly higher concentration (136.2

nmol g(1; Tjeerdema and Crosby, 1992; Shofer and Tjeerdema, 1993). Likewise, in both red and green abalone, foot muscle concentrations were somewhat lower than gill tissue at 109.1 and 130.3 nmol g(1, respectively. Although abalone gill tissue accumulates relatively high concentrations of PNP and other phenols, the total mass of gill tissue is extremely small (400 mg average in this study), thus the total mass accumulated is small (Fig. 3B). Clearly foot muscle, with large mass and moderate tissue concentration, accumulated the most total residue. Fig. 4 shows the metabolic pathways for PNP in red abalone. Similar to other studies, most of the PNP (87.5%) was depurated unaltered by red abalone. Turban snails depurated 96.1% as unaltered PNP (Williamson et al., 1995), while green abalone, oysters (Crassostrea gigas ), red abalone, topsmelt (Atherinops affinis ), and striped bass (Morone saxatilis ) depurated 72.5, 88.8, 89.3, 64.9, and 71.5%, respectively, of parent PCP (Shofer and Tjeerdema, 1993; Tjeerdema and Crosby, 1992, Benner and Tjeerdema, 1993; Gates and Tjeerdema, 1994). However, Tjeerdema et al. (1994) observed that purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ) depurated only 17% of PCP as parent. In this study, IV represented the major metabolite (13.1%), while V and VI were found in very small quantities (0.32 and 0.14%, respectively). Williamson et al. (1995) found that

turban snails exposed to PNP produced 1.7% IV, 0.5% V, 0.3% II, and 1.4% VI. Studies of PCP metabolism by aquatic organisms have reported 0.6 /20.3% sulfate conjugates and 5.6 /16.2% glucoside conjugates (Shofer and Tjeerdema, 1993; Tjeerdema and Crosby, 1992; Benner and Tjeerdema, 1993; Gates and Tjeerdema, 1994). Tjeerdema et al. (1994) observed 72.4% of PCP residues depurated by sea urchins as the glucoside conjugate. Apparently sea urchins, with a high TCF (316.39/209.7; Tjeerdema et al., 1994), are not readily able to depurate unaltered PCP, but must produce a conjugate prior to elimination. Foster and Crosby (1986) found very high levels of glucoside conjugates produced by crayfish exposed to p-nitroanisole, 4-nitro-m cresol and methyl parathion; the major metabolite for all three compounds in crayfish was PNP. Neither red abalone nor turban snails produced glucoside conjugates with PNP, which is somewhat surprising given that PCP-glucoside conjugates were produced in significant levels (5.6/15% of recovered metabolites) by both red and green abalone (Tjeerdema and Crosby, 1992; Shofer and Tjeerdema, 1993), and in very high levels (72.4% of recovered residues) by sea urchins (Tjeerdema et al., 1994). Likewise, PNP-glucoside conjugates were produced at very high levels (up to 57.9% of recovered residues) by crayfish (Foster and Crosby, 1986). Biochemical differences (i.e.

P.L. TenBrook et al. / Aquatic Toxicology 62 (2003) 329 /336

different enzymes and cofactors) could explain interspecies variability, but would not completely explain same-species variability. An alternative to consider is substrate availability. Hall et al. (2001) have proposed that, e.g. plants readily produce glucoside and amino acid conjugates because these compounds are abundant in the plant. However, soil microbes need glucose and amino acids for nutrients and cannot afford to use them for conjugation reactions. Likewise, differences in phenolic conjugation products between species and between same-species studies (under different test conditions) may be due to differences in available sulfate versus glucose in the test system (water plus animal). For example, in seawater sulfate is abundant, thus sulfate is potentially available for conjugation reactions. Similarly, variable laboratory feeding regimens may lead to variable glucose availability. Another possible explanation for the differences in conjugations in turban snails, red and green abalone, and oysters is that exposure times were quite different. In studies by Tjeerdema and Crosby (1992), Shofer and Tjeerdema (1993), animals were exposed for 5 h, while in both the study by Williamson et al. (1995) and this study animals were exposed for 24 h. Uptake of PNP and other phenols has been described in various marine and estuarine species by a hyperbolic curve (Benner and Tjeerdema, 1993; Tjeerdema et al., 1994; Williamson et al., 1995) with the tissue concentration rising sharply in the early minutes of exposure and then tapering off as equilibrium is approached. In this study, the uptake curve is sigmoidal (Fig. 2), indicating a biphasic uptake, with an initial plateau at 1/8 h. This apparent biphasic process could be a result of a shift in conjugation/elimination mechanism. It may be that glucosides were produced during the first hours of exposure and then were eliminated. As glucose supplies were depleted, sulfation occurred more readily, such that only sulfate conjugates were recovered after a longer exposure period. To conclude, red abalone are able to absorb PNP and depurate most of it unchanged. Metabolic reactions, particularly sulfation, do occur, but to a limited extent. Under conditions of constant exposure, abalone bioconcentrate PNP

and related residues, but only to a modest degree. Differences in phenol metabolism between red abalone in this study, and red and green abalone in other studies, would seem to indicate that PNP metabolism by red abalone is not a good predictive model for phenolic metabolism in red abalone. However, the more general prediction that phenols are primarily depurated unchanged does appear reasonable.
