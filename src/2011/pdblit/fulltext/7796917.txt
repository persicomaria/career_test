Abstract A putative uridine-binding site of uridine phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.3) from E. coil was modified with fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate (FITC). Treatment with FITC irreversibly inactivates the enzyme (K i = 1.0 mM, k 2 = 0.15 min l). Under the conditions of 90% inactivation the incorporation of the reagent reaches about 1 mol per mol of the enzyme subunit. Addition of uridine prevents the enzyme inactivation by FITC. In contrast to this, addition of a second substrate phosphate increases the rate of inactivation by 2.3-fold (k 2 = 0.34 min- 1), but has no effect on the affinity of the reagent to the enzyme. The modified protein retains the ability to bind phosphate but not uridine. According to differential absorption spectroscopy data, the binding of phosphate to the active site of the enzyme is accompanied by conformational changes which may accelerate the inactivation rate. The data presented suggest that in the UPase FITC occupies the putative uridine-binding site, while the phosphate-binding site still retains the ability to interact with the second substrate.

1. Introduction Uridine phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.3) (UPase) catalyzes the phosphorolysis of uridine and is involved in the degradation of pyrimidine nucleosides and their utilization as carbon and energy sources in E. coli cells [1,2]. The structural gene encoding the synthesis of UPase has been cloned on multicopy plasmids and a strain overproducer of UPase has been isolated [3]. The enzyme molecule consists of six identical subunits ( M r 27.5) [4,5]. The primary structure of UPase was deduced from its nucleotide sequence [6], the kinetic scheme was suggested [7] and the X-ray analysis is now in progress [4,8]. However, the nature and structure of the UPase active site remains unknown. It was suggested that the histidine residue plays an important role in the catalytic activity of this enzyme [9].

In the present study we used fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate (FITC) for modification of the active site of UPase from E. coli K-12. We found that FITC inactivates UPase and most probably interacts with an amino group in the putative uridine-binding site.

Enzymes and materials. Uridine phosphorylase was isolated from E. coli strain K-12, as described previously [8], with a specific activity of 180-200 I U / m g . The assays of uridine phosphorylase activity [1] were carried out using spectrophotometer Graficord UV-240 (Shimadzu, Japan). FITC was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), [5,6-3H]uridine was obtained from Amersham (UK). Other chemicals were reagent grade and used without further purification. Modification of UPase. Inhibition kinetics was studied by using various concentrations of inhibitor at 20°C for over 15 min. The reagent (0.1-5 mM) was added to the protein (0.1-3 m g / m l ) in a 50 mM veronal buffer solution (pH 7.6) and the enzymatic activity was as-

sayed spectrophotometrically [1]. The reagent excess was removed by gel filtration. The reagent's incorporation was calculated from spectrophotometric data. After gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column, the concentration of covalently bound fluorescein in the sample was determined by measuring the absorbance at 495 nm, using a value of 80 000 M - ] · cm-] for the extinction coefficient of fluorescein [10]. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry [11] and by absorbance at 280 nm [1]. After SDS-PAGE [12] the fluorescent band was visualized with a handheld UV lamp with nominal emission of 366 nm. Gels were stained by immersion in a solution of 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 in ethanol, acetic acid and water (45 : 10 : 45, v/v). After 1 h at room temperature, the background was destained with the same solution without dye.

(0.5 mM, 100 tzl), in a Tris-HC1 buffer solution (pH 7.0) with 5 mM [3H]uridine were run on a Sephadex G-50 column (2 ml volume) equilibrated with the same buffer. After elution with a system used to equilibrate the column the 50/zl fractions were tested for radioactivity and protein concentration. Differential spectroscopy. Difference spectra of phosphate complexes of UPase and FITC-modified UPase (FTC-UPase) were recorded in the range of 240-300 and 400-550 nm, correspondingly, using a UV-240 (Shimadzu, Japan) spectrophotometer with the sensitivity of 0.05 absorbance unit/scale. Both measuring and reference cuvettes of 1-cm pathway contained 0.6 ml enzyme solution. After the base line had stabilized, 1-30 tzl portions of stock phosphate solution were successively added to the measuring cuvette, each followed by addition of the same volume of the buffer to the reference cuvette. All solutions used in spectral studies had been passed through an ultrafilter with a pore size 1.2 tzm.

tion (data not shown). The last result indicates that hexamer dissociation did not take place during modification. The reagent was not released by incubation with 1.0 M hydroxylamine (pH 7.5) for 2 h at 25°C or in the conditions of sample preparation, and SDS gel electrophoresis. Thus the sulfhydryl groups may not be involved in the inactivation process. The above results suggest that FITC-induced inactivation of UPase is caused by the reaction of FITC with an amino group which locates close to or in the active site of the enzyme.

3. Results

Stoichiometry of the reaction of UPase with FITC Inactivation of UPase by FITC
As shown in Fig. 1, incubation of UPase with FITC resulted in a progressive decrease in enzyme activity. After incubation for 15 min with 5.0 mM FITC in 50 mM veronal buffer (pH 7.6), less than 10% of the original activity was retained. The inactivation obeyed pseudo-first-order kinetics (Fig. 1A), the rate of inactivation increased with FITC concentration and exhibited saturation kinetics with a Ki of 1.0 mM and a maximum rate constant of 0.15 rain -1 (Fig. 1B). The modified enzyme was not reactivated by dilution, dialysis, or gel filtration. Native and modified UPase showed identical mobilities during SDS-PAGE and gel filtraAfter removing FITC by gel filtration the absorption spectra and the specific enzymatic activities of the native and modified UPase were compared. In the spectrum of the modified enzyme at 495 nm a band typical for the fluorescein was found. The inactivation rate was found to correlate with the incorporation of the reagent (Fig. 2).

Effect of added substrates on inactivation
The inactivation of UPase by FITC was specifically protected by preincubation of the enzyme with 5 mM uridine. This suggests that FITC-induced inactivation of UPase is caused by the reaction of FITC with the

amino group which may be located close to or in the putative uridine-binding site. On the other hand, the addition of phosphate accelerated UPase inactivation as shown in Fig. 3A. By increasing the concentration of phosphate from 0 to 50 mM it was possible to rise the rate of inactivation about 2 times and the midpoint of the transition corresponds to a Kdelt a of 6.0 mM (Fig. 3A). For this reason we studied the effect of saturating concentrations of phosphate on the kinetic parameters of enzyme inactivation by FITC. As in the case without phosphate the inactivation obeyed pseudo-first-order kinetics, the rate of inactivation increased with FITC concentration and K i' and kj were 1.4 mM and 0.34 min-Z, respectively (Fig. 3B).

Equilibrium gel filtration of the modified enzyme
To test if the modification affected the binding of [3H]uridine to the modified enzyme the equilibrium gel filtration method was used. The results presented in Fig. 4 indicate no radioactivity of modified enzyme above base level. While UPase bound about 1 tool of the uridine per mole of subunits under the same conditions. Thus the modification caused by FITC dramati-

The stoichiometry of modification and UPase residual activity were deterrninated as described under Materials and Methods.

The differential spectroscopy method was used to test whether the modification affected the binding of phosphate to the modified enzyme. The addition of phosphate induced ultraviolet difference spectra of the native UPase as shown in Fig. 5A. The difference spectrum induced by phosphate was a positive one, and two peaks at 287 and 279 nm for the native enzyme were observed. A visible positive difference spectrum with a peak at 510 nm was found upon the addition of phosphate to the modified UPase (data not shown). In both cases the increase of phosphate concentration from 1 to 20 mM led to the most significant changes in spectra and the midpoint of the transition was about 5.0 mM both for K,] (279 nm) and K~' (510 nm) (Fig. 5B). It is similar to K m for phosphate (7.3 raM; [1]). This correlation allows to suggest that modified UPase has the same ability to bind phosphate as the native enzyme does.

Pi" FITC, E-FTC- Pi are, respectively, complexes of native or modified UPase with corresponding ligands. The finding that uridine protects the enzyme from inactivation while the modified enzyme losses its ability to bind this substrate leads to the conclusion that the fluorescein group interacts with the putative uridinebinding site. The increase of Ki as compared to K~ (Table 1) is probably due to the structural differences between the substrate and reagent. The addition of a second substrate - phosphate causes a increase of the inactivation rate (k~/k 2 = 2.3) without affecting the enzyme affinity to the reagent (Ki, Ki' , Table 1). Since the formation of the enzyme-phosphate complex is accompanied by a change in the UPase absorption spectra and also by an increase of the inactivation rate constant it seems reasonable to suggest that active site of enzyme undergoes conformational changes. Moreover, the attachment of negative charged phosphate near the reacting amino group can facilitate its deprotonation, increase nucleophilicity and thereby accelerate of the enzyme inactivation rate by FITC. The values of constants which characterize phosphate-binding to UPase (K,], K,]' and Kdelta) presented in Table 1 are in accordance with the published data [1]. The similarity between Kin, Kd, Kdelta and K 0 allows to conclude that FITC modification does not

The data obtained allow to suggest that in modified UPase the fluorescein residue is located in the putative uridine-binding site while the modification does not involve the phosphate-binding site. It seems possible that the amino group that reacts with FITC is also not essential for the manifestation of the UPase enzymatic activity. Nevertheless, it is apparent that UPase modified with FITC can serve as a convenient tool for studying the structural-functional interactions of this enzyme.

affect the ability of the enzyme to bind the second substrate - phosphate. Earlier FITC has been used to localize the nucleotide-binding site in ATPases. It is supposed that FITC binds to the part of the ATP-binding site that is normally occupied by the adenine ring [13], just as iodinated fluorescein derivatives have been found to bind at these sites in lactate dehydrogenase [14] and yeast hexokinase [15]. In ATPases FITC interacts with the lysine residue which is located in the conserved amino acid sequence (Table 2; marked with an asterisk) [16,17]. The comparison of primary structures of different ATPases and UPase [6] revealed some definite homology (Table 2). But the significance of this homology should be confirmed directly by the isolation of a peptide, containing the modified residue. Subsequently, by using the method of site-directed mutagenesis for Ca2+-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum of the rabbit skeletal muscle [16,18] and (Na +/K +)-ATPase from Torpedocalifornica [19] it was established that the lysine residue that reacts with FITC is not essential for the manifestation of enzymatic activity. Hence, in ATPases the lysine residue that reacts with the isothiocyanate group is probably located near the FITC-binding site, and its modification takes place after the reagent is bound in the active site of the enzyme. These data are in good agreement with the suggestion that in ATPases FITC sterically
