Targeting the p40 cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 in Crohn's disease

In a recent study in which Crohn's disease patients were treated with an antibody targeting IL-12p40, 75% of patients exhibited a significant clinical response. The antibody in question blocks two related cytokines, IL-12 and IL-23. This encouraging clinical result prompts us to more fully understand the role of these cytokines and their individual contributions to the inflammatory pathways that underlie the disease. Introduction
Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any portion of the gastrointestinal tract including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small and large intestine, and anus but is most common in the ileum ­ the lowest portion of the small intestine, where it connects with the large intestine [1]. Flare-ups of the disease manifest themselves with diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and sometimes rectal bleeding (http://www.ehealthmd.com/ library/crohnsdisease/CD_whatis.html/). Approximately 500,000 people in the US and over a million people worldwide are affected by CD. Although the cause of CD is not known, the disease has a genetic component and likely represents a dysregulated immune response to the normal environment in the gut. Traditional treatment options for CD include immunosuppressive drugs such as sulfasalazine and steroids. More recently, several biologically targeted treatments are being investigated, with infliximab, a chimeric anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, leading the way as the first approved biologic agent, and adalimumab, a

fully human anti-TNF antibody, in late stage clinical development for the treatment of CD [2].

Role of IL-12 and IL-23 in animal models of autoimmune and inflammatory disease
IL-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of p35 and p40 subunits; p35 mRNA is constitutively expressed in most cells, whereas p40 mRNA is upregulated in monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells in response to infection or other activating agents. IL-12 has been identified as a critical cytokine at the nexus of innate and adaptive immunity. It induces IFN-g production from NK and T cells, which contributes to phagocytic cell activation as well as inflammation, and plays a key role in defense against infection with bacteria and intracellular pathogens. The adaptive immune response, which requires antigen presentation by dendritic cells and subsequent T cell differentiation to a Th1 or Th2 type lineage, is dependent on the cytokine milieu. IL-12 drives differentia¨ tion and proliferation of naive T cells along the Th1 lineage, resulting in production of IFN-g [3]. Overproduction of IL-12 has been correlated with enhanced proinflammatory activities and tissue damage typical of organ-specific autoimmunity in several mouse experimental models [4,5]. Most animal studies in which IL-12 was inhibited with neutralizing antibodies or through gene knockout (KO) targeted the p40 subunit of IL-12, now also known to be a component of the related cytokine IL-23 [6,7]. IL-23 is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of a p19 subunit and the

Figure 1. T cell differentiation into specific T helper (Th) cell lineages is dependent on the cytokine milieu. IL-12, a heterodimer of p40 and p35 subunits, drives the Th1 lineage, resulting in the production of IFN-g. The cytokine IL-4 drives the Th2 lineage and the recently identified Th17 lineage is induced by TGF-b1 and IL-6. IL-23, a heterodimer of p40 and p19 subunits, stimulates Th17 cells leading to production of IL-17. Both IFN-g and IL-17 have pro-inflammatory roles, however, in mouse models IFN-g has also been shown to have an anti-inflammatory role, possibly due to its ability to inhibit the differentiation of the Th17 lineage.

p40 subunit of IL-12. IL-23 affects memory T cell and inflammatory macrophage function, and stimulates a unique lineage of Th cells, named Th-17, characterized by production of the proinflammatory mediator IL-17. Therefore, the conclusion that IL-12 plays a key role in driving these autoimmune diseases should minimally be expanded to include IL-23 as well (Fig. 1). In fact, in several mouse models of autoimmune inflammation, it has become apparent that IL-23 rather than IL-12 is the essential cytokine. Using gene-targeted mice lacking only IL-12 (p35 KO) or IL-23 (p19 KO), it has been shown that the specific absence of IL-23 is protective, whereas loss of IL-12 exacerbates collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [8,9]. Similarly,

complete loss of IFN-g resulted in exacerbated disease as well [10]. In fact, anti-IL-12p40 antibodies were still efficacious in IFN-g receptor-deficient mice with CIA, indicating that the mode of action for the anti-IL-12p40 antibody in this model does not involve the IL-12/IFN-g pathway [11]. The anti-inflammatory role of IL-12 and IFN-g became better understood through several studies showing that the IL-23driven development of Th-17 cells is induced if IFN-g and IL-4 are neutralized [12,13]. The results from studies in animal models of colitis follow for the most part, a similar paradigm in which antibodies to IL-12p40 prevented and/or abrogated established colitis in mice, but inhibition of IFN-g had minimal or no effect [14­16]. By contrast, studies with hapten-induced colitis in mice deficient for IL-12p40 or IL-12p35 showed that, surprisingly, IL-12p40 KO mice had more severe disease than IL-12p35 KO mice, and that more severe colitis was associated with high-level colonic IL-18 expression [17]. With this one exception, the overall picture that unfolds is that blockade of either IL-12 and IL-23 through targeting p40 or IL-23 alone through targeting p19 is efficacious in reducing and/or reversing autoimmune inflammation (Table 1). The paradigm that has emerged from autoimmune and inflammatory models in mice suggests that the IL-12/IFN-g pathway is mostly anti-inflammatory, whereas the IL-23/IL-17 pathway is involved in the inflammatory response resulting in the disease manifestations. The biphasic nature of low dose IL-12 and IFN-g acting as proinflammatory mediators able to drive autoimmune disease [4,5], and high dose IL-12 having anti-inflammatory activity has been described previously [18]. The dual role of IFN-g as a proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory agent has been clearly established in mice and explains why in mouse models of autoimmune disease blockade of IL-23 is as effective as blockade of IL-12 and IL-23. However, it is premature to translate the findings in mouse models to human disease. Both the IL-12/IFN-g and the IL-23/IL-17 pathways may contribute to the inflammatory response in human disease, as IFN-g does not appear to play a similar protective

Box 1. Preclinical models suggest that IL-23, not IL-12, is the critical cytokine driving inflammatory and autoimmune disease in the mouse.
 Is this owing to the biphasic nature of IL-12 and IFN-g as proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators during onset and chronic inflammation, respectively, as observed in animal models?  Is this translatable to human disease?

Box 2. IL-12 and IL-23 are both associated with human CD.
 Is IL-23 the `critical' inflammatory cytokine or is the IL-12-driven Th1 environment also contributing to the inflammatory state in human CD?  Will blocking IL-23 alone be as efficacious in human CD as blocking IL-12 and IL-23?

anti-inflammatory role in human disease as has been observed in the mouse models [19]. In this context, it is particularly interesting that a recent study with fontolizumab, an anti-IFN-g antibody, demonstrated clinical activity in patients with CD, suggesting that IFN-g has a proinflammatory rather than an anti-inflammatory role in human CD [20]. Consequently, our full understanding of the role of the IL12 and IL-23 pathways in driving human autoimmune and inflammatory disease will need to await clinical data with therapeutic agents targeting these cytokines (see Box 1).

The etiology of human Crohn's disease
Crohn's disease is characterized by a transmural inflammation of the intestinal tract that is the result of defects in mucosal immunity [21]. Patients with active CD have an increase in intestinal permeability allowing the mucosal immune system to be exposed to potential harmful pathogens and foreign antigens, resulting in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and T cell differentiation. CD is associated with an excessive CD4+ Th1 response resulting in enhanced production of IFN-g and TNF-a. Other markers of Th1 cells, such as expression of the transcription factor T-bet, the high-affinity b2 chain of the IL-12 receptor, and activated STAT4, all indicate that the mucosal environment in Crohn's

disease, but not in ulcerative colitis, is skewed toward Th1 polarization as a result of overexpression of IL-12 [22]. Elevated levels of IL-23 transcripts were detected in colonic mucosa from CD patients and showed a correlation with the severity of the endoscopic lesion [23]. In addition, transcript and protein levels of the IL-23-induced proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 were elevated in the mucosa and serum of both CD and ulcerative colitis patients [24]. The individual contribution of IL-12-driven Th1 responses and IL-23-driven Th17 responses to disease initiation and maintenance of chronic inflammatory disease is not yet understood (see Box 2) [25].

T cell apoptosis
Mucosal T cells from healthy individuals are susceptible to apoptosis, allowing a normal balance of regulatory to effector T cells in the gut. In CD, lamina propria T cells become resistant to activation-induced T cell apoptosis leading to an increase in CD4+ T cells in the mucosa. These findings suggest that it is the persistence and accumulation of T cells that drives tissue injury [26]. The mechanism by which anti-IL-12p40 treatment affects colitis likely involves the restoration of the normal regulatory to effector T cell balance.

The induction of mucosal Th1 cell apoptosis is mediated by the Fas pathway, as has been shown in mice with experimental colitis [27]. In fact, mice with colitis that received an inhibitor of the Fas pathway were resistant to anti-IL-12p40 treatment.

Clinical studies
Several companies are entering the clinic with therapeutics targeting the IL-12/IL-23 pathway (Table 2). Synta Pharmaceuticals (http://www.syntapharma.com/) is investigating STA-5326, a novel, orally-administered, small molecule drug candidate that selectively and potently inhibits the production of the IL-12 cytokine family, including IL-12 and IL-23. The mechanism by which STA-5326 exerts its activity is not understood. The company disclosed at the Digestive Disease Week in May 2005 that in a 4-week open-label Phase IIa study, treatment with STA-5326 at daily doses of 35 mg and above demonstrated clinically meaningful response and disease remission rates in patients with CD [28]. STA5326 appears to demonstrate an acceptable safety profile with dizziness, nausea and headache as the most common drugrelated adverse events. Subsequently, the company has initiated a multinational, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase IIb trial examining the efficacy and safety of STA-5326 in patients with active Crohn's disease. If effective, the potential of a once-daily, oral therapy targeting IL-12 and IL-23 production will be a significant clinical benefit for patients with CD. Protein Design Labs (http://www.pdl.com/) focused their research and development on the SMARTTM anti-IL-12 antibody, which is specific for IL-12p70. This was based on the rationale that by specifically targeting IL-12p70 and not excess free p40, one would block biological activity of IL-12 whereas maintaining the potentially antagonistic activity of the p40 homodimer [29]. Owing to the lack of binding to p40, this antibody does not inhibit the newly identified cytokine IL-23. Although a Phase I study was initiated in 2002, the company has discontinued the clinical development, when it became apparent that blockade of IL-12 alone is not likely to be sufficient to achieve efficacy. Two companies are developing antibodies that target the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23. Abbott's (http://www.abbott. com/) ABT-874 is a fully human IgG1, l antibody isolated from a human antibody phage display library and optimized in collaboration with Cambridge Antibody Technology Inc (http://www.cambridgeantibody.com/) [30]. Centocor's (http://www.centocor.com/) CNTO 1275 is a fully human IgG1, k antibody generated in human immunoglobulin transgenic mice by Medarex (http:// www.medarex.com/) [31]. Both antibodies have high affinity for IL-12p40 and potently inhibit IL-12 and IL-23 biological activity.

CNTO 1275 appears highly effective and well tolerated in several early psoriasis trials [31,32] and is in Phase III development for psoriasis and Phase II for multiple sclerosis. Centocor has also initiated a study in Crohn's patients. The company is currently enrolling patients in a Phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CNTO 1275 for reducing the signs and symptoms of active CD. Patients with moderate to severe CD will be randomized to one of the four treatment groups to receive active drug or placebo by subcutaneous or intravenous administration during the 28-week study. Certain standard CD medications, including steroids and immunomodulators, are permitted as co-medications during the study. Mannon et al. [33] have described the results of a placebocontrolled double-blind Phase II study with Abbott's anti-IL12p40 antibody, ABT-874, in 79 patients with active Crohn's disease. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ABT874 in patients receiving subcutaneous injections of ABT-874 at doses of 1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg. Patients were randomized in two cohorts. Cohort 1 received seven weekly doses with a 4week interval between the first and second dose, whereas Cohort 2 received seven consecutive doses without interruption. Efficacy endpoints included a clinical response (defined by a reduction in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] of at least 100 points) and remission (defined by a CDAI score of 150 or less). Patients in Cohort 2 receiving ABT-874 at 3 mg/kg exhibited a higher clinical response rate than patients receiving placebo (75% versus 25%, P = 0.03) at the end of the 7-week treatment. The remission rate in this group was not significant at the end of dosing (38% versus 0%, P = 0.07). The apparent sustained response rate, which was 75% at the end of dosing and 69% at 18 weeks postdosing, suggests that anti-IL-12p40 treatment may result in a pharmacodynamic effect that extends beyond the pharmacokinetic effect expected from an antibody with a terminal half-life of 9 days in humans. It is tempting to speculate that this phenomenon may be the result of restoration of normal T cell apoptosis in the mucosa. Mucosal biopsies taken from a subset of Crohn's disease patients pre- and post-treatment with ABT-874 showed a post-treatment improvement of the mucosal histologic score and allowed for a more detailed study of cytokine responsiveness by mucosal lamina propria mononuclear cells. Decreased secretion of IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-17 by stimulated T cells and decreased secretion of IL-12 and IL-23 by stimulated antigen-presenting cells were associated with clinical improvements in patients treated with ABT-874 [33,34].

Potential safety issues related to IL-12 and IL-23 blockade
IL-12, through induction of IFN-g, plays a key role in the host defense of mice to a variety of intracellular bacterial, fungal and protozoan pathogens [35]. IL-12p35 KO mice, lacking

only IL-12 but not IL-23, are less sensitive to T. gondii infection than IL-12p40 KO mice, which lack both IL-12 and IL-23, indicating that IL-23 may play a limited role in host defense as well [36]. Human patients unable to produce or respond to IL-12 and IL-23 owing to a mutation in the p40 subunit or the IL-12Rb1 subunit, all displayed a syndrome characterized by predis´ position to infection by Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and nontuberculous Mycobacteria, and by various nontyphi species of Salmonella [37­39]. T cells from these patients were deficient, but not wholly lacking, in their ability to produce IFN-g. Notwithstanding, the patients could generate normal delayed-type hypersensitivity responses, and their T cells proliferated normally. Vigilance for the occurrence of such infections in patients treated with anti-IL-12p40 agents is warranted. Increased susceptibility to viral or unusual fungal infections has not been reported in patients with IL-12p40 deficiencies [37­39]. Failure to observe an increased incidence of viral infections in these patients is consistent with reports that IL-12p40-deficient mice display normal virus-induced Th1 responses and T cell-mediated control of viral infections, despite a total inability to produce bioactive IL-12 or IL-23 [40].

Concluding remarks
Preclinical research performed a decade ago pointed to the important role of IL-12 blockade in an animal model of Crohn's disease [14]. Since then our understanding has grown significantly with the discovery of IL-23 and the inflammatory cytokines it induces from a new subset of T cells, named Th-17 cells. IL-23 has been identified as the key cytokine to inhibit in animal models of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the interplay of IL-12driven Th1 responses and IL-23-driven Th17 responses have not been interrogated in the clinical setting of any inflammatory disease. The clinical efficacy of anti-IL-12p40 blockade in Crohn's patients indicates that T cells and cytokines of the IL-12/IL-23 pathway are key drivers of the disease. Moreover, it is clear that the mechanisms underlying Crohn's disease include not only inhibition of inflammatory responses but also restoration of normal apoptosis of mucosal T cells. Whether treatment with an anti-IL-23 antibody will result in comparable efficacy to anti-IL12p40 treatment, while maintaining the protective role of IL-12 in host defense against pathogens, will need to await clinical testing.
