The X-ray structure of human trypsin 1 has been determined in the presence of diisopropyl-phosphofluoridate by the molecular replacement method and refined at a resolution of 2.2 Å to an R-factor of 18%. Crystals belong to the space group P4, with two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit packing as crystallographic tetramers. This study was performed in order to seek possible structural peculiarities of human trypsin 1, suggested by some striking differences in its biochemical behavior as compared to other trypsins of mammalian species. Its fold is, in fact, very similar to those of the bovine, rat and porcine trypsins, with root-mean-square differences in the 0.4 to 0.6 Å range for all 223 Ca positions. The most unexpected feature of the human trypsin 1 structure is in the phosphorylated state of tyrosine residue 151 in the present X-ray study. This feature was confirmed by mass spectrometry on the same inhibited sample and also on the native enzyme. This phosphorylation strengthens the outstanding clustering of highly negative or highly positive electrostatic surface potentials. The peculiar inhibitory behaviour of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitors of the Kazal type on this enzyme is discussed as a possible consequence of these properties. A charged surface loop has also been interpreted as an epitope site recognised by a monoclonal antibody specific to human trypsin 1.

Introduction
Trypsins are among the major secretory products of the human pancreas, activated from trypsinogen upon cleavage by enterokinase at the entrance to the duodenum. They, in turn, activate other pancreatic proteases. In humans, two major isozymes (trypsins 1 and 2) have been isolated. The two trypsins show 89% sequence identity, as

deduced from the cDNA (Emi et al., 1986), but exhibit slightly different responses to trypsin inhibitors (Figarella et al., 1975) and present different epitopes to monoclonal antibodies (GuyCrotte et al., 1992). These functional and antigenic differences become more significant when human trypsins are compared to the bovine enzyme in spite of the fact that they show about 75% sequence identity with the latter. These observations and additional ones, such as differences in the autoactivation rates of the corresponding zymogens (Colomb et al., 1979), suggest distinct conformation features for human trypsins. The determination of the X-ray structure of the more abundant isozyme trypsin 1 (htr1) was undertaken to obtain structural information that may be useful in interpreting htr1 properties at the atomic level. A considerable number of high-resolution X-ray structures of serine proteases, alone or complexed with various inhibitors, have been determined in recent years (see, for instance, the review by Bode & Huber, 1992). This wealth of information allows

comparative studies that should lead to a better understanding of the modes of action of the proteases and their interaction with inhibitors. The first X-ray structure of trypsin was determined for the bovine protein (Huber et al., 1974). It has been refined at high resolution in different crystal forms (Chambers & Stroud, 1977, Protein Data Bank ° (PDB) code 4PTP, 1.34 A resolution; Bartunik et al., ° resolution). High-resolution structures 1989, 1.5 A have also been reported for porcine trypsin (Huang et al., 1993) and native and mutant rat trypsins (Earnest et al., 1991; Perona et al., 1993a,b). In mammalian species, the different isozymes are classified, depending on their isoelectric point, as cationic (pI > 7.0) or anionic (pI < 7.0). Charge distribution along the sequence appears to be very similar within each cationic and anionic trypsin group (Pinsky et al., 1985), while human trypsin 1 shows intermediate features. Peculiarities of its charge distribution will thus be analyzed in the three-dimensional space.

Results
Quality of the structure The standard crystallographic R-factor of the refined model of diisopropyl phosphofluoridate (DFP)-inhibited human trypsin 1 (htr1) is 0.177 ° for data between 10 and 2.2 A, with 300 water molecules included. Final refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The two independent molecules of the asymmetric unit, designated here as molA and molB, show an overall rms difference ° of 0.3 A after rigid-body superposition. This value may be compared to the rms coordinate error of ° approximately 0.25 A estimated from a Luzatti plot (Luzatti, 1952). The conventional chymotrypsinogen relative amino acid residue sequence numbering (Hartley & Shotton, 1971) will be used throughout. The model is well defined in the electron density except for a few small regions (Figure 1); a main-chain real

space correlation (Jones et al., 1991) value lower than 0.7 is only observed at positions 37 to 38, 147, 169, 173, 175 and 221 for molB; a side-chain real space correlation lower than 0.5 is only observed at position 23 for molA and positions 37 and 175 for molB. As the two molecules of the asymmetric unit are similar, molA, which is slightly better defined in the electron density, will be used as a reference molecule for analysis and comparison with other trypsin molecules.

replaced by a proline residue and a tyrosine residue, respectively. In addition, the high proline content (3/5) of the 124 to 129 human segment was believed to induce local changes in conformation. This region is well defined in the electron density (Figure 5(a)) and presents a slight but significant divergence at position 129 (Figure 5(b)). This is the only position where such a divergence is observed relative to all other known trypsin three-dimensional structures.

Active site A scaffold similar to that of other mammalian trypsins
Superposition of human trypsin onto bovine, rat and porcine trypsins, displayed in Figure 2, shows ° an rms deviation below 0.6 A for the 223 Ca positions of the molecules (Table 2). Additional comparison statistics are also given in Table 2. ° Distances of more than 1.5 A are only observed in the following zones (Figure 3): 23 to 26, 61 to 62 and 129 for bovine trypsin; 24 to 26, 129, 149 and 192 for rat trypsin, and only 129 for porcine trypsin. The largest positional deviation is observed at Glu24 ° (>3 A) when compared to the bovine structure. Conformation changes relative to the bovine structure were expected from the sequence differences (Figure 4) in the region where the cysteine residues of the 128-232 disulfide bridge are The majority of the DFP inhibitor covalently bound to Ser195 is well defined in the electron density map corresponding to the active site region (Figure 6). However, only one isopropyl group has matching electron density, as well observed in the DFP-inhibited bovine trypsin (PDB code 4PTP, Chambers & Stroud, 1977). No negative peak in the Fourier difference map contoured at a level of 3s appears after introduction of the second isopropyl group in the htr1 model. Although there is no evidence for the presence or absence of this second isopropyl group from this structural study, mass spectrometry results (see below) clearly establish its presence.

observed for the two independent molecules of the asymmetric unit. This tyrosine residue modification was verified by analysis of energy-minimized ° omit-maps, where a sphere of 8 A around the phosphorus atom is removed from the phase calculation procedure. An aliquot of the sample used for crystallization was analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry in order to verify this unexpected chemical modification of Tyr151. The major fraction (ca. 80%) of the sample has a molecular mass of 24,348 (22) Da (data not shown), corresponding to an addition of 244 Da to the theoretical 24,104 Da molecular mass calculated from the htr1 sequence. This corresponds to a fixation of a diisopropyl phosphoryl (dip) group (+164 Da) on the active Ser195 plus a phosphate group (+80 Da) on Tyr151. To check that the observed phosphorylated state of Tyr151 was not an artefact induced by the high excess of DFP, the same analysis was carried out on a sample of native human trypsin 1. The ESI mass spectrum is shown in Figure 8. A coherent series of multiply charged ions, corresponding to molecules bearing from 11 to 16 charges is clearly observed. The measured molecular mass of 24,184 (22) Da is 80 Da higher than the isotope-averaged mass deduced from the amino acid residue sequence. This mass difference exactly corresponds to the addition of a phosphate group. Phosphorylation of Tyr151 is thus clearly confirmed.

Autolysis site
Autolysis is known to occur in htr1 samples in the absence of inhibitor. The major autolysis site was determined by protein co-sequencing of the first 14 residues of the partially proteolyzed trypsin; in addition to the normal N-terminal sequence of trypsin, the following sequence was determined; Val-(Ser,Leu)-Thr-Ile-Ser-Leu-Pro-Thr-Ala-Pro-ProAla-Thr-Gly, arising from the cleavage of the Arg117-Val118 peptide bond. This autolysis site is also present in bovine trypsin (Maroux et al., 1967). By contrast, the bovine Lys145-Ser146 autolysis site, present in the so-called ``autolysis loop'' (Bode & Huber, 1986) does not exist in the human enzyme which carries an alanine residue instead of a lysine residue at position 145. In the crystal structure, continuous density is observed for the main chain of residues 117 and 118, suggesting the absence of autolysis in the crystalline sample. As in the case of other limited proteolytic sites (Hubbard et al., 1991), this region is protruding from the surface of the molecule and ° presents high temperature factors (>50 A2 ). Crystal packing and temperature factors The two molecules of the asymmetric unit are packed as crystallographic tetramers around each 4-fold symmetry axis in the P4 cell (Figure 9). The non-crystallographic symmetry operation re-

999 crepancy is observed for the first domain, where the stabilization through tetrameric association is the same for the two independent molecules. This analysis also led to the observation that the usual distribution within the protein volume (lower B-factors in the core region, higher B-factors as the surface) is only respected if each of the crystallographic tetramers is considered as one entity. Comparison of surface features with other trypsin three-dimensional structures

lating molA to molB is defined by a 180° rotation about an axis located in the (x, y) plane ((x, y, z) = (0.22, 0.4, 0.0)); compared to molA, molB tetramers are in a reverse orientation relative to their 4-fold axis and have different crystal packing environments on the (x, y) plane (Figure 9). The tetramer interface is a significant component of crystal packing (2/3 of total contacts), involving 16% of the total surface area of the htr1 molecule with two ionic bonds, five hydrogen bonds and 88 van der Waals contacts per monomer. This kind of tetrameric packing has not been previously observed and may be specific to the human enzyme; ten of the 32 residue types implicated in the tetramer interaction are different in the bovine enzyme (e.g. the Glu74 to Lys236 salt bridge). The mean temperature factor value was esti° mated from a Wilson plot to be 30.6 A2. This compares well with the value obtained after ° refinement of the model; 32.9 A2. To understand such high individual temperature factors, their distribution was further analyzed in conjunction with the packing environment. Discrepancies in temperature factors between the two molecules of the asymmetric unit are observed (Table 1). They increase when the two trypsin domains are taken into account separately (Table 3); temperature ° factors 10 A2 higher are observed for the second domain in molB when compared to its counterpart in molA. This second domain protrudes into a large ° channel (48 A as its larger dimension, see Figure 9) in the case of molB whereas it is stabilized by crystal packing in the case of molA. Less dis-

Similar primary binding sites
Based on the behavior of some inhibitors it was suspected that htr1 could have a higher affinity for lysine than for arginine at the primary binding site (S1 , using the general nomenclature introduced by Schechter & Berger, 1967). Consequently, a more thorough comparison with the bovine enzyme has been made in this region. An rms distance of only ° 0.26 A (corresponding to the estimated coordinate error) between the main-chain atoms was observed when considering all the loops defining the edges of the S1 pocket; 189 to 195, 213 to 216, 219 to 220 and 226 to 228 (64 atoms). In the two species the amino acid residue sequence is identical in this region.

Surface charges distribution

surface residues; the active site is located between two distinct zones of positive and negative charges (Figure 10). Numerous charged groups are found at the surface of htr1, although the net charge calculated at neutral pH is only -0.5. In comparison, the calculated net charge is 5.0 for bovine trypsin (cationic), and -7.5 for the rat enzyme (anionic). The surface distribution of charged groups on htr1 is similar to the anionic enzymes in some areas,

similar to cationic enzymes in other areas (C-terminal part) and unique elsewhere. Several charged residues are found in the vicinity of the binding sites (Figure 10). Lys60, which is close to subsite S'3, is found in all mammalian trypsins. Arg96, Lys97 and Lys175, more distant from the binding sites, are found only in the human and rat enzymes. The most striking feature is the presence of Asp217 and phosphorylated Tyr151,

which are specific to htr1. These two acidic residues are located close to the binding sites and correspond to the strongest negative potentials of the molecule. Clusters of acidic residues are also found more distally from the binding sites; in the ``calcium binding loop'' (there is no calcium in the present structure) as in all trypsins, and in the two neighboring 23 to 25 and 150 to 154 loops (Figure 10, lower part). These two loops contain five acidic residues in htr1, four in rat trypsin, while no acidic residues are present in the bovine and porcine enzymes.

Discussion
The X-ray study presented here clearly establishes that the human trypsin 1 tertiary structure is similar to that of other known trypsin structures (Table 2), with limited conformational differences in some surface loops. This was expected from the high level of sequence identity (Table 2; Chothia & Lesk, 1986) and the high degree of structure conservation in this family, although not fully supported by some biochemical data (Figarella et al., 1975; Guy-Crotte et al., 1992).

features occurring at the surface of this enzyme will be analyzed in detail and discussed in relation to its biochemical properties. Phosphorylation of Tyr151 and mass spectrometry analysis of human trypsin 1 In this X-ray study, we found Tyr151 in the unexpected phosphorylated state. The total molecular mass, as obtained by mass spectrometry, confirms this observation. Whether this phosphorylated state was physiological or artefactual remained uncertain in the first step of the analysis; DFP, used in a very large excess in the enzyme preparation because of the very slow kinetics of inhibition of htr1 (Figarella et al., 1975) could have reacted not only with the active site serine residue, but also with the nearby Tyr151. Indeed, the observed molecular mass of DFP-inhibited human trypsin 1 was also compatible with the hypothesis of a fixation of DFP at the active site and on Tyr151,

with further hydrolysis of one isopropyl group on each site, with the same type of ``aging process'' as observed on DFP-inhibited chymotrypsin (Harel et al., 1991). The recent covalent labeling of bovine trypsin Tyr151 with p-diazonium benzamidine (Goreti de Almeida Oliveira et al., 1993) also indirectly supported this hypothesis of possible artefactual fixation of DFP, even though there are no nearby charged residues that could enhance the tyrosine reactivity; the only polar atoms found in the environment of the hydroxyl group are Asn143 ° ° ND2 (3.8 A) and Gln192 O (4.8 A; Figure 7). Mass spectrometry results on non-inhibited human trypsin 1 clearly establish the presence of the phosphorylation in the native state of the enzyme (Figure 8). This phosphorylation appears to be physiological, although it is the first observation of this kind for this type of enzyme. No ``aging'' process of DFP in the active site The absence of matching electron density maps for one isopropyl group of the inhibitor bound at the active site could result either from disorder or from hydrolysis of this group as observed with bovine chymotrypsin (Harel et al., 1991). The difference of 164 Da between the molecular masses of native and DFP-inhibited enzymes gives clear evidence for the presence of the full dip group in the inhibited enzyme. Thus, some fine differences appear at this level between DFP inhibition of trypsins and chymotrypsins. This may be reflected, at the atomic level, by the presence of a conserved water molecule in monoisopropyl phosphoryl

In both trypsins, the primary binding subsite (S1) clearly appears as a large hole of strongly negative potential, which provides their specificity for basic residues.

(mip)trypsins (htr1, 4PTP) which interacts with His57 Ne2 (Figure 6). In the case of the DFP-inhibited chymotrypsin structure, this water molecule is absent and a stronger hydrogen bond exists between His57 Ne2 and the charged O1 of the inhibitor which results from the dealkylation reaction (Table 4).

Analysis of surface loop modifications in relation to the response to monoclonal antibodies One of the biochemical indicators of structural peculiarities of htr1 was the ability to generate specific monoclonal antibodies (Guy-Crotte et al.,

1004 1992). The major structural difference observed between human trypsin 1 and the bovine or rat enzyme, loop 23 to 26, may be postulated as the putative epitope recognised by the monoclonal antibody Mab G6. In fact, it differs significantly ° both in position (rms on main-chains is 2.3 A, Figures 2 and 3) and charge (Figure 4) from the other trypsins. The large mobility (temperature ° factor >70 A2 ) of this loop may help in antibody recognition. Moreover, several biochemical observations are consistent with this identification. (1) Cross-immunoreactivity of Mab G6 has only been observed with dog trypsinogen (Guy-Crotte et al., 1992). This may be supported by the very high local sequence identity in this area, with the presence of only one conservative substitution between dog and human sequences (Figure 4). (2) An increase of the measured activity of htr1 in the presence of Mab G6 has been observed (Guy-Crotte et al., 1992). This putative epitope is distant from the active site, but near to the Arg117 autolysis site (Figure 2). Thus, the increase in measured activity may be due to the protection provided against autolysis. (3) Different affinity constants have been reported for this antibody towards the two human trypsins (Guy-Crotte et al., 1992). This may be due to structural differences in the putative epitope region which result from the non-conservative substitution of Asn by Ile at position 21 in the human trypsin 2 sequence (Figure 2). As a final argument, it may be noted that this putative epitope is close to the 22-157 disulfide bridge, correlating with the observed lack of immunoreactivity after protein reduction by 2-mercaptoethanol (Lafont et al., 1990). Interpretative analysis of htr1 structural properties in relation to the observed interactions with inhibitors of the Kazal type The striking inhibition differences of bovine and human trypsins by human, porcine and bovine secretory pancreatic trypsin inhibitors (SPTIs) suggested the existence of structural differences at or around the active site; whereas bovine trypsin is

fully inhibited by each of the SPTIs, human trypsins are only inhibited at a 100% level by human SPTI, 75% by porcine SPTI and 0% by bovine SPTI (Figarella et al., 1975). Except for the phosphorylation of Tyr151 and for some peculiarities of the distribution of charges around the active site (Figure 10), the X-ray structure of htr1 is very similar to those of other trypsins. Having determined the structure of the uncomplexed htr1, we can only discuss the surface features that may play a role in the recognition of these Kazal-type inhibitors.

Comparative localisation of the inhibitor/enzyme interface and htr1 surface-specific features
The available X-ray structures of complexes between a SPTI an a serine (pro-) protease are the following; porcine SPTI and trypsinogen (Bolognesi et al., 1982; PDB code 1tgs); human variant 3 SPTI (humv3) and chymotrypsinogen (Hecht et al., 1991; PDB code 1cgi). Footprints of inhibitor binding as observed in these complexes are shown in Figure 11. They look very similar in their overall shape and orientation of the major binding subsites (S1 to S4, S' to S'3), and match in this area the invariant part of trypsin's electrostatic surface potential at the S1 (Asp189) and S'3 (Lys60) subsites. However, differences in these footprints show the flexibility of these inhibitors in their N-terminal part (see S5 to S9 in Figure 11) and for the orientation of their central i33 to i39 helix (see s32, s36, s39 and s40 in Figure 11). This flexibility partly defines a common mode of action of this family of inhibitors of broad specificity (Read & James, 1986; Hecht et al., 1991, 1992); the precise orientation relative to the target enzyme is modulated through hinge movements on both sides of the active site (the i10 to i13 and i23 to i25 segments). The specific surface features occurring on htr1 (Figure 10) are in the vicinity of these modular parts of the footprints; phosphorylated Tyr151 is near s32 and Asp217, Lys175, Lys97 and Arg96 are near the S5 to S9 region.

Fine analysis of amino acid substitutions occurring at the interface between the different trypsins and inhibitors
Because of the flexibility of the inhibitors in their binding region, molecular modeling of their association to htr1 may be misleading in its fine details. Therefore, the analysis of the amino acid substitutions occurring at the interface between trypsins and inhibitors (Table 5) will focus on the medium-range interactions of charged residues. These interactions are likely to have significant effects in defining enzyme specificity and should be less sensitive to minor errors in fine spatial orientation. The potential ionic bonds (in addition to the one defining the primary specificity) which may guide the specificity of interaction between

O3 is the oxygen atom stabilized in the oxyanion hole (193 NH and 194 NH). O1 is the oxygen atom from which the second alkyl group is hydrolyzed in mip-chymotrypsin because of the ``aging process''. The water molecule is conserved in the trypsin structures and is absent in the chymotrypsin structure.

htr1 and hSPTI are the following; Lys60 with Asp i21 (hSPTI), Arg96 (htr1) with Glu i12, Asp21 (htr1) and Lys i43 (hSPTI). The slight difference in the inhibition rates of htr1 by hSPTI and pSPTI may be correlated to the Asp/Asn substitution at position 21 (subsite P' ) 3 which is facing Lys60 of trypsin. Indeed, the chymotrypsin inhibition properties of hSPTI variants appear to be very sensitive to mutations at

position 21 (Hecht et al., 1991). Another argument comes from the screening of substrate analog trypsin inhibitors with bovine trypsin (Eichler & Houghton, 1993), where a significantly more powerful inhibitor is obtained when Asp (instead of Asn) is chosen at subsite P3' after a Lys-Ile-Tyr sequence. This last observation also stands for the P2 subsite, where Thr leads to better inhibition than Pro.

Selected possible determinants of the htr1-hSPTI specific interaction; elements of the interface between the enzme and inhibitor. Only the positions where different residue types occur in the human species (htr1 or hSPTI) are listed. The distance values are evaluated from a simple model of the interaction between htr1 and hSPTI extrapolated from the complex humv3-chymotrypsinogen (Hecht et al., 1991), and are only indicative in the area of flexibility of the inhibitor (see the text). h, Human; b, bovine; p, porcine.

However, the most puzzling observation is the absence of htr1 inhibition by bSPTI (Figarella et al., 1975). Except for the primary P1 binding site (Arg i18 instead of Lys i18), the major binding residues of bSPTI (i10 to i21) are identical in sequence to the corresponding residues in hSPTI or pSPTI (Figure 12). However, an enhanced Lys to Arg primary specificity in htr1 relative to the bovine enzyme is

Figure 13. View of the face of the hSPTI central helix directed towards htr1 Asp217, colored as a function of the atomic electrostatic potential. The specificity of hSPTI results from its basic residue Lys i43 and hydrophobic residues Val i36 and Phe i39. Electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions may induce a tighter contact to htr1 in this area. In the case of bSPTI, Glu i43 together with the nearby Glu i40 induces a highly negative potential. Figure produced using Grasp (Nicholls et al., 1991).

ruled out by the very high similarity of their S1 subsites. Peculiarities in the bSPTI sequence are only found in or near the C-terminal helix, at positions i29, i36, i39 and i43 (Figure 12 and Table 5). The most striking substitution is found at position i43, where opposite charges are found; Glu in bSPTI instead of Lys in hSPTI and pSPTI. This corresponds to the face of the a-helix oriented towards Asp217, where an attractive electrostatic positive potential is observed in the case of hSPTI (Figure 13). In the opposite case of bSPTI, the glutamic acid residue in position i43, adjacent to Glu i40, will induce an electrostatic repulsion towards Asp217. Phosphorylation of Tyr151 induces steric hindrance for the binding of residues i31 and i32, which may promote a shift of this helix towards Asp217. This shift would also favor hydrophobic contacts for the specific residues Val i36 or Phe i39 of hSPTI. Lastly, this C-terminal helix is held to the N-terminal binding region by the two disulfide bonds i9-i38 and i16-i35. This normally contributes to a better stability of the inhibitor-enzyme complex by preventing the dissociation of the cleaved inhibitor. But in the case of bSPTI, an electrostatic repulsion of the C-terminal helix may favor the dissociation of the inhibitor through these disulfide bridges. This, together with the absence of Asp i21 and Thr i17, as noted for pPSTI, may be enough to enable the dissociation of the inhibitor from the enzyme.

area detector. X-rays were produced by a Rigaku RU200 X-ray generator equipped with a graphite monochroma° tor (l = 1.5418 A). The processing of the data using the XENGEN package (version 2.0; Howard et al., 1987) indicated that the space group was P4. Solvent content is ca. 50%, with two molecules per asymmetric unit (Vm is ° 2.4 A3/Da; Matthews, 1968). Data were then collected to ° 2.2 A resolution using the W32 synchrotron beam port at LURE (Orsay, France) on a MAResearch image plate ° detector (l = 0.9 A) at 4°C. The crystal-to-detector distance was 200 mm. A total of 90 images were collected with a 1° oscillation range and 90 second exposure time. Unscaled intensities were obtained by using the program MOSFLM (version 5.1; Leslie, 1987). These intensities were subsequently reduced and scaled with ROTAVATA and AGROVATA (Collaborative Computation Project 4, 1994). Table 6 summarizes the data statistics.

In conclusion, the present study has enabled us to correlate some of the observed peculiarities in the biochemical properties of htr1 to its surface specific features; Asp217 and phosphorylated Tyr151 are likely to influence the selective binding of the C-terminal helix of the Kazal-type inhibitors and loop 23 to 26 is proposed as the putative epitope of monoclonal antibody Mab G6.

Materials and Methods
Protein purification Trypsin 1 was obtained by autocatalytic activation of trypsinogen 1 partially purified from human pancreatic juice. Activation was performed by dialysis overnight in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) buffer containing 20 mM CaCl2 and 200 mM NaCl. The active enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography on Sepharose coupled with benzamidine (Pharmacia) under the same conditions as those described for the purification of human trypsin on Sepharose bound to pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Figarella et al., 1984). Purified trypsin 1 was inhibited by incubation with DFP in a 1000-fold molar excess at pH 7.8 for 24 hours and then dialyzed against 1 mM HCl, before lyophilisation. Mass spectrometry Mass spectrometry analyses were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer Sciex API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a nebulizer-assisted electrospray (ionspray) source. The spectra were recorded in the 1500 to 2400 range of mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios in steps of 0.5 m/z, with a 2 ms dwell time. The signal was averaged over six scans. The ionspray probe tip was held at 5 kV and the orifice voltage was set at 80 V. After a step of dialysis in water to remove salts, human trypsin was dissolved in water:methanol:acetic acid (74:25:1, v/v/v), pH 2.6 at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. It was infused into the source using a Harvard 22 syringe pump at a flow rate of 5 ml/minute and a Valco C6W injector equipped with a 1 ml internal loop. Crystallisation Crystals of DFP-inhibited human trypsin 1 (htr1) were grown by the hanging- or sitting-drop vapor-diffusion technique. The wells contained 14 to 16% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000, 2 to 3% (v/v) dioxane, 50 mM TAPS (pH 8.5 or 8.6). Crystals only appeared within this very fine pH range. Droplets initially contained 3.6 ml of a 41 mg/ml protein solution mixed with 2.6 ml of a well solution. Large tetragonal crystals of up to 1 mm in length appeared after a week at 20°C. They ° diffracted to beyond 2.2 A using synchrotron radiation. Dioxane was utilized to reduce twinning and increase the diffracting power of the crystals as previously observed for chymotrypsin (Sigler et al., 1969; discussed by McPherson, 1989). Data collection ° X-ray intensity data to 3 A resolution were collected at room temperature using a Siemens/Xentronics multiwire

Structure determination The structure of htr1 was determined by molecular replacement using bovine trypsin (Bartunik et al., 1989), code 1TLD from the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977; Abola et al., 1987), as a search model. The orientation of the molecules in the unit cell was determined using the AMoRe program (Navaza, 1994). Rotation and translation functions lead to clear solutions for the two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. After a few steps of rigid-body least-square minimization (Navaza, 1994), the correlation coefficient on structure factors was 0.65 and the conventional crystallographic R-factor was 0.37 for data between 15 ° and 3.5 A resolution.

Model building and structure refinement ° A 3 A Fourier map with (2Fo - Fc ) coefficients clearly displayed the two independent trypsin molecules and additional density for the DFP inhibitor and for the extra serine C-terminal residue. Refinement was carried out with the program X-PLOR version 3.1 (Brunger et al., ¨ 1987). After a cycle of simulated-annealing refinement with non-crystallographic constraints, the R-factor dropped from the initial 0.44 to 0.30 for data between 8 ° and 2.2 A resolution. Amino acid residue side-chain replacements and the C-terminal addition were then introduced into the trypsin model to match the human amino acid residue sequence (Emi et al., 1986) using an Table 6.

ESV/20 graphics station (Evans & Sutherland) and the program O (Jones et al., 1991). Refinement then proceeded in the usual manner with iterative graphical inspection of Fourier maps with (2Fo - Fc ), (Fo - Fc ) and (3Fo - 2Fc ) coefficients using the program O and regular position refinement using X-PLOR alternating with solvent modeling steps using PROTEIN (Steigman, 1974). The two molecules of the asymmetric unit were independently refined. In the process of adding water molecules in the Fourier difference maps, two very strong peaks were located at ° a distance of 1.54 A from the Tyr151 hydroxyl group of each independent molecule in the asymmetric unit. These peaks, together with the large electron density peaks around them, were very strong indications of the phosphorylated state of this tyrosine residue. In order to reduce model bias, ``omit'' (2Fo - Fc ) electron density maps (Hodel et al., 1992) were calculated after 150 steps of positional refinement in areas where new features appeared relative to the bovine trypsin structure. Discrepancies of temperature factors in the crystal packing suggested the need for applying an overall anisotropic B-factor in order to account for possible anisotropic motion (thus, Btotal = Boverall anisotropic + ° Bindividual isotropic ). Values of -0.039 for b11 and b22 (-3.1 A2 ) ° and 0.042 for b33 (3.3 A2 ) were obtained, with a slight improvement of the R-factor (from 0.189 to 0.182).

Quality check and analysis of the final model At the final stages, the ARP program (Lamzin & Wilson, 1993) was used for the automatic addition of solvent molecules in the maps. Water molecules that were not positionally stable in the electron density after energy minimization were systematically excluded (real space correlation <0.6, as defined by Jones et al., 1991). The final residual difference Fourier maps show positive ° ° features at 0.36 e-/A3 and negative ones at -0.29 e-/A3, which confirms that no significant feature remains to be interpreted. Zero occupancy was set to atoms not defined in the (2Fo - Fc ) maps at a 0.5s level. Structural comparisons with other trypsin structures were performed using O (Jones et al., 1991), secondary structure assignments and surface accessibilities were calculated using DSSP (Kabsch & Sander, 1983), and crystal packing analysis by the local program Contact (A. Roussel & J. C. Fontecilla-Camps, unpublished work). Electrostatic potentials and footprints of inhibitor binding were displayed using Grasp (Nicholls et al., 1991). Here (using PDB notation), each arginine residue was assumed to have a charge of 0.5 at the nucleus of NH1 and NH2 and each lysine residue a charge of 1 at the nucleus of Ne; histidine residues, except for the active-site histidine, were assigned a net charge of 0.25 on each Nd and Ne atom, and aspartate and glutamate residues had a charge of -0.5 on each of carboxylate oxygens; the N-terminal amino group had a charge of 1 on the nitrogen atom, and the C-terminal carboxy group had a charge of -0.5 on each oxygen atom. The active site histidine residue had a net charge of zero. The footprint of the inhibitor was defined by a distance ° of 1 A from its van der Waals surface to the accessible surface of the enzyme (or zymogen) in the studied complex. Molecular coordinates are available through the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, code 1trn.
