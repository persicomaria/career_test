The three-dimensional structures of the catalytic residue Glu219 3 Gln mutant of Pseudomonas stutzeri maltotetraose-forming exo-a-amylase, and its complex with carbohydrate obtained by cocrystallization with maltopentaose were determined. Two crystal forms were obtained for the complexed enzyme, and a bound maltotetraose was found in each. The Ê Ê structures were analyzed at 2.2 A and 1.9 A resolution, respectively for the uncomplexed and complexed mutant. These structures were compared with the wild-type enzyme structure. In the complexed crystals, the maltotetraose was ®rmly bound, extensively interacting with the amino acid environments in the active cleft. The non-reducing end glucose unit was hydrogen bonded to the side-chain of Asp160 and the main-chain nitrogen of Gly158, which seem to be predominantly required for the recognition of the non-reducing end of the substrate that determines the exo-wise degradation of this enzyme. The reducing end glucose unit of bound maltotetraose showed clear deformation, adopting a half-chair conformation with extensive hydrogen bonds to surrounding polypeptides. The C1-atom of this deformed glucose unit lies very close Ê to Asp193OD1 with a distance of 2.6 A. The catalytic residue Asp294 is ®rmly hydrogen-bonded to the O2 and O3-hydroxyl groups of the deformed reducing end glucose unit. Upon binding of the carbohydrate, small but signi®cant induced ®ts were observed in the regions of Asp294, Phe156, Ile157, and Asp160. Possible roles of the three catalytic residues are also discussed.

Introduction
The a-amylase family comprises the enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of a-1,4-glycosidic linkages of starch components in a retaining fashion to produce oligosaccharides. It can be separated into two large classes of endo and exo-type enzymes depending on the nature of the point of degradation. The structures of most a-amylases thus far determined by X-ray crystallography are of the endo-type. These a-amylases were from sources of Aspergillus oryzae (Matsuura et al., 1984; Boel et al., 1990), Aspergillus niger (Boel et al., 1990),

porcine pancreas (Larson et al., 1994), barley (Kadziola et al., 1994), Bacillus licheniformis (Machius et al., 1995), and human saliva (Ramasubbu et al., 1996). Structure analyses of exotype amylases have been done for non a-amylases, soybean b-amylase (Mikami et al., 1994), and glucoamylase (Aleshin et al., 1992), and recently for an a-amylase, Pseudomonas stutzeri maltotetraoseforming exo-amylase (G4-amylase; Morishita et al., 1997). The structures of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases from Bacillus circulans (Klein & Schulz, 1991; Strokopytov et al., 1995) and Bacillus stearothermophilus (Kubota et al., 1991) have also been analyzed. Most of these structures have been further investigated in the presence of bound substrates or their analogs (Qian et al., 1994; Davies et al., 1995; Gilles et al., 1996; Strokopytov et al., 1996). These structure analyses have focused on re# 1997 Academic Press Limited

The family of a-amylases has in common a (b/a)8-barrel in the catalytic domain whose C-terminal side of the central b-barrel forms a wall of the active cleft. The three catalytic residues so far proposed, one glutamic acid and two aspartic acids, are conserved in the amino acid sequence and in the three-dimensional arrangement, residing at the bottom of the active site cleft. To study the structure-activity relationships of these enzymes, the structure analyses of the complexes with substrate or its analog are essential, and sometimes mutant enzymes are needed for binding of substrate. In the present structure analyses, we also used a mutant G4-enzyme to obtain ®rmly bound substrate. We describe here two crystal structures of a mutant enzyme in which the essential catalytic residue Glu219 has been replaced by Gln (E219Q) and cocrystallized with maltopentaose, in order to observe the structure of substrate-bound enzyme.

Since the structure of E219Q uncomplexed crystal was derived from the relatively less accurate data as shown in Table 5, the quantitative comparisons were not made.

Glu(Gln)219, Asp193, and Asp294 is tabulated for the deviations of side-chain atoms in Table 2. Structure of the active site and maltotetraose binding The maltotetraose binding site is located in the active site cleft at the C-terminal end of the b-sheet in the (b/a)8-barrel of the enzyme. This is the common site for substrate-analogue complexed structures of a-amylases and related enzymes (Matsuura et al., 1984; Boel et al., 1990; Larson et al., 1994; Kadziola et al., 1994; Klein & Schulz, 1991; Strokopytov et al., 1996). The overall view of the maltotetraose-complexed G4-amylase (E219Q) is shown in Figure 1. A close-up view of bound maltotetraose and amino acid environments is shown in Figure 2. The reducing end glucose residue (Glc4) is located so as to be surrounded by the catalytic residues, Gln(2Glu)219, Asp193, and Asp294. The average positional deviations in the side-chain atoms of the mutated Gln219 residue Ê from the wild-type crystal are 0.81 and 1.12 A, respectively, for the type 1 and 2 crystals. The nonreducing end glucose residue (Glc1) is located at the other end of the cleft, where it is bonded to the side-chain atom OD1 of Asp160 with the O4-hydroxyl, and to OD2 with the O6-hydroxyl group. The O4-atom of Glc1 is also hydrogen-bonded to the main-chain nitrogen atom of Gly158. The loop (residues 66 to 72) seems to interact with maltotetraose at the side-chain of Trp66. The hydrogen bonds between atoms in maltotetraose and its environments are shown in Table 3 for both types of complex crystals. The mode of binding maltotetraose is almost the same in these two crystals. The reducing end glucosidic residue (Glc4) is extensively hydrogen-bonded to the surrounding amino

Description of the structure
Overall structure The overall architecture and main-chain conformations of the molecule are almost identical to those of the wild-type enzyme (Morishita et al., 1997) , except in the region where the maltotetraose is bound in the active site in the complexed crystals. The geometries of the two bound calcium ions are also the same. The ligation of His13ND1 to the calcium ion was again con®rmed in the present structures. About 100 bound water molecules were Ê found at the same site within distances of 1 A among the wild-type and two complexed crystals. Buried water molecules found in the wild-type crystal (Morishita et al., 1997) were almost conserved. The disordered loop composed of the residues 66 to 72 was more rigid in the complex type 1 crystal, but still showed disorder in the type 2 crystal (a little less than in the wild-type, but with high temperature factors). At the side of this loop in the type 1 crystal, one molecule lies in close contact to the other molecule in the crystal, possibly restricting the movement of the loop. The lesser degree of this loop's disorder in the type 2 complex crystal than in the wild type might be a result of the binding of maltotetraose. The root-mean-square positional differences calculated by least-squares ®tting of the main-chain atoms between two molecules among the uncomplexed wild and two complexed E219Q are shown in Table 1. The mainchain atoms showed almost no positional change among the three crystals. Differences were observed in the side-chain atoms of Glu41, Asp124, Gln133, Tyr146, Arg196, and Gln347 between two maltotetraose-complexed crystals, probably because of different crystal packing.

acids. The side-chain of the mutated catalytic residue Gln219 seems to be weakly hydrogen-bonded to the O1-atom of Glc4 with a little longer interatomic distance. The glucosidic residues, Glc2 and Glc3, have fewer hydrogen-bonds with amino acid residues, making direct interaction only with Gln305 at Glc3, but each of the O6-atoms of these residues is hydrogen bonded to two-to-three bound water molecules that are linked to amino

acid environments. As shown schematically in Figure 3, the Glc2 and Glc3 residues seem to be directly supported on the surface of the enzyme principally by van der Waals interactions with the side-chains of aromatic residues, Phe79, Trp66, Phe156 and Trp25, and the hydrophobic Ile157. The ¯anking of the B-face of the sugar ring by tryptophan residues seems to be a characteristic feature in the protein-carbohydrate complexes

space (Tran et al., 1989), as tabulated in Table 4. As shown in this table and Figure 2, the reducing end glucose unit (Glc4) shows a more sudden rotation from Glc3 than do the other units. The most notable feature in the conformation of maltotetraose is that the reducing end glucose unit suffers a distortion from the regular chair conformation to adopt a half-chair form. The other glucosidic residues (Glc1, 2 and 3), on the other hand, adopt a normal chair conformation. The superimposition of the Glc4 glucosidic residue with Glc2 is shown in Figure 4, the feature of which is almost identical in the two types of complex crystal. Water structures in the active cleft The clusters of water molecules that had been found in the active cleft of the wild-type enzyme, Wat659, 661, 536, 660, 617, 628, and 664 (Morishita et al., 1997), were replaced by the bound maltotetraose. However, Wat509, 515, 665, and 666 were conserved in almost the same position among the wild-type and both complexed forms. Upon binding of maltotetraose, Wat591, 515, 665, 666, 685, 686, and 691 were found in both types of complexed crystals, as shown in Figures 2 and 3. In the type 1 complex crystal, Wat734, 766, 786, and 710 were newly introduced. The former three water molecules that were not found in type 2 complex were apparently bound as a result of the ordered loop (residues 66 to 72) ®lling the space between the bound maltotetraose. One water molecule, Wat718, is found uniquely in type 2 complex crystal, being hydrogen-bonded to the O3-atom of Glc3. The conserved bound water molecules between two complexed crystals shown in Table 3 and Figure 3 are further hydrogen-bonded to their environments as follows: Wat686 to Wat729 and further to Asn119ND2 and Gly121N; Wat685 to

(Spurlino et al., 1992; Qian et al., 1995; Knegtel et al., 1995). Conformations of maltotetraose The conformations of maltotetraose in the two types of complexes are quite similar, with a rootmean-square positional deviation of all atoms in Ê maltotetraose of 0.16 A. A f-c plot with respect to the glucosidic linkages showed that they all lie in the reasonable region of conformational energy

Two water molecules, Wat666 and Wat686, possibly make further hydrogen bonds with O5 of the pyranose rings, the former with Glc2 and the latter with Glc3, the average hydrogen-bond distances being Ê 3.3 and 3.0 A, respectively, as is found in the crystal structures of carbohydrates (Jeffrey, 1990). The Glc2 and Glc3 glucosidic residues are thus partly sustained by indirect contact with the surrounding amino acid residues via the bound water molecules.

arily result in complete loss of activity once the substrate is bound on the active site, due to contribution of other potential less active proton-donors, most probably those derived from water and/or solute molecules. Deformation of reducing end glucose unit The present structure analysis revealed a clear deformation of the cleaved reducing end glucose unit (Glc4) of the bound maltotetraose. Such a deformation has not yet been observed in other amylases and related enzymes. The most notable positional movement in the deformed glucose unit is that of the O5-atom of the pyranose ring, which Ê moves 0.54 A so as to make the plane of C1, C2, C4, C5 and O5 nearly coplanar, creating a sofa-like half-chair form, as shown in Figure 4, and displaÊ cing the O1-atom by 1.3 A toward the equatorial position. Similar features of deformation have also been observed in the structure analyses of lysozymes (Strynadka & James, 1991; Kuroki et al., 1993; Karlsen & Hough, 1995). In the present structures the deformation is considered a result of the compulsive forces of the extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions (Table 3 and Figure 3) of this glucosidic residue with the surrounding amino acids. The critical residues that might cause this deformation are presently being pursued by analyzing the structures of other complexed mutant enzymes. Structural changes upon binding of maltotetraose The signi®cant structural changes of amino acids in the region of the active site from the uncomplexed wild-type enzyme to the complexes are positional and/or orientational shifts of the sidechains of Asp294, Phe156, Ile157, and Asp160. This feature is shown in Figure 5. A reasonable interpretation of this change is that the side-chain of Asp294 moved to an optimum position to make hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of Glc4.

Discussion
Degradation of maltopentaose In the crystallization process of this enzyme, 10 mg/ml of maltopentaose was added with the aim of obtaining a maltopentaose complexed structure of mutant (E219Q) G4-amylase; however, we found only maltotetraose bound in the active site. Preceding this experiment, we cocrystallized maltopentaose with wild-type G4-enzyme and analyzed the resulting structure (data not shown), ®nding almost no electron densities that potentially corresponded to bound carbohydrate at the active site. Because the substrate was degraded into a product maltotetraose even when we used a biochemically inactivated mutant enzyme in the cocrystallization, it follows that the mutated enzyme still posesses very little activity. A similar degradation of substrate using inactivated mutant has been observed in a study of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (Klein et al., 1992). These facts do not necessarily mean that the mutant enzyme is contaminated with the wild-type one, or with Gln219deaminated enzymes. An experimental activity assay using a 1000-fold concentration of mutated enzyme detected the formation of maltotetraose (M.K., unpublished results). As described above, the cleaved-end glucose unit of bound maltotetraose in the active site of mutated enzyme caused a deformation that might be thought of as a premonitory structural feature for cleavage. These facts suggest that in the reaction pathway of this enzyme, Glu219 (proton-donating acid catalyst) is a great enhancer of catalytic activity, but the transformation of this residue to Gln does not necess-

However, the side-chain of Asp294 in the uncomplexed E219Q enzyme is oriented differently with wild-type and complexed enzymes, accompanying rearrangements of bound water molecules. These features imply the ¯exibility of the side-chain of Asp294, which probably serves to create a higher hydrogen-bonding ability upon binding of substrate. The comparative average temperature factors of the carboxylate atoms of the three catalytic residues, Asp193, Glu219, and Asp294 are 18, 21 Ê and 24 A2 for the uncomplexed wild-type, and 14, Ê 20 and 12 A2 for each residue averaged in the two types of complexes, respectively. Judging from these values, Asp193 is more ordered, Glu (Gln)219 is unchanged (although exact comparison cannot be made due to the change of residue), and Asp294 is quite well-ordered upon binding of maltotetraose. These facts suggest that Asp294 may play an important role for the interaction with substrate.

Loop structure The loop (66 to 72) which has been found disordered in the wild-type enzyme structure (Morishita et al., 1997) is less disordered in the complexed structures. In the type 1 complexed crystal, this loop is well ordered, with the temperature factors Ê of main-chain atoms ranging from 13 to 29 A2. This is apparently the result of a restriction of movement brought on by the close contact of the neighboring molecule at this site. In the type 2 complexed crystal, however, the crystal packing is identical to that of the wild-type, with an open space over this loop. In both of the complexed crystals, the Glc2 residue is ¯anked by the sidechain of Trp66, presumably helping to stabilize the loop structure. In fact, in the type 2 complex crystal, the loop is less disordered than in the wildtype, with the temperature factors of main-chain Ê atoms ranging from 32 to 51 A2 and showing faint

but visible electron densities. The amino acid sequence of this loop, SSWSDGSKSGGG (64 to 75), forms b-sheet-like hydrogen bonds between the residue pairs of 66:73 and 68:71, with the latter pair conforming to a b-turn at the top of the loop. The root of this loop is comprised of small side-chain amino acids, with three consecutive glycine residues at its C-terminal end, thus making the loop tend to protrude and sway in the solvent. Recognition of the non-reducing end As described above, the non-reducing end glucose residue of bound maltotetraose is hydrogenbonded to the side-chain of Asp160OD1 and the main-chain nitrogen of Gly158. The O6-hydroxyl is also hydrogen-bonded to Asp160OD2 and the water molecule Wat686. In the exo-type G4-amylase, the non-reducing end recognition seems to be accomplished predominantly by these interactions. The polypeptide segment Phe156 to Ala161 moved so as to adopt a conformation for the optimum binding of the non-reducing end glucose units. The respective maximum shifts of the side-chain atoms Ê of Ile157 and Asp160 are 1.5 and 1.2 A with marginal shifts of main-chain atoms. This feature is shown in Figure 5. The movements are not very large, but can be expressed as an induced-®t upon binding of maltotetraose. Absence of chloride ion binding A chloride ion binding was observed in some aamylases and predicted as conserved (Machius et al., 1995). However, despite our using Tris-HCl buffer in the crystallization process, a water molecule (Wat549) with a reasonable temperature facÊ tor of 25 A2 for a bound water was found on the site of the reported chloride ion binding (Qian et al., 1993; Larson et al., 1994; Kadziola et al., 1994) in the type 2 complexed and wild-type enzyme, being hydrogen-bonded with Arg191NH2, Gln219OE1, and Asn292OD1. On the other hand, no bound atom was found at this site in the type 1 complexed and E219Q uncomplexed crystals. We thus conclude that chloride ion binding at this site is not essential. This site is located near the surface of the active cleft just behind Asn292 and Glu219. In the present structure analyses, as described above, the side-chain of Glu219 (or Gln219) seems to be ¯exible (Figure 5) and the site in question is not necessarily in a conserved rigid conformation. Roles of catalytic residues The deformation of the cleaved reducing end of maltotetraose (Glc4) strongly suggests the existence of distorted near-coplanar sugar conformation in the transition state of the catalytic pathway of a-amylases. It could not be concluded from the present study whether the true intermediate is an oxocarbonium-ion or forms a covalent adduct with a nearby amino acid. The C1-atom of Glc4 lies

unusually close to the Asp193OD1 with a distance Ê of 2.6 A, being still far for making a covalent bond, in both types of complex crystals. The side-chain of Asp193 is hydrogen-bonded or salt-bridged with the imino-group of the side-chain of Arg191 with the distances between NH1 of arginine and OD1 of Ê aspartic acid ranging from 2.7 to 2.9 A in the wildtype and complexed structures. Thus Asp193 is considered to be in an ionized form, making it a suitable candidate for the catalytic nucleophile. The importance of this well-conserved arginine residue (Svensson, 1994) has been shown in the mutagenesis of B. stearothermophilus a-amylase (Vihinen et al., 1990). A probable interpretation for the roles of these catalytic candidates as deduced from the present studies is as follows. Glu219 is working for the protonation to the glucosidic oxygen (general acid) as generally accepted (Strokopytov et al., 1995; Matsuura et al., 1984), Asp193 is working to stabilize the reaction intermediate by neutralizing the oxocabonium ion or by forming a covalent bond to the C1-atom of the cleaved end glucose, and Asp294 is working with considerable contribution for binding the substrate in a manner indispensable for catalytic activity. A similar possible mechanism has been proposed for lysozymes (Strynadka & James, 1991; Kuroki et al., 1993), however in the lysozyme, the third carboxylic amino acid is not proposed as a catalytic candidate. The role of the three catalytic residues in aamylases could be further clari®ed by investigating the structures of other kinds of mutant enzymes complexed with substrate.

The enzyme was subjected to cocrystallization with maltopentaose (Hayashibara Biochem. Lab., Inc.). Crystallization was performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 C in a 1:1 mixture of 2% (w/v) protein (E219Q mutant) solution buffered with 20 mM Tris-HCl

The crystals grew to a typical size of 0.8 mm Â 0.8 mm Â 0.5 mm within a week. In most cases, two differently shaped crystal types were formed simultaneously in one crystallization drop. Precession photographs of these crystals revealed that one type was almost isomorphous with the uncomplexed wild-type enzyme crystal (Morishita et al., 1997), and the other was different.

Data collection and processing Intensity data for the uncomplexed and the two types of complexed crystals were collected on a Rigaku imaging-plate diffractometer RAXIS-IIC. The X-ray beam was collimated with a mirror-mirror optical device and Ni-®ltered CuKa radiation from a 0.3 mm Â 0.3 mm focus on a rotating anode X-ray generator operated at 40 kV and 100 mA. A summary of the data collection is shown in Table 5. Structure determination and refinement The structure of the type 1 crystal was determined by the molecular replacement method using the program AUTOMR (Matsuura, 1991) with the wild-type structure (Morishita et al., 1997) as the search model. The orientational and translational parameters were determined unambiguously with the resolution ranges of calculation, Ê Ê 10 to 5 A and 10 to 8 A for the rotation and translation functions, respectively. This model gave an R-factor of Ê 0.31 after rigid-body re®nement at 10 to 2.5 A resolution. The structure of the type 2 crystal is almost isomorphous with the wild-type crystal, and the rigid-body re®nement was directly applied to the structure model of wild-type, giving an R-factor of 0.29 at the resolution range of 10 to Ê 2.5 A. The re®nements of both crystal types were begun using the models obtained in the above manner, initially Ê È with the program XPLOR (Brunger et al., 1987) at 2.5 A

Product Complexed Maltotetraose-forming -Amylase resolution, and then with the program PROFFT Ê (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980; Finzel, 1987) at 1.9 A resolution. The manual model corrections were done by the program FRODO (Jones, 1978) running on an Evans & Sutherland PS390 graphics system. As described before, since we found a deformed conformation in the reducing end glucose unit of the bound maltotetraose, special care was paid to de®ning the structure of this part. The re®nement converged to a distorted structure, and the structure was carefully checked by manual inspection of the graphics so as to better ®t the model to the electron densities. A difference electron density map of the bound maltotetraose is shown in Figure 6, which was calculated with the structure factors by omitting the maltotetraose. The same map with phases obtained from the re®nement with excluded maltotetraose was almost identical with that of Figure 6, leading also to the deformed glucose moiety as shown in Figure 4. The bound Ê water molecules were searched against 1.9 A resolution maps calculated with the coef®cients of Fo À Fc. Their positions were checked for suitable hydrogen bond geometry and corrected on the graphics display system against the maps calculated with both 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc as coef®cients. For type 1 and 2 crystals, the re®ned ®nal models gave R-factors of 0.174 for 27,563 re¯ections, and 0.191 for 35,190 re¯ections, respectively, with F > 2s(F) in the Ê range of 10 to 1.9 A resolution. The ®nal model of the type 1 crystal contained 3297 atoms of 419 amino acid residues (excluding the 11 residues that were disordered), two bound calcium ions, 44 atoms of maltotetraose, and 294 bound water molecules. The type 2 crystal contained 3297 atoms of the same region of residues as type 1, two bound calcium ions, 44 atoms of maltotetraose, and 227 bound water molecules. The Luzzati-plot (Luzzati, 1952) (data not shown) gave an estimated mean error in atomÊ ic positions of about 0.18 A for both types of complex crystals. The re®nement of uncomplexed E219Q mutant Ê enzyme was similarly carried out at 2.2 A resolution, resulting in an R-factor of 0.174, with an estimated posÊ itional error of 0.20 A from the Luzzati-plot. The re®nement statistics are summarized in Table 6. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, New York, USA. (Bernstein et al., 1977) under the ®le names of 1JDA (uncomplexed E219Q), 1JDC (complexed type 1), and 1JDD (complexed type 2 crystals).
