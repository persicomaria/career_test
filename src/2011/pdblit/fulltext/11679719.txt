Vipoxin is a neurotoxic postsynaptic heterodimeric complex from the venom of Vipera ammodytes meridionalis, the most toxic snake in Europe. It consists of a basic and highly toxic phospholipase A2 and an acidic non-toxic protein inhibitor. The two polypeptide chains have the same chain length and share 62% amino-acid identity. Vipoxin is a unique example of evolution of the catalytic and toxic phospholipase A2 functions into inhibitory and non-toxic functions. The crystal structure of the complex has been determined by the Ê molecular-replacement method and re®ned to 1.4 A resolution to an R factor of 18.2%. The complex formation decreases Ê the accessible surface area of the two subunits by $1480 A2, which results in a reduction of toxicity and catalytic activity. The catalytic and substrate-binding sites of the vipoxin phospholipase A2 are identical or similar to those of other group I/II enzymes. Two 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol molecules are present in the hydrophobic channel close to the active site. The two subunits lack calcium ions. The negatively charged Asp49 of the phospholipase A2, which participates in the Ca2+binding sites of other snake-venom phospholipase A2s, is neutralized by the side chain of Lys69 from the inhibitor. Attempts have been made to identify the toxicity region and to explain the reduced catalytic activity and toxicity of the phospholipase A2 subunit.

1. Introduction
The neurotoxin vipoxin is the main lethal component of the venom of V. ammodytes meridionalis, the most toxic snake in Europe. It is a complex between a basic strongly toxic phospholipase A2 (PLA2; phosphatide 2-acylhydrolase; E.C. 3.1.1.4) and an acidic, non-toxic and catalytically inactive protein inhibitor (Inh). The venoms of other snakes inhabiting southeast Europe, V. ammodytes ammodytes and V. ammodytes montandoni, which are evolutionarily older, contain monomeric PLA2s. The two components of vipoxin are highly homologous proteins with 62% sequence identity (Mancheva et al., 1987). This is the ®rst known example of such a high degree of structural homology between an enzyme and its natural protein inhibitor. Vipoxin PLA2 is a group II A enzyme containing 122 amino-acid residues and seven disul®de bridges. It is a very unstable protein and loses its toxicity and catalytic activity irreversibly in a few days after separation from the complex even when stored at 273 K in a lyophilized form. In contrast, the neurotoxic complex is stable for more than 4 y (Aleksiev & Tchorbanov, 1976). Most probably, Inh evolved from PLA2 and when associated with the enzyme reduces both the catalytic activity and toxicity. In this respect, vipoxin is the ®rst reported example of transformation of enzymatic and toxic functions into inhibitory and

non-toxic functions. The neurotoxic complex also demonstrates a modulation of the toxic phospholipase function generated by molecular evolution. Comparison with other multichain neurotoxins showed that vipoxin is unique in many properties and differs from them in several pharmacological functions. The oligomeric toxins containing an active PLA2 component are usually -neurotoxins which bind to the neuronal presynaptic plasma membranes and affect neurotransmitter release (Bon, 1997). Vipoxin is an exception to this rule and is one of the few known multichain neurotoxins with postsynaptic toxicity (Tchorbanov et al., 1978). It is an -neurotoxin which acts on the postsynaptic membranes, preventing the binding of acetylcholine to its receptor and blocking the neuromuscular transmission of skeletal muscles. In this way the toxin exerts its lethal action. Another postsynaptic multimeric snake-venom toxin is -bungarotoxin from the venom of Bungarus multicinctus (Gubensek et al., 1997). -Bungarotoxin is a presynaptic neurotoxin which acts on the presynaptic site or nerve site of the neuromuscular junctions (Bon, 1997). In contrast to the vipoxin PLA2 and Inh, which are associated through non-covalent interactions, in -bungarotoxin the PLA2 subunit is covalently linked by a disul®de bridge to the second component of the neurotoxic complex, the so-called `Kunitz' subunit (Bon, 1997). The presynaptic oligomeric crotoxin also differs from vipoxin in structure and pharmacological properties. Thus, the nonenzymatic component of vipoxin is monomeric, while the respective component of the crotoxin complex consists of three polypeptide chains (Breithaupt et al., 1974). When isolated from the complex, the vipoxin PLA2 manifests a presynaptic action (Tchorbanov et al., 1978). Evidently, the

complex formation changes the target of the pharmacological action of the neurotoxin and vipoxin is `targeted' to the postsynaptic site. The additional units in the PLA2 multimeric complexes act like chaperones and help in speci®c binding of the enzyme to the target. Usually, they enhance the lethal potency of the PLA2 subunit, as has been observed in the cases of neurotoxic complexes from V. russelli formosensis (Wang et al., 1992), V. aspis zinnikeri (Komori et al., 1996) and Crotalus durissus È (Rubsamen et al., 1971). However, in vipoxin Inh considerably reduces the lethal action of the PLA2 component: a ®vefold increase of the vipoxin PLA2 toxicity was observed after separation from the inhibitor (Aleksiev & Tchorbanov, 1976). Recently, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction studies on the toxin from V. russelli formosensis have been published (Rajashankar, Tsai et al., 1999). Here, we report the structure of the neurotoxic complex Ê vipoxin re®ned to 1.4 A resolution. A preliminary report on Ê vipoxin structure in a different crystal form to 2.0 A resolution has been previously reported (Perbandt et al., 1997). To the best of our knowledge, this is the only known structure of a postsynaptic heterodimeric snake-venom neurotoxin whose PLA2 subunit is a group II enzyme. Also, this is the ®rst structure of a complex between a higly homologous enzyme and a natural protein inhibitor which has evolved from the enzyme and acquired an inhibitory function.

2. Materials and methods
Crude venom was obtained from the toxic gland of V. ammodites meridionalis. Homogeneous vipoxin was isolated by ion-exchange chromatography as described by Tchorbanov & Aleksiev (1981). A new stable crystal form of vipoxin suitable for high-resolution X-ray intensity data collection was obtained after extensive screening. The crystals grew within two weeks by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion technique from a solution with a protein concentration of 10 mg mlÀ1 containing 5%(v/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG 4000) and 18%(v/v) 2-methyl-2-4-pentanediol (MPD) as precipitant at 287 K. Preliminary data on crystallization and Ê structure analysis to 2.0 A, based on a different crystal form, have been published previously (Rajashankar, Genov et al., 1999; Perbandt et al., 1997). New diffraction data were collected at 100 K with synchrotron radiation at DESY Hamburg on a ¯ash-frozen crystal with approximate dimensions of 0.3 Â 0.3 Â 0.2 mm on the synchrotron beamline BW7B using a MAR image-plate scanner. The images were processed using the DENZO program package (Otwinowski & Minor, 1996). The initial phase problem was solved by molecular-replacement techniques applying the program Ê AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) using the 2.0 A model of vipoxin. The re®nement was performed by molecular-dynamic techniques using the program CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). The CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) and the program TURBO-FRODO (Roussel & Cambillau, 1991) were used for calculations and model building, respectively. The solvent molecules were added

subsequently during re®nement at chemically reasonable positions where (Fo À Fc) difference density exceeded 3'. Ca2+ could not be identi®ed, but two MPD molecules were clearly located in the hydrophobic channel. The ®nal model of vipoxin contains 1911 non-H protein atoms, 320 water molecules and two MPD molecules. The occupancy for the atom C5 of one MPD molecule was de®ned to be 0.0, since the density at this region did not appear clearly. The crystallographic R and Rfree factors were 18.2 and 19.5%, respectively, for the Ê resolution range 20±1.4 A. The ®nal model has been analysed using the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), which indicates that 90.7% of all residues fall into the most favoured region of the 9,2 plane. The average isotropic B Ê factor for all atoms of vipoxin is 16 A2. The electron density of all atoms of the model is well de®ned except for residues Lys86, Asn89 and Lys115 of the PLA2, which are at the surface of the molecule. For these residues, electron densities are only visible up to the C atoms. Weak densities were also observed for residues Arg35 and Lys115 of the Inh, which are also at the surface of the molecule. The ®nal stereochemical parameters and a summary of data-collection and re®nement parameters are summarized in Table 1. The surface accessibility was calculated using the program DSSP (Kabsch & Sander, 1983).

The vipoxin heterodimer is composed of two subunits with essentially identical folding. The whole complex has a close to globular shape and has dimensions of Ê 30 Â 55 Â 32 A. Each monomer has dimensions of approximately 12 Â 40 Â Ê 25 A. The overall structures of the subunits are similar to those of other snake-venom PLA2s, as shown in Fig. 1. The secondary structure consists of three helices, two short helical segments and one section of antiparallel -sheet. Two long and antiparallel -helices include residues 40±54 and 89±109,

It includes residues 74±85 and extends outwards from the protein globule. This speci®c substructure is the only segment of -sheet structure; it includes 15% of the residues and is de®ned as a `-wing'. It is conserved in group I/II/III PLA2s (Scott, 1997). The `-wing' structure is more ¯exible and only partially stabilized by interaction with side chains of helix V. The tertiary structure is further stabilized by seven disul®de bridges, as shown in Fig. 1, which are typical of the group II secretory PLA2s.

respectively. They are connected with two disul®de bridges stabilizing this substructure. The third -helix includes the N-terminal part of the polypeptide chain (residues 2±14). Leu2, Phe5, Met8 and Ile9 from this helix, which are conserved in both PLA2 and Inh, participate in the formation of a hydrophobic channel leading to the catalytic site. During catalysis, the channel is occupied by the substrate. Approximately 50% of the residues of PLA2 and Inh are included in -helix structures. A loop of double-stranded antiparallel -sheet is observed in the two components of the heterodimer.

The catalytic residues of the vipoxin PLA2 are shown with the superimposed electron density in Fig. 2. They include His48, Asp99 and a water molecule (OW82) which serves as a nucleophile during the catalysis. The X-ray model revealed the presence of the so-called `catalytic network', a system of hydrogen bonds which involves the catalytic triad and additional two tyrosines, Tyr52 and Tyr73. Furthermore, the saltbridge interaction between the PLA2 and Inh subunit via Asp49 and Lys69 (Fig. 2) is particularly interesting. This speci®c hydrogen-bonding network stabilizes the region of the catalytic site and the conformation of the whole molecule. The arrangement of this site is, in principle, similar to that of other PLA2s. It occupies a hydrophobic cavity which is opened toward the protein surface and connected with a hydrophobic channel. The hydrophobicity of this region is supported by the presence of two MPD (2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol) molecules. This con®rms that monodisperse hydrophobic molecules can enter the vicinity of the hydrophobic channel. As displayed in Fig. 2, one MPD molecule participates in several interactions with active-site residues (Table 2a). MPD was used in the crystallization buffer and it is therefore striking to ®nd it in the position that would be occupied by the free fatty acid liberated after the hydrolysis of phospholipids (Van Deeman & Haas, 1963). Snake-venom PLA2s bind the acyl portion of substrates to such channels (Scott, 1997). This substructure was identi®ed in both the vipoxin PLA2 and Inh, and consists of Leu2, Phe5, Met8, Ile9, Tyr22, Cys29, Cys45, Ala102, Ala103 and Phe106 (Leu106 in Inh). The hydrophobic channel of the inhibitor can not function productively because the non-toxic subunit lacks enzymatic activity. Vipoxin was crystallized in the absence of added calcium and for this reason the two subunits lack metal ions. In the secretory PLA2s, the Ca2+-binding loop includes residues 25±33. The metal ion is coordinated by O atoms of Asp49 (two carboxylate O atoms) and the carbonyl O atoms of Tyr28, Gly30 and Gly32 as well as two water molecules. This loop forms one of the walls of the hydrophobic channel and for this reason is important for the enzyme±substrate interactions. Calcium stabilizes the substructure mentioned above; in the absence of metal ion the loop is conformationally ¯exible. In vipoxin, the carbonyl O atoms of residues 28 and 32 from the PLA2 subunit are involved in intermolecular contacts with the inhibitor (Table 2b) and the O atom of the CO group Ê of residue 32 is 5.5 A away from the potential calcium-binding site. However, the negative charge of the PLA2 Asp49 is

physiological as well as structural functions. The toxic PLA2 preserves its pharmacological activity for a long time owing to the complex formation with the non-toxic component. Inh is catalytically inactive owing to the substitution of the active site His48 with Gln48 (Fig. 3). Inh stabilizes the unstable PLA2 through ionic and hydrophobic interactions and in this way the toxic subunit of the complex preserves the catalytically and physiologically active conformation. All direct interactions are summarized in Table 2(b). Furthermore, 13 solvent water molecules are buried inside the PLA2±Inh interface and provide an intensive hydrogen-bonding network, as summarized in Table 2(c), which further enhances the stabilization of the vipoxin complex. We have shown that the complex formation between PLA2 and Inh increases the free energy of stabilization in water of vipoxin by 6±10 kJ molÀ1 in comparison to that of the components (Genov et al., 1998). The nontoxic inhibitor is an acidic protein with a pI of 4.6, while the strongly toxic PLA2 is a basic subunit with a pI of 10.4 (Tchorbanov et al., 1978). The drastic change in the charge (see also Table 3) may be responsible, at least in part, for the lack of toxicity. The predominant negative charge of Inh should create a repulsion of its molecule from the anionic

Inh is a multifunctional subunit of the vipoxin complex and it appears that it evolved from the closely related PLA2 by divergent evolution. The high degree of sequence homology (62%), the identical length of the polypeptide chains (122 residues) and the high three-dimensional structure similarity con®rm this hypothesis. In the neurotoxic complex, Inh plays

membrane surface. Inh covers part of the enzyme±substrate binding site and this may explain the inhibitory effect of the non-toxic subunit. The entrance to the active site of PLA2 is partially shielded by Inh and this makes the hydrolysis of substrate molecules dif®cult. However, the complex formation does not drastically disturb the access of small substrates to the PLA2 active site as shown by the presence of MPD molecules: vipoxin is enzymatically active, although the activity is reduced. Vipoxin binds speci®cally to postsynaptic membranes, which means selective interaction with the target receptor. However, the PLA2 separated from the complex shows presynaptic activity. Therefore, the binding of Inh to the enzyme seems to change the target of the physiological attack from the pre- to postsynaptic site of neuromuscular junctions. Consequently, it can be assumed that Inh is involved in the speci®c binding of the neurotoxin to the membrane as a `chaperone' directing the PLA2 subunit to its acceptor and preventing non-speci®c binding or participating in a transient complex Inh±PLA2±acceptor. Such a synergism between enzymatic and non-enzymatic subunits has been described for crotoxin (Bon, 1997). The inhibitory and neurotoxic components of vipoxin are highly homologous closely related proteins with very similar three-dimensional structures. One of them is a strongly toxic protein, while the other is completely devoid of toxicity. Comparison of the regions supposed to be responsible for the toxicity, mainly the -wing and the segment including residues 115±128 (Wang et al., 1992), showed drastic changes in the electrostatic charge, which can be seen in Fig. 4. The -wing of PLA2 contains positively charged residues, while the same loop of double-stranded antiparallel -sheet in Inh is negatively charged. Also, the segment between residues 115±128 has a positive charge in PLA2 and a negative charge in Inh. Most probably, the electrostatic charge is important for the presence or absence of toxicity in PLA2 and Inh, respectively.
3.4. Comparison of PLA2 and inhibitor

The C positions of the two polypeptide chains of PLA2 and Ê Inh were superimposed with an r.m.s. difference of 1.5 A and a Ê maximum displacement of 5.4 A. Larger differences between the two monomers were observed in the ¯exible surface region including residues 16±20 between helix I and helix II at the N-terminus, residues 79±81 (the -turn of the -wing) and the

C-terminal region 121±124, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6. Fig. 6 also shows the superposition of the C chain of the homologous PLA2 from C. atrox (PDB entry 1pp2; Keith et al., Ê 1981), which resulted in an r.m.s. value of 1.6 A and a maximal Ê . The vipoxin PLA2 was ®nally superdisplacement of 4.7 A imposed on the PLA2 of Agkistrodron halys pallas (PDB entry 1a2a; Tang et al., 1998), with a corresponding r.m.s. value of Ê Ê 1.6 A and a maximum displacement of 5.4 A. All three neurotoxins belong to the group II PLA2s and are closely related proteins with sequence homologies in the range 50± 60% (Fig. 3). They all consist of 122 amino acids, have a dimer conformation and are structurally stabilized by seven salt bridges. The distribution of functionally important charged and aromatic residues is remarkably different (Table 3). Structural differences are found mainly in the C terminus and in the region of the -wing, indicating the functional ¯exibility of this region. Finally, the C chain of vipoxin was superÊ imposed on the 2.0 A resolution structure (Perbandt et al., Ê 1997), resulting in an r.m.s. value of 0.8 A and a maximum Ê displacement of 4.4 A. The vipoxin X-ray model was inspected in order to ®nd the structural basis of the recognition speci®city of Inh for PLA2. The complex is stabilized by hydrophobic, ionic and hydrogenbond interactions. The intermolecular interactions stabilizing the neurotoxin are summarized in Table 2(b) and 2(c). The backbone carbonyl O atoms of Tyr28, Gly32, Val55 and Gly59 of PLA2 are bonded to Lys69 N, Leu2 N and Asn56 N2 from the inhibitor, respectively. Backbone carbonyl O atoms from the inhibitor are also bonded to side-chain atoms of the toxic subunit polypeptide chain. The complex is also stabilized by a salt bridge between the carboxylic O atoms of Asp49 from PLA2 and Lys69 N of Inh. The interface between the two subunits can be considered as a `recognition surface' for the speci®c binding of Inh to PLA2. This interface includes two tryptophyl residues from the toxic subunit, Trp20 and Trp31, and one tryptophan, Trp31, from the non-toxic component of the complex. Hydrophobic interactions in which the bulky side chains of tryptophans are involved play an important role for the stabilization of protein complexes as well as in the interfacial binding (Sumandea et al., 1999). The loss of accessible Ê surface area upon the complex formation is 1480 A2. This represents 13% of the whole accessible surface area of vipoxin (Table 3). In addition to hydrophobic forces, electrostatic interactions between the two oppositely charged subunits, basic PLA2 and acidic Inh, are important for the formation of the enzyme±inhibitor complex.

PLA2 is an enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids at the lipid±water interface. The interfacial adsorption surface of snake-venom PLA2s is located at the N-terminus of the polypeptide chain and includes residues surrounding the external opening of the hydrophobic channel: 1±3, 6±7,

It was shown that in addition to hydrophobic interactions, charged residues play an important role in optimizing interfacial catalysis (Han et al., 1997). It appears that positively charged residues facilitate the penetratability of PLA2; i.e. the insertion of the enzyme into the phospholipid membrane, which is important for the further hydrolysis of the membrane's phospholipids. There are four positively charged residues in the region of the interfacial recognition site of the vipoxin PLA2, Lys7, Lys69, Lys118 and Arg125, which can play important role in the binding and orientation of the toxin at the membrane lipid±water interface. At the same time, there are no negatively charged residues in this site; i.e. the net electrostatic charge of the recognition surface is positive. On the contrary, there are three negatively charged residues in the same region of the non-toxic polypeptide chain and only one positively charged functional group. This means that the net electrostatic charge of the respective surface of Inh is negative, which should create electrostatic repulsion from anionic interfaces and correlates with the lack of toxicity of this subunit. Some of the substitutions in the recognition site of Inh, K7D, F17E, K118E and R125H, are radical and lead to a drastic change in the electrostatic charge of the region important for the formation of the complex with a membrane.

The high-resolution crystal structure of the neurotoxin vipoxin provides detailed information about the nature of the forces crucial for the binding of the non-toxic protein inhibitor to the toxic and enzymatically active subunit. The complex formation is absolutely necessary for the preservation of the catalytic and pharmacological activities of the unstable PLA2. Other important result of the binding of Inh to PLA2 is the change in the target of physiological attack: the complex exhibits postsynaptic neurotoxicity, while the isolated enzyme is a presynaptic toxin. The high af®nity of Inh for PLA2 is a consequence of speci®c hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between the `recognition site' of the inhibitory subunit and the respective binding surface of the toxic polypeptide chain. Vipoxin is a unique example of modulation of the catalytic and toxic functions of a snake-venom PLA2 generated by divergent evolution. In this respect, the threedimensional model of the neurotoxin is of pharmacological interest and has provided new insights for structure-based drug-design studies.

These investigations were also supported by a grant from DAAD (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, Germany) and by a grant from the Department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi in terms of the Project Based Personnel Exchange.

The neurotoxic site(s) of PLA2 ensures the binding of the neurotoxin to the target neuromembrane and the realisation of the pharmacological activity. These sites are separated from the catalytic site (Kini, 1997). However, some progress in the location of neurotoxic sites on the toxin molecule and in understanding the mechanism of their interactions with the respective receptors has been made (Krizaj et al., 1989). The pharmacological effects of PLA2 were investigated by in vitro methods and using isolated tissues, which sometimes led to non-speci®c effects. Nevertheless, successful experiments allowing the localization of the parts of the PLA2 surface responsible for the toxicity have been reported. Thus, immunological investigations of the neurotoxin ammodytoxin A from V. ammodytes ammodytes revealed two sites of toxicity located in the C-terminal half of the molecule between residues 106±113 and 113±121 (Gubensek et al., 1997). Residues 6, 12, 76±81 (-wing) and 119±125 from the toxic component RV4 of the V. russelli formosensis dimeric toxin were identi®ed as important for the toxicity (Wang et al., 1992). The components of this neurotoxin show 92% sequence identity to the respective subunits of vipoxin and a high degree of homology was observed in the regions identi®ed as sites of toxicity in RV4. The model of vipoxin shows that these regions are located on the protein surface and can interact with acceptors. Inh partially blocks the segment 119±125 of the toxic subunit. This can explain, at least in part, the reduced toxicity of PLA2 when it is complexed with Inh. The region including the -wing structure is largely exposed to the solvent and can interact with the respective membrane receptor.
