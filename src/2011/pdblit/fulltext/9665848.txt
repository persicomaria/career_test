Escherichia coli pyridoxine 5H -phosphate oxidase catalyzes the terminal step in the biosynthesis of pyridoxal 5H -phosphate by the FMN oxidation of pyridoxine 5H -phosphate forming FMNH2 and H2O2. Recent studies have shown that in addition to the active site, pyridoxine 5H -phosphate oxidase contains a non-catalytic site that binds pyridoxal 5H -phosphate tightly. The crystal structure of pyridoxine 5H -phosphate oxidase from E. coli with one or two molecules of pyridoxal 5H -phosphate bound to Ê each monomer has been determined to 2.0 A resolution. One of the pyridoxal 5H -phosphate molecules is clearly bound at the active site with the aldehyde at C4H of pyridoxal 5H -phosphate near N5 of the bound FMN. A protein conformational change has occurred that partially closes the active site. The orientation of the bound pyridoxal 5H -phosphate suggests that the enzyme catalyzes a hydride ion transfer between C4H of pyridoxal 5H -phosphate and N5 of FMN. When the crystals are soaked with excess pyridoxal 5H -phosphate an additional molecule of this cofactor is Ê also bound about 11 A from the active site. A possible tunnel exists between the two sites so that pyridoxal 5H -phosphate formed at the active site may transfer to the non-catalytic site without passing though the solvent.

Introduction
One of the most important aspects of current cell biology is to determine how reactive and unstable metabolic intermediates survive in the cell. One proposal is that these reactive and unstable molecules are transferred from the enzyme that produces them to the next enzyme in the metabolic pathway by direct transfer called channeling.1 Channeling avoids releasing such molecules to be free in the cell cytoplasm. Pyridoxal 5H -phosphate (PLP) contains a very reactive aldehyde group that reacts with virtually all nucleophiles in the cell, suggesting it might be a candidate for metabolic channeling. PLP forms aldimines with primary or secondary amines and

is often used as a protein labeling agent because of its reactivity with the e-amino group of lysyl residues in proteins. The aldehyde group also forms a stable ®ve-membered thiazolidine ring with cysteine. In its function in the cell, as a cofactor for many enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism, PLP is bound as an internal aldimine to an e-amino group of a lysyl residue at the active site.2 This is protected from most nucleophiles in the cell so that only the substrate amino group can form the active site complex as an external aldimine. This suggests that during the biosynthesis of PLP in Escherichia coli the reactive aldehyde group must be protected from forming non-productive complexes with other nucleophiles and proteins so that it can be targeted directly to those apo-enzymes which require it for activity. It was for this reason that we started a study of pyridoxine 5H -phosphate oxidase (PNPOx) as the terminal step in PLP biosynthesis to determine its properties and a possible mechanism for how PLP is protected in the cell

818 from adventitious reactions with non-productive nucleophiles. PNPOx, a kinetically sluggish but moderately abundant enzyme in E. coli, contains a binding site for PLP that is not the catalytic site.3,4 PLP dissociates very slowly from this site, since repeated chromatography on size exclusion columns does not separate PNPOx from PLP. However, we also showed that this slowly dissociating PLP could be readily transferred to the PLP requiring aposerine hydroxymethyltransferase to form the active holoenzyme. The purpose of this study is to (1) determine how PLP is bound at the active site of PNPOx as an aid in the elucidation of the mechanism of oxidation of pyridoxine 5H -phosphate (PNP) to PLP, and (2) to determine the location of the non-catalytic PLP binding site. Structures of E. coli PNPOx with bound PLP were compared to our previously obtained structure of this enzyme without bound ligands.5

Results
Substrate and product binding to PNPOx in crystals Native crystals were soaked in 20 mM PLP resulting in one PLP molecule bound at the active site. This complex is referred to as PNPOx-1PLP. Because binding studies had previously shown that PLP binds to both a catalytic and a non-catalytic site on PNPOx, we soaked the native crystal in a higher concentration of PLP (40 mM). The electron density map of these crystals shows two PLP molecules bound to the protein: one at the active site, similar to that of PNPOx-1PLP, and a new non-catalytic site located at the surface of the protein. The non-catalytic PLP molecule is disordered in two positions, with an occupancy ratio of about 0.7 and 0.3, respectively. This complex is referred to as PNPOx-2PLPH . When the native crystal is soaked in 20 mM PLP for an extended period of time (longer than ten days), the resulting complex also shows two PLP molecules bound to the enzyme (referred to as PNPOx-2PLP) with the second PLP only in the higher occupancy orientation at the non-catalytic site. We also soaked crystals with the substrate PNP (20 mM, for ten days) for comparison with the PLP complexes. A single molecule of PLP (or possibly a mixture of PLP and PNP) was observed at the active site. This structure is referred to as PNPOx-PNP. Crystal structures of the complexes Crystals of E. coli PNPOx, complexed with either PLP, or possibly PNP, were obtained under similar conditions as the previously obtained native crysÊ tals, for which a structure was determined to 1.8 A resolution.5 As expected, all PNPOx complexes yielded crystals that are isomorphous to that of the native PNPOx crystal. The crystals belong to the

space group P3121 and have a monomer in their asymmetric unit. All structures were re®ned with the program CNS starting with the native structure model, omitting the FMN, a bound phosphate ion, and water molecules. The PNPOx-2PLPH and PNPOx-1PLP structures were re®ned to 2.0 and Ê 2.1 A resolution, respectively, while PNPOx-2PLP Ê and PNPOx-PNP structures were re®ned to 2.2 A resolution. The crystallographic data are summarized in Table 1, and details of structure re®nement are described in Materials and Methods. The ®nal models for all complex structures consist of one FMN cofactor, two phosphate ions, and 199 amino acids (the ®rst 19 residues are missing from each structure) and are similar to the previously described native structure.5 In addition, all the complexes have either a well de®ned PNP or PLP molecule bound at the active site close to the cofactor FMN. The complexes with PLP bound at a non-catalytic site show the PLP with the higher occupancy to be well de®ned, while that of lower occupancy has broken electron density between the pyridine and phosphate moieties. Shown in Figure 1(a), (b) and (c) are the 2Fo À Fc electron density maps calculated around the active site for PNPOx-PNP and PNPOx-2PLPH and the noncatalytic site for PNPOx-2PLPH , respectively. The secondary structure assignment and overall topology of the complexes are identical to the native structure.5 Two monomers, related by a 2-fold axis, interact extensively along one-half of each monomer to form the functional dimer. Each subunit consists of two domains folded into an eight-stranded b-sheet surrounded by ®ve a-helical structures. The catalytic site is located at the dimer interface, while the newly observed non-catalytic PLP site is mainly formed by one subunit. Figure 2 shows the dimeric structure of PNPOx-2PLPH , generated by applying the 2-fold symmetry element to the asymmetric monomer. The tightly bound FMN is shown in red and the PLP molecules at the active site and the two orientations at the non-catalytic site are shown in yellow. Binding of PLP to the active site Our earlier analysis of the possible catalytic mechanism suggested a putative binding site for the substrate PNP at the re-face of N5 of the bound FMN cofactor. All four structures reported here show PLP to have similar binding modes and indeed to bind at the active site much as proposed.5 However, in the previous model the pyridine ring is rotated 180  from what is observed in this study with all four complexes. PLP is situated at the re-face of N5 of FMN with the phosphate group pointing out of the cavity mouth, in contrast to the FMN phosphate moiety that points downward into the cavity bottom. Like our previous hypothetically bound PNP, the phosphate moiety of PLP is oriented towards the N terminus of helix H4, which provides a stabilizing positive electrostatic ®eld. Speci®c interactions

involving PLP and the protein for all complexes are given in Table 2. The binding characteristics of the PLP are similar in all three PLP-bound complexes, with replication of almost all the active site ordered water molecules. After superposition of protein residues (minus 23 residues that have high deviation Ê >1.0 A), the rmsd value of the non-superimposed bound PLP molecules in all three complexes is Ê $0.25 A. In all three PLP-bound complexes there is a large conformational change at the C terminus of helix H3, helix H4, and the loop (loop A) located between these two helices (residues 129-140) when compared to native PNPOx without bound PLP (Figure 3). The above structures have, on an averÊ age, shifted 1.4 A and rotated 2.7  in a perpendicular direction toward the active site cavity compared to that of the native structure. This tertiary movement allows the residues Tyr129, Arg133 and Ser137 to come closer and make interactions with the PLP phosphate moiety. In the native structure, Arg133 was re®ned in two alternate conformations.5 One conformer was identi®ed as binding to the modeled PNP phosphate and this conformer corresponds to that

observed in the complex. The other conformer, as correctly predicted, can not occur with substrate or product present at the active site as it clashes with the position of the PLP phosphate. A yeast PNPOx structure (PDB entry number 1CI0) has only one conformer for the equivalent of Arg133 and it is similar to that observed in our E. coli PNPOx complexes with PLP. In the E. coli PNPOx structures, Tyr129 and Arg133 make direct hydrogen bond interactions with the phosphate moiety in all complexes, while Ser137 makes a direct hydrogen bond interaction only with the PLP phosphate of PNPOx-2PLP. In both PNPOx-2PLPH and PNPOx1PLP, Ser137 makes a water-mediated interaction with the PLP phosphate (Figure 4). Lys72, which also lies adjacent to Tyr129, makes a short hydrogen bond interaction with the PLP phosphate. Unlike Tyr129, Arg133 and Ser137, the position of Lys72 has not changed when compared to its position in the native structure. Tyr129 and Arg133 are totally conserved residues in the 15-member PNPOx family, while Lys72 and Ser137 are conserved in 14 of the 15 sequences.5 The interactions between the phosphate group and the four residues described above help anchor the PLP on the re-face of N5 of FMN. The PLP pyr-

idine ring is stacked almost parallel against the pyrazine and pyrimidine portions of the FMN isoalloxazine ring with extensive hydrogen bond and van der Waals contacts (Figure 4). In fact, most of the close hydrophobic contacts that are made by Ê PLP in the three complexes (<3.9 A) occur between the pyridine ring of the PLP and the isoalloxazine ring of the FMN. In our previous hypothetical model,5 our incorrect 180  orientation of the pyriÊ dine ring of PNP placed it about 4.5 A from the observed position where it mainly made hydro-

phobic contacts with the dimethylbenzene moiety of the FMN isoalloxazine ring. In front, and situated at the re-face of C4 of the PLP pyridine ring, are the invariant residues Arg197 and His199 from the second monomer. They make direct hydrogen bond interactions to the carbonyl oxygen on C4H and the O3H -hydroxyl group of PLP, respectively (Table 2 and Figure 4). Arg197 makes a further hydrogen bond interaction with the phosphate moiety. These two residues are found on the ¯exible turn located between the strands S6 and S7 (turn A, residues 193-199), Ê which has shifted and rotated about 2.4 A and 9.4  , with the residues Gln192 and Asp200 acting as hinges (Figure 3). The movement is both parallel and perpendicular towards the plane of the pyridine ring of PLP. The overall motion of turn A enables His199 and Arg197 to come closer to PLP for hydrogen bond interactions as described above. As pointed out previously, it is clear that the sidechain position of Arg197 in the native structure would sterically inhibit the binding of substrate or product.5 In the complexes, Arg197 has moved Ê about 2 A from its position in the native structure to occupy a new position and has become relatively well ordered. In the native structure the Arg197 side-chain was tenuous as it lacked a well de®ned side-chain. The two residues His199 and Arg197 thus act as a clamp on PLP sandwiching the pyridine moiety onto the isoalloxazine ring of FMN while catalysis takes place. Arg197 may be the critical Arg residue observed by Choi and McCormick6 in rabbit PNPOx. In addition to playing a central role in sequestering the substrate during catalysis, His199 may also contribute to the stabilization of the transition-state by its interaction with O3H of PNP. The carbonyl oxygen of the aldehyde in PNPOx1PLP and PNPOx-2PLPH appears to have two conformations that differ by 180  at the C4 ÐC4H bond. Only one conformer, with the carbonyl oxygen at C4H cis to O3H (Figure 1(b)), was re®ned in the complexes. Both conformers make interactions with Arg197, and an additional water-mediated interaction with Asp49. In PNPOx-2PLP, the alternate conformation of the oxygen is not obvious, even when the electron density map is contoured at a very low sigma level. The re-orientation of the helix H3-loop A-helix H4 motif and turn A after the binding of PLP has also brought the helix H4 and turn A closer together (Figure 3). In particular, the distance between Ca of His196 and Ca of Asp136 decreased Ê from about 9.0 A in the native structure to about Ê in the complexes, resulting in a hydrogen 6.0 A Ê bond contact of 3.4-3.8 A between these two residues in the PLP-bound complexes. Also, in the complexes, helix H3-loop A-helix H4 and turn A have become more ordered with lower B-factors compared to the native structure. The structural changes that result in the positioning of the protein side-chains around the PLP has led to a partial closure of the active site in the three complexes.

The two subunits are colored magenta and cyan, respectively. Denoted in the Figure are both the active and noncatalytic PLP binding sites. Elements in the Figure were drawn using MOLSCRIPT21 and Raster3D22 and labeled with SHOWCASE.

In all three complexes, there is a water-mediated interaction between the pyridine nitrogen and the NE of Trp178. This water molecule is not conserved. In the native structure, the side-chain of Trp178 is oriented almost 90  to that observed in the PLP-bound complexes, and this position precludes the binding of the water molecule. Crystals soaked with PNP When crystals are soaked with the substrate PNP in place of the product, PLP density appears in the active site that is similar but distinct to that observed with the PLP-bound complexes (Figure 1(b)). PNP differs from PLP by having an alcohol group and sp3 hybridization at C4H in place of the aldehyde group and sp2 hybridization. Since

the crystals contain O2 the PNP should have been converted to PLP, but it is possible that the local O2 concentration has been lowered and an equilibrium between PNP and PLP has been reached. Re®nement with both PNP and PLP ®tted to the density behaves equally well. Like the PNPOx2PLP structure, the C4H oxygen does not show an alternate conformation about the C4 Ð C4H bond, as observed in the other two PLP-bound complexes. Although it is not certain whether the bound ligand is 100 % PLP or a mixture of PLP and PNP, we will refer to this complex as PNPOx-PNP, indicating it was formed by a crystal soaked with the substrate PNP rather then with the product PLP. The re®ned PNPOx-PNP structure shows a looser active site cavity entrance, and a tertiary structure that is closer to the native PNPOx structure than

823 Lys145 makes a hydrogen bond interaction with the phosphate moiety. Lying adjacent to Phe177, and also guarding the putative tunnel, is Asn84, which makes a close hydrogen bond interaction with the pyridine N of PLP. There is a water-mediated interaction between the His91 side-chain and the phosphate moiety. The phosphate moiety also makes an interaction with the symmetry-related residues Arg25 and Asp26. Although these two symmetry-related residues confer some stability on conformer A, this conformer can easily be stabilized by the protein residues alone. In addition to the residues Asn84, Lys145 and Ph177, residues Ser144, Gly85 and Ala141 are also located at the non-catalytic end of the putative tunnel. All these residues, with the exception of Lys145, are highly conserved in the PNPOx family.5 The second conformer of PLP at the non-catalytic site (conformer B) has an occupancy of 30 % in PNPOx-2PLPH with both the pyridine and the phosphate moieties well de®ned in the electron density map (Figure 1(c)). However, the residues linking these two PLP moieties exhibit only weak electron density. The contacts between PLP and the protein involve a salt bridge with Lys159 and a side-to-face interaction with Phe177, as opposed to the face-to-face stacking interaction observed with the pyridine moiety of conformer A. This contact with Phe177 may be important because any conformational change that moves Phe177 towards the pyridine ring of conformer B would certainly help dislodge the PLP into the solvent. Lys159 is conserved in many of the members of the PNPOx family. Conformer B also makes two watermediated contacts with the symmetry-related residues Ala29 N and Asp26 OD1. The PNPOx-2PLP complex structure shows only conformer A, and it makes similar interactions to the protein as found in the PNPOx-2PLPH complex. We do believe that the non-catalytic site is real and not an artifact of crystal packing. Conformer A is clearly stabilized by the protein residues alone. It is not certain whether the second conformer can exist without the symmetry element contacts. Possible tunnel between PLP sites The putative tunnel between the two PLP sites is formed, with the exception of one residue, by one subunit and is made up of the following protein structures: the C-terminal region of strand S3 and turn B (residues 82-87); helix H4, loops A and B (residues 130-147); the N-terminal region of strand S6 and loop C (173-179); and the C terminus residue Pro218 of the second subunit (Figure 3). The tunnel is mainly composed of Gly and small sidechain residues that point away from the tunnel interior, with the exception of Asn84, Arg133, Phe177 and Trp178 that point inward. Arg133, Asn84 and Trp178 are totally conserved, while Phe177 is not conserved but is replaced by either

in almost all instances the bond distances between active site residues and the bound ligand are lengthened in the PNPOx-PNP structure compared to the PLP-bound structures. One other signi®cant difference is the relative position of turn A between the PNPOx-PNP structure and the PLP-bound complexes. In PNPOx-PNP turn A has shifted and Ê rotated 1.8 A and 8.5  , respectively, compared Ê with 2.4 A and 9.4  in the PLP-bound complexes. The hydrogen bond interaction between His196 Ê and Asp136 (3.4-3.8 A), observed in the PLPbound complexes, is abolished and lengthened to Ê 4.9 A. The result is a relatively smaller cavity mouth in the PLP-bound structures compared to the PNPOx-PNP structure, which is re¯ected in a higher B-factor of the helix H4-loop A-helix H3 motif and turn A of the PNPOx-PNP complex. In addition, the side-chain of Arg197 that is ordered in the PLP-bound complexes is disordered in the PNPOx-PNP complex. Lastly, in PNPOx-PNP the Trp178 side-chain occupies both the native and PLP-bound complex conformations, with the native conformer apparently at higher occupancy. Only one conformer, that of the native structure was re®ned. The bound PNP makes van der Waals contact to Trp178, instead of the water-mediated interaction observed in the PLP-bound complexes. Putative non-catalytic PLP binding site In vitro studies have shown that PNPOx binds a second molecule of PLP tightly at a non-catalytic site3. Even though this PLP remains bound during size exclusion chromatography it is readily transferred to apo serine hydroxymethyltransferase. The possible role of this non-catalytic site in channeling a sequestered PLP to other enzymes makes this an important area for further study. The crystal structure of PNPOx-2PLP and PNPOx-2PLPH show a second PLP bound in a cleft Ê at the protein surface, about 11 A from the active site bound PLP. The PNPOx-2PLPH structure shows that the PLP has two conformations which will be denoted as A and B. Conformer A, with occupancy of 70 %, lies in a cavity created by: the turn located between strand S3 and helix H2 (turn B; residues 84-87); the C-terminal region of helix H4 and part of the loop region (loop B) located between helices H4 and H5 (residues 141-145); and the C-terminal end of the loop region between helix H5 and strand S6 (loop C; residues 175-177) (Figure 3). The plane of the pyridine ring is sandwiched between the side-chains of Phe177 and Lys145, and is located close to what appears to be a tunnel that leads to the active site. One face of the pyridine ring makes a face-to-face stacking contact against Phe177, while Lys145, which is located on the other side of the pyridine ring, runs alongside the entire length of PLP, making numerous hydrophobic contacts with the pyridine ring and C5H (Figure 1(c)). In addition, the amino group of

824 Tyr or His in many of the currently known sequences.5 There are three water molecules that are located between the active site PLP and the non-catalytic PLP site in the PLP-bound complexes. Only one of the water molecules is conserved in the complexes and the native structures. The PNPOx-PNP complex has only two of the water molecules. The conserved water is located almost in the center of the tunnel and makes hydrogen bond interactions with the surrounding Asn84, Ser144, and Ala141 to effectively close the tunnel. The shortest diameter of the tunnel, as measured by the distance between Ca atoms of amino acid Ê residues, is about 8 A in each of the complexes and the native structures. However, the presence of side-chains of Trp178, Phe177, Arg133 and Asn84 in the cavity narrows the tunnel, especially at the non-catalytic site. Comparison of the productbound complex structures with the native structure shows that the side-chain of Trp178 has rotated Ê almost 90  to swing as much as 0.5 A from the tunnel interior. The rotation has also resulted in Ê the side-chain of Trp178 to move about 1 A further away from the bound PLP. Although the current structures show the channel to be small for passage of PLP, the channel could easily open up, since most of the protein structure surrounding the channel is ¯exible, including the whole of domain 2 (Figure 3) that occupies about half of the tunnel site.

Discussion
PNPOx catalyzes the terminal step in PLP biosynthesis in E. coli.7 ± 9 The structural determination of PNPOx complexed with PLP aids in furthering our understanding of the catalytic mechanism and function of this enzyme, and also it locates a possible PLP non-catalytic binding site. There are two probable mechanisms for the oxidation of the C4H alcohol group to an aldehyde with the transfer of two electrons to FMN.10,11 One is a direct hydride transfer between C4H of PNP and N5 of FMN. A second possible mechanism is that a base at the active site removes a proton from C4H of PNP to generate a carbanion, which then attacks N5 of FMN forming a covalent complex between PNP and FMN. Collapse of this complex would generate PLP and FMNH2. In either mechanism the plane of the PNP ring would be expected to be parallel to the isoalloxazine ring of FMN, since the lowest energy for the bond to be broken at C4H will be when it is orthogonal to the plane of the pyridine ring of PNP. As shown in Figures 1(a) and (b) and 4 the pyridine ring of PLP is parallel to the isoalloxazine ring of FMN and the distance between C4H of PLP Ê and N5 of FMN is about 3.4 A. This distance is the same as the distance between N5 of FAD and C4 of NADP in glutathione reductase, which goes by a hydride ion transfer mechanism12 and to benzaldehyde and FMN in old yellow enzyme.13 In support of a hydride ion transfer mechanism in PNPOx the electron de®cient C4H intermediate can be stabilized by the lone electron pairs on either the C4H -hydroxyl group or by resonance stabilization from O3H . The other likely mechanism for PNPOx requires an active site base to accept a proton from C4H to generate a C4H carbanion. The accumulating negative charge on C4H occurring during this mechanism could also be stabilized by resonance into the pyridine ring of PNP to form a quinonoid type structure that is commonly observed in PLP enzymes as intermediates.2 Identifying an active site base for this mechanism is more problematic. The current structures clearly show that the conserved His199 is out of position to act as a base for the C4H hydrogen atoms, and as previously predicted forms a hydrogen bond to the O3H of PNP to help hold the pyridine ring parallel to FMN. The only group close enough to C4H to behave as an active site base is a water molecule (Wat2). When water molecules serve as proton acceptors in enzymes they are activated by bonding to other basic groups. Wat2 is hydrogen-bonded only to Asp49 (Figure 4) which would not normally be suf®cient to activate a water molecule to be a strong enough base to accept a proton from a carbon. Also, this water is characterized by a high B-factor

Active site water molecules There are a total of eight water molecules in the native E. coli PNPOx active site that either make interaction with the FMN or are located at the site where PNP or PLP bind in the complexes5. Four of these water molecules are totally conserved in all the PNPOx structures. Two of them are involved in the binding of the ribityl moiety of FMN to protein residues and a third bridges O4 of FMN and the amide nitrogen of Tyr82. These three water molecules are characterized by low B-factors. The fourth conserved water molecule makes a hydrogen bond interaction with Asp49 in all the PNPOx structures and a further hydrogen bond interaction with the oxygen on C4H in the complexes (Wat2, Table 2; Figure 4). This water molecule is characterized by a very high B-factor in all the structures. Three of the water molecules that are present in the native structure are close to the bound PLP and have been abolished in the complexes. The eighth water molecule found in the native structure Ê has shifted about 1.7 A away from the bound product to bridge the PLP (N1) and the residue Trp178 (NE1) in the PLP complexes (Wat3, Table 2; Figure 4). This water molecule is missing in the PNPOx-PNP structure. The complexes PNPOx2PLPH , PNPOx-1PLP and PNPOx-PNP have one additional water molecule in the active site that bridges the phosphate of PNP or PLP with Ser137 (OG) and Arg197 (NH2) (Wat1, Table 2; Figure 4).

cell parameters of all four complexes are similar to that of the native PNPOx structure.5 Prior to use in X-ray diffraction, the crystals were washed in a cryo-protectant solution containing 2.15 M ammonium sulfate (in 0.1 M 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonate buffer (pH 6.2)), 3.5 % (v/v) dioxane and 7.7 % (v/v) glycerol, then transferred to a similar solution containing 14.3 % glycerol. Diffraction data sets were collected at 100  K using a Molecular Structure Corporation (MSC) X-Stream Cryogenic Crystal Cooler System (Molecular Structure Corporation, The Woodlands, TX, USA), an R-Axis II image plate detector equipped with OSMIC confocal mirrors and a Rigaku RU-200 X-ray generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA. Data processing employed the BIOTEX software of MSC and the CCP4 suite.17 Statistics for the data set used in the re®nements are also listed in Table 1. Structure refinement Ê The isomorphous 1.8 A resolution of native PNPOx structure,5 omitting the FMN, bound phosphate, water molecules and all SeMet side-chains, was used as the starting model for the re®nements of all four complex structures. All re®nements were performed with the CNS program,18 with overall anisotropic B-factor correction and a bulk solvent correction. A statistically random selection of 5 % of the total re¯ection data was excluded from the re®nement and used to calculate the free R-factor (R-free) as a monitor of model bias.19 After rigid body re®nement, and subsequent conjugate gradient minimization and simulated annealing, clear densities were identi®ed for the PLP, FMN and phosphate molecules, and all deleted amino side-chains. The complexes were subsequently re®ned with alternate cycles of conjugate gradient minimization, simulated annealing and B-factor re®nements. Repeated rebuilding with TOM20 and addition of water molecules led to the ®nal re®nement statistics summarized in Table 1. Accession numbers The atomic coordinate and structure factor sets for the four structures have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with accession codes: 1G79 (PNPOx-2PLPH ); 1G78 (PNPOx-2PLP); 1G77 (PNPOx-1PLP); and 1G76 (PNPOx-PNP).

compared to the residues nearby in the protein. However, the structures observed in this study now permit testing of His199 and Asp49 as possible putative bases by site-directed mutagenesis (preliminary results show that converting each of these residues to Ala results in mutant enzymes with considerable activity; M. L. di Salvo, personal communication). Previous studies have shown that E. coli PNPOx binds PLP tightly at a non-catalytic site.3 PLP bound at this site does not inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme, but is readily transferred to aposerine hydroxymethyltransferase by a possible channeling mechanism. The role of this tightly bound PLP molecule in regulation and possible channeling of PLP warrants further study. Previous studies with rabbit PNPOx suggested that PLP might function in regulation as a feedback inhibitor of the oxidase.14 Native E. coli PNPOx shows a bound phosphate molecule, which we suggested previously might be the non-catalytic PLP binding site.5 However, in this study a second PLP is not bound at this phosphate site but at Ê another site that is 11 A from the active site. The distance between the conserved phosphate and the newly observed non-catalytic PLP site is about Ê 10 A. The result points to Asn84, Phe177 and Lys145 as being critical in binding PLP at the noncatalytic site and provides possible tests of this site by changing these residues to other amino acids. What is most intriguing about this site is its apparent connection to the active site by a tunnel. A protein tunnel has previously been shown to exist in tryptophan synthase as a method to transport the hydrophobic indole ring between indoleglycerol phosphate and serine at two different active sites on the enzyme.15 A rational for why a tunnel might exist in PNPOx is that release of PLP from the active site into the cell medium would result in rapid reaction with a host of other nucleophiles that would diminish its ability to ®nd apoenzymes that require PLP for catalytic activity. We are not sure why we only see the second PLP site when crystals are soaked with high (20 mM) concentration of PLP. We have found no evidence for other non-speci®c binding sites of PLP on this enzyme. It may be that functionally it is dif®cult to have PLP bound at both catalytic and non-catalytic sites simultaneously.
