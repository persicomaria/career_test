ABSTRACT Although bacterial iterative Type I polyketide synthases are now known to participate in the biosynthesis of a small set of diverse natural products, the subsequent downstream modification of the resulting polyketide products remains poorly understood. Toward this goal, we report the X-ray ° structure determination at 2.5 A resolution and preliminary characterization of the putative orsellenic acid P450 oxidase (CalO2) involved in calicheamicin biosynthesis. These studies represent the first crystal structure for a P450 involved in modifying a bacterial iterative Type I polyketide product and suggest the CalO2-catalyzed step may occur after CalO3-catalyzed iodination and may also require a coenzyme A- (CoA) or acyl carrier protein- (ACP) bound substrate. Docking studies also reveal a putative docking site within CalO2 for the CLM orsellinic acid synthase (CalO5) ACP domain which involves a wellordered helix along the CalO2 active site cavity that is unique compared with other P450 structures.

INTRODUCTION Because of their remarkable molecular architectures, spectacular biological activities, and therapeutic value, the enediynes are often considered among some of the most notorious natural products known to man. There exist two naturally-occurring enediyne structural sub-families--the chromoprotein (or 9-membered) enediynes and 10-membered enediynes.1,2 The chromoprotein enediynes contain a bicyclo[7.3.0]enediyne 9-membered core and typically require a specific protein for enediyne stabilization. The 10-membered enediynes share a common bicyclo[7.3.1]enediyne core and, while the 10-membered enediynes lack protein stabilizers, some producing organisms of this family rely upon a novel `self-sacrifice' resistance protein.3,4 All enediynes are highly efficient DNA/RNAdamaging agents. As exemplified by mechanistic studies of calicheamicin (CLM) I g1 (Fig. 1, 5), a prominent member of the 10-membered enediynes, the CLM aryltetrasaccharide docks in the minor groove of the target DNA to facilitate an efficiently precise, and lethal, oxidative DNA-strand scission event-initiated via a highly reactive diradical intermediate of enediyne cycloaromatization.5­8 The incredible in vitro and in vivo potency of CLM also paved the way for CLM-based therapeutics with the CLM-CD33 antibody conjugate (Mylotarg) emerging as the first approved antibody-cytotoxin based drug in 2000.9­11 This demonstrated clinical success continues to fuel both synthetic and biosynthetic efforts toward the generation of enediyne analogs with optimized therapeutic properties.12­15 Early metabolic labeling studies suggested the 9- and 10-membered enediynes derive from distinct biosynthetic pathways.16­18 In contrast, the recent cloning and characterization of gene clusters encoding both 9-membered and 10-membered enediynes revealed an enediyne polyketide synthase (PKSE) gene common to all enediyne loci and thereby established the first unified, divergent polyketide paradigm for enediyne core biosynthesis.19­25 In addition to the novel enediyne core, most enediynes also contain additional constituents of polyketide origin as exemplified by the CLM orsellenic acid moiety. The biosynthesis of such enediyne substructures (Fig. 1, 1) are catalyzed by a unique set of iterative Type I polyketide synthases

Structural Characterization of CalO2

The putative reaction catalyzed by CalO2 is highlighted within the box and the mature orsellinate progeny in the context of calicheamicin is emphasized in blue.

(PKSs) reminiscent of the fungal 6-methylsalicyclic acid synthase (6-MSAS)26 and are subsequently modified via enzymatic oxidation, halogenation and/or methylation (Fig. 1, 2?4). While bacterial iterative Type I PKSs are now known to participate in the biosynthesis of at least five diverse natural products--avilamycin,27 CLM,19 neocarzinostatin,23,28 chlorothricin,29,30 and maduropeptin24--the subsequent downstream modification of the resulting polyketide products remains poorly understood. Toward this goal, we report the X-ray structure determination of the putative CLM orsellenic acid P450 oxidase (CalO2) and subsequent ligand-binding studies in the presence of various substrate analogs. These studies represent the first crystal structure for a P450 involved in modifying a bacterial iterative Type I polyketide product and suggest the CalO2-catalyzed step may occur after CalO3-

catalyzed iodination and may also require a coenzyme A(CoA) or acyl carrier protein- (ACP) bound substrate. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein purification

The calO2 gene was amplified from M. echinospora genomic DNA using the primer pair calO2-forward (50 ggaaggggcaccatatgctggtcgatgc-30 ) and calO2-reverse (gctcat gtcgagatctcctcctgctcg) and ligated into a NdeI/SmaIdigested pUC-based plasmid. Upon confirmation via DNA sequencing, the NdeI/SmaI calO2-containing fragment was subcloned into the E. coli-Streptomyces expression shuttle vector pPW50 for expression of the N-His6-CalO2 fusion protein (referred to as CalO2 throughout this manuscript)

in Streptomyces. For constitutive expression in Streptomyces lividans a single transformant was used to inoculate starter cultures of 75 mL YEME broth containing 25 mg/mL thiostrepton in 250 mL baffled flasks with 4 g of glass beads. Cultures were grown at 288C until they reached a pinkish color, generally 2­3 days. Aliquots (500 lL) from the starter culture were subsequently used to inoculate expression cultures (75 mL YEME broth, 25 mg/mL thiostrepton in 250 mL baffled flask containing 4 g of glass beads). The expression cultures were grown 2­3 days, at which time they were supplemented with 1 mM 5-aminolevulinic acid and 750 lL of a trace elements solution (0.9 mM EDTA, 38.0 mM ZnSO4-7H2O; 18.0 mM FeSO4-7H2O; 1.9 mM CoCl2, pH 8.0). Cultures were then grown for an additional 4­5 days and cells were harvested via centrifugation (3000g, 40 min) and stored at 2808C. Following this protocol, the typical cell yield was 180 g/L. All purification steps were carried out at 48C. The cell pellet ($180 g) was resuspended in 120 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 1 mg/mL lysozyme pH 8.0) and incubated on ice for 30 min after which time the cells were lysed by sonication (Virsonic 475; Virtis, Gardiner, NY; 100 W, 8 3 45 s pulses, 1 min between pulses, 08C). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (3000g, 40 min) and the recovered supernatant was combined with 2 mL Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) and the mixture incubated on an orbital mixer (Reliable Scientific, location, 8 rpm, 48C) for 1 h. The mixture was loaded onto a disposable 5 mL column, the resin washed with 10 mL wash buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and CalO2 eluted with elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) until the red color was no longer visible on the resin ($5 mL). The CalO2-containing eluent

was concentrated to 2.5 mL via diafiltration (Vivaspin 15 mL column with Hydrosart membrane, 30 kDa MWCO, 3000g). UV-Vis analysis of protein at this stage revealed a typical absorbance at 423 nm (data not shown), indicative of an inhibitor-bound heme. The concentrated sample was exchanged with assay/storage buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0) using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and the eluent concentrated to a protein concentration of $10 mg/mL as determined by the Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), flash frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at 2808C. Upon buffer exchange, the CalO2 heme Soret peak shifted to a single peak at 418 nm, indicative of low spin iron bound to water. The reduced carbon monoxide bound form of NHis6-CalO2 displayed a typical P450 Soret peak at 450 nm [Fig. 2(A)] with a small amount of the inactive P420 form which was found to increase over time [Fig. 2(B)].
Ligand binding

An array of benzoic acid analogs [Fig. 3(A)] were selected as possible CalO2 substrates or substrate mimics. The selected commercially available aromatic acids were converted to their sodium salts by dissolving 100 mg of acid in methanol to which a molar equivalent of 2M NaOH was added. The corresponding mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h, at which time the solvents were removed under vacuum. The N-acetyl cysteamine (SNAc) derivatives 11­15 for this study were synthesized from the commercially available acids using standard procedures.31 Specifically, to a solution of carboxylic acid (1 equiv) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (1.2 equiv) in THF (10 mL) was added dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (1.2 equiv in THF), followed by N-acetylcysteamine (1.0­5.0

For both the acid salts and SNAc derivatives, stock solutions (250 mM) were prepared in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0 for the studies described. Binding assays were conducted with 15 mM CalO2 in 400 lL 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 258C in a 1 mL quartz cuvette using a Beckman-Coulter, DU800. Assays were initiated by titrating ligands into the assay mixture over a range of 0.06­8 mM and the difference spectra (blanked against 15 mM CalO2 in 400 lL 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 and corrected for ligand absorbance) were recorded after equilibration (typically 5 min). Although ligand solubility prohibited ligand saturation in most cases, Kd values were estimated using difference spectra at five different ligand concentrations.

integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 package.32 The data were phased by molecular replacement via MOLREP.33,34 A number of P450 homologs (both with and without sidechains) were initially used as MR models without success. Eventually, a homology model was generated with Jackal using the sequence of CalO2 and the coordinates of Streptomyces venezuelae PikC (33% identity, PDB ID 2BVJ).35 This resulted in a solution with a slightly improved correlation coefficient and a map that visually corresponded to certain portions of the output structure. Regions of the model that did not fit the electron density were removed and the resulting structure was used as the model in another molecular replacement run. This process was repeated multiple times until an optimal molecular replacement solution was achieved. Phases were further improved using density modification as implemented in DM36 and the structure was finalized through multiple rounds of model building with Coot and refinement with REFMAC.37,38 TLS groups, selected based on the output of the TLSMD web server,39 were incorporated during the final stages of refinement.40 Relevant crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table I. Structure figures were generated in PyMOL.41 In an attempt to further understand the improvement in the molecular replacement solution solved with the Jackal calculated homology model, the final structure was aligned with PikC (2BVJ), the homology model calculated by Jackal, and the final truncated homology model. This revealed that there was a negative correlation

Buffer exchange for protein used in crystallization experiments was carried out by diafiltration (Vivaspin 15 mL column with Hydrosart membrane, 30 kDa MWCO, 3000g). The protein solution used for crystallization optimization contained 7 mg/mL CalO2 in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). CalO2 crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method. The reservoir solution contained 10% (w/v) methyl ether polyethylene glycol 5000, 1.44 M tetramethylammonium chloride, and 100 mM triethanolamine (pH 8.0). The hanging drop consisted of 2 lL of protein solution mixed with 2 lL of reservoir solution. Crystallization trays were stored at 293 K. Under these conditions, CalO2 crystals required 2 weeks to reach full size (100 3 100 3 100 lm3). Crystals were subsequently soaked in increasing concentrations of ethylene glycol in mother liquor up to a final concentration of 20% (v/v) and flash-frozen in a stream of liquid nitrogen.

Docking studies

A homology model for the acyl-carrier protein (ACP) domain of the iterative PKS CalO5 (residues 1181 through 1257) was constructed with Jackal using the ACP coordinates from Protein Data Bank entry 1ACP. The ACP homology model coordinates and CalO2 coordinates were subsequently submitted to the ClusPro web server,42,43 and putative complexes were obtained using both DOT and ZDOCK docking software.44,45 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Protein characterization and ligand binding

very weak perturbation of the heme spectrum was observed with free acids 6­8, indicative of weak active-site binding, wherein the iodo-substituted analogs 7 and 8 led to the greatest perturbation. Stronger association was observed in the presence of SNAc variants with iodination again critical for affinity (12 Kd 5 0.2 Æ 0.6 lM lM > 13 Kd 5 120 lM Æ 40 lM > 11 Kd 5 170 Æ 30 lM > 14 Kd 5 405 Æ 100 lM). This cumulative analysis suggests a substrate thioester conjugate (e.g. ACP or CoA) and the iodine are important for CalO2 recognition and thus, CalO3-catalyzed iodination may occur prior to CalO2catalyzed hydroxylation as illustrated in Figure 1.
Structure quality and overall fold

P450s are known to participate in a variety of biosynthetic transformations including general oxidation, oxidative coupling reactions, oxidative degradative reactions, and a plethora of aliphatic/aromatic hydroxylations.46­49 Two P450-encoding genes (calO2 and calE10) reside within the calicheamicin biosynthetic locus.19 The calO2 gene is co-localized within a subcluster containing calO1 (AdoMet-dependent aromatic O-methyltransferase), calO3 (a flavin-dependent halogenase), calO4 (3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase III), calO5 (orsellinic acid synthase, iterative type I PKS), and calO6 (AdoMet-dependent aromatic Omethyltransferase). In contrast, calE10 is located in a distinct location and has recently been characterized as the aminosugar oxidase responsible for the biosynthesis of a novel hydroxylaminosugar nucleotide aryltetrasaccharide precursor en route to CLM (Johnson, H.; Thorson, J. S., unpublished). Given the common role of P450s in aromatic hydroxylation, the localization of calO2 within the set of genes associated with the biosynthesis and modification of the iterative type I PKS product, and the in vitro characterization of CalE10 as a specific aminosugar oxidase, CalO2 has been put forth as the putative orsellinate hydroxylase ­ prior to, or after, iodination (see Fig. 1). Despite the ability to purify the recombinant holoCalO2 from S. lividans, attempts to reconstitute the in vitro activity of CalO2 using a variety of electron transport systems (including the successful spinach ferredoxin/spinach ferredoxin reductase system for the related CalE10) were unsuccessful. To assess the interaction of CalO2 with the putative substrates employed for these in vitro assays, a series of ligand-binding studies were subsequently pursued (see Fig. 3). From this analysis,

The CalO2 model was refined to a nominal resolution ° of 2.47 A. The model included all 397 residues encoded by the calO2 gene, however; there was insufficient electron density to build in the N-terminal His-tag. In addition to one chain of CalO2, the asymmetric unit contained a heme group and 82 water molecules. The final model was refined to an R and Rfree of 19.8% and 25.7%. All of the amino acid residues were in energy allowed regions of a Ramachandran plot. Additional model statistics are listed in Table I. The structure factors as well as the final coordinates have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank under ID 3BUJ. The enzyme core is a four-helix bundle made up of helices D, E, I, and L (see Fig. 4). The heme group is localized between helices I and L and sits at the bottom of a deep cavity wherein Cys343 serves as the heme iron axial ligand and resides on the loop directly preceeding helix L. In addition to the core domain, the active site cavity is also defined by the two-helix bundle containing helices B0 and B@, the loops between helices F and G, as well as the b-sheets b1 and b4. The distance between the heme iron and the surface ° of the protein is 27.5 A.
Comparison to other P450 enzymes

The overall fold of CalO2 is very similar to that of other P450 enzymes with the most dramatic alteration occurring between residues 54 through 81 (helices B0 and B@) of CalO2, a key structural variable region among P450s. In many P450s this region forms a random loop that defines multiple solvent channels to provide substrates active site access.50,51 In contrast, this region in CalO2 forms a two-helix bundle that blocks many of the solvent channels observed in previous P450 structures while maintaining a large central opening for substrate access to the active site. With the exception of the axial ligand (Cys343), only two polar groups (Thr233 and ° ° Thr237, 5.4 A and 5.3 A, respectively) are within close proximity of the CalO2 heme iron, one of which (Thr237) is highly conserved among P450 enzymes and is believed to form a hydrogen bond with the ironPROTEINS

coordinated dioxygen intermediate.52 In contrast, sequence analysis reveals that Thr233 appears to be relatively unique among P450 enzymes (see Fig. 5). The uniqueness of this residue in the CalO2 active site suggests that it may play a role in substrate recognition. Analysis of natural product-related P450 complexes-- including P450eryF bound to androstendione (PDB ID 1eup),53 P450NOR complexed with 3-pyridinealdehyde adenine dinucleotide (PDB ID 1xqd),54 StaP bound to chromopyrrolic acid (PDB ID 2z3u),55 and PikC complexed with narbomycin (PDB ID 2c7x) and YC-17 (PDB ID 2cd8)56--reveal a predominance of nonconserved hydrophobic contributions to substrate recognition with few common hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. In addition to the putative role of Thr233 highlighted in previous paragraph, another exception to this general hydrophobic-binding model includes Arg67 in StaP--postulated to coordinate a carboxyl group of chromopyrrolic acid. As illustrated in Figure 6, the homologous residue (Arg55) in CalO2 could potentially be involved in substrate recognition. CalO2 Arg341 substitutes for a histidine common to many P450s (see Fig. 5) and may therefore, also be involved in CalO2-substrate specific interactions. Finally, CalO2 Phe383 is homologous to Phe403 in StaP, which is involved in T-stacking p-p interactions with the aromatic chromopyrrolic acid in StaP. Thus, CalO2 Phe383 may play a similar role in binding the aromatic orsellinate substrate in CalO2.

As previously described, the lack of successful reconstitution of CalO2 activity in vitro may be due to the requirement of ACP- or CoA-thioester substrate conjugates. Consistent with this, a CalO2 BLAST search revealed the strongest homology to BioI (33% identity), a P450 known to act upon an ACP bound substrate.57 Similar protein-bound substrates have been established for other biosynthetic P450s including NovI (novobiocin biosynthesis), NikQ (nikkomycin biosynthesis), and OxyB (vancomycin biosynthesis).58­61 Although an ACP-binding consensus among such biosynthetic P450s has not been determined, docking algorithms have been used to accurately predict residues that may be critical to ACP binding.62 In addition, a number of bacterial ACP protein complex structures have been solved by crystallography.63­65 These studies reveal binding to primarily engage helix 2 of the ACP and involve a network of acidic and hydrophobic residues on the ACP interacting with a series of basic and hydrophobic residues on the respective protein. In an effort to assess the feasibility of an interaction between CalO2 and an ACP-bound substrate, docking simulations were subsequently conducted. The top ten simulated solutions from both ZDOCK and DOT were analyzed. Four of the top eight solutions from ZDOCK placed the ACP domain near the active site of the molecule. Of these, two oriented the conserved ACP serine (which would bear the pantetheine arm conjugated to the substrate) into the active site. Notably, the model complex predicted by both ZDOCK and DOT (see Fig. 7) most closely resembles the ACP-protein complex structures described in the literature. In this model, helix 2 of the CalO5 ACP domain interacts with helix B0 of CalO2. In contrast to previous structures, the two helices both contain a mixture of positively charged and negatively charged residues (CalO2 helix 4--Gly57, Ile58, Arg59, Arg60, Phe61, Trp62, Thr63, Asp64, Leu65, and Val66; CalO5 ACP domain--Met1214, Asp1215, Ser1216, Val1217, Met1218, Thr1219, Val1220, Ile1221, Val1222, Arg1223, Arg1224, and Arg1225). In the docked CalO2CalO5 ACP model, the parallel orientation of the two interacting helices maintain correct electrostatic interactions despite the electrostatic heterogeneity of the two helices. Additional regions of interaction, derived from this model, are also highlighted in Figure 5. The docked CalO2-CalO5 ACP model places Ser1216 directly up against the edge of the open cleft on the surface of CalO2. Ser1216 is the homolog of Ser36 in Escherichia coli ACP that is covalently attached to the pantetheinate group. The distance between the modeled iodoorsellinic ° acid and Ser1216 is 19 A. Given that the reach of the ° pantetheinate arm is $18 A, this model suggests that the proposed ACP-linked substrate could reach directly into the active site as opposed to being released from the ACP and diffusing the rest of the way into the active site.

The iodoorsellinic acid group is modeled into the active site and a line is drawn between the sidechain oxygen of Ser1216 (homolog of Ser36 in Escherichia coli ACP) and the carboxyl oxygen of the modeled substrate to depict the expected path of the proposed pantetheine group. Additional helices are labeled as in Fig. 4.

Structural Characterization of CalO2

CONCLUSIONS We have determined the crystal structure of CalO2, a P450 enzyme responsible for the modification of a bacterial iterative type I polyketide product. In addition, we have probed the active site affinity for a number of substrate analogs. The results suggest that the CalO2 reaction follows substrate iodination and may require the presence of a CoA or ACP bound substrate. Structural analysis of CalO2 revealed a two helix bundle lining the active site cavity which docking studies indicate could serve as a binding site in a putative CalO2 CalO5 binding interaction.
