SUMMARY

I. Adminstered insulin promotes an increase in the I form of liver glycogen transferase (UDPG: ~-1,4-glucan ~-4-glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4. I. I I) less effectively when infused into pancreatectomized dogs made "diabetic", b y deprivation of maintenance insulin for 2-4 days, than into such dogs "controlled" by daily insulin. Since an increase in transferase I is probably promoted b y transferase D phosphatase, a decrease in the activity of this enzyme was sought as a possible explanation for this kind of insulin resistance. 2. I t was found that insulin(3.2 units/kg per h)-with-glucose (2.5 g/kg per h) infused into "controlled" dogs promoted a several-fold increase in phosphatase activit y within 5-15 min. Glucagon added to the insulin-with-glucose infusion brought phosphatase activity back to control levels or below, within 6 min. 3. This rapid activation-inactivation of phosphatase by hormones suggests the existence of two activities of phosphatase which are interconverted enzymatically and exhibit different degrees of stimulation b y Mg ~+. 4. In "diabetic" dogs no change in phosphatase activity was brought about by a similar infusion of insulin-with-glucose for 3o-12o rain. 5. I t is suggested that in insulin deficiency the activating factor for liver transferase D phosphatase is either lacking or ineffective.

INTRODUCTION

Insulin is known 1-~ to promote an increase in the I form of liver glycogen transferase (UPDG : ~-I, 4-glucan a-4-glucosyltransferase, EC 2.4. i. I I). This increase occurs rapidly in the normal 2 and in the recently alloxanized diabetic animal ~. However, when insulin deficiency exists for a longer time this insulin response either is delayed and can be prevented by inhibitors of protein synthesis 1, or is less marked than normal 5. The cause of this kind of insulin resistance is unknown.

INSULIN AND GLYCOGENTRANSFERASED PHOSPHATASE

209

The proportion of liver transferase in the I form at any given time is a reflection of the balance between the activity of the enzymic factor which promotes the activating (D to I form) conversion 6 and that which promotes the inactivating (I to D form) conversion 7. In this respect, liver appears to resemble muscle where these conversions have been found to be promoted by transferase D phosphatase and transferase I kinase, respectivelys. The effect of insulin is thought to involve a disturbance of this balance of the phosphatase andkinase activity. On the one hand in liver 9 and in adipose tissue 1°, a decrease in kinase activity has been postulated because under certain conditions insulin promotes a lowering of the cellular concentration of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-phosphate (3',5'-AMPZ), a known stimulator of the kinase, in vitro. Alternatively, in skeletal muscle, no decrease in 3',5'-AMP concentration was found under conditions of insulin administration known to activate transferase12, 24. However, a decrease in kinase activity was found when assayed without added 3',5'-AMP, but no change in kinase activity was found when 3',5'-AMP was included in the crude e x t r a c t ) ~ On the other hand, an increase in phosphatase activity, with no change in kinase activity, would also result in transferase activation, as has been suggested by several investigators~3-~5o 9. A decrease in phosphatase activity would have the opposite effect and would ,furthermore, promote the appearance of a state of resistance to the action of insulin. The present paper describes measurements of transferase D phosphatase activity in serial liver biopsies collected during experiments in pancreatectomized dogs which had been rendered severely insulin-deficient by withholding daily maintainance insulin for several days. It was found that an infusion of insulin-with-glucose for 3o-12o rain promoted no change in the phosphatase activity in extracts of these livers. On the other hand, when the same dogs were maintained with daily insulin injections a comparable insulin infusion resulted in a doubling of phosphatase activity within 5-15 min. This insulin-induced activation of phosphatase was quickly reversed by a subsequent injection of glucagon. When phosphatase was assayed in 3 mM EDTA but without added MgC12 (IO mM), the activity change brought about by hormones was amplified 2-4-fold. This rapid activation-inactivation of phosphatase by hormones suggests the existence of two forms of phosphatase in normal liver. Furthermore, it is suggested that the inability to activate transferase D phosphatase rapidly with insulin is at least partially responsible for the abnormally slow activation of liver transferase seen in diabetic animals. METHODS The procedures of pancreatectomy, post-operative maintenance, and collection of liver samples by percutaneous needle biopsy during intravenous infusion of insulinwith-glucose* and of glucose alone have been described elsewhere 5. Frozen liver samples were stored at --60 ° for up to 3 months without apparent further loss of phosphatase activity. Liver biopsy samples, 15-9o mg, were homogenized for I min, using ground glass microhomogenizers (Micrometric Instrument Co., Cleveland, Ohio), and extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 12 ooo x g for 20 min at 4 °. Except where indicated * Recrystallized trypsin-treated porcine insulin had less than 0.005% glucagon by weight.

otherwise, the "homogenization medium" was 8 vol of o.oo 4 M EDTA, o.oo5 M dithiothreitol, O.OLOM Na2SOa, and 0.050 M Tris-HC1 (pH 8.2) containing IO mg/ml rabbit liver glycogen. The extract, 0.050 ml, combined either with 0.o20 ml of glassdistilled water, of 0.04 ° M MgC12 or of 0.800 M KF, was brought to 3 °0 for 2 min before the phosphatase assay was started by the addition of O.OLOml of purified transferase D prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle 1.. The transferase D, 4 ° units/ml, had been diluted i :4 in the homogenization medium and preincubated separately for 30 rain at 3 o°. The course of the transferase D to I conversion reaction was observed at I- or 2-min intervals b y withdrawing, and diluting (I :15) with homogenization medium, O.OLO ml of the assay mixture. Transferase I and transferase D activity was then estimated by measuring the rate of conversion of UDP-E14Cjglucose to ~14C~glycogen, using a test mixture 17 fortified with 0.020 M EDTA and 0.025 M KF. The protein content of extracts, following precipitation with 5 % trichloroacetic acid, was estimated according to LOWRY et al? 8. The glucose concentration of whole blood, treated with NaF, was measured with an automated ferricyanide method.
RESULTS

Liver transferase I kinase in "diabetic" pancreatectomized dogs
In a preliminary study transferase I kinase was extracted and partially purified 7 from livers of normal glucose-fed dogs and of pancreatectomized "diabetic" dogs. When these preparations were testedL using supplemental transferase I (ref. I6), it appeared that transferase I kinase was present in "diabetic" liver in approximately normal amounts.

Liver transferase D phosphatase in "diabetic" pancreatectomized dogs
Transferase D phosphatase activity was much lower in extracts of the liver from pancreatectomized "diabetic" dogs than in those from glucose-fed normal dogs (Fig. IB). This was apparent even though the "diabetic" liver had more total extractible transferase and had more of the transferase in the D form. Although the"diabetic" liver is very fatty, it was found that phosphatase was as completely extracted from "diabetic" liver as from "non-diabetic" liver. In five "controlled" and in twelve "diabetic" homogenates assayed, both before and after centrifugation (12ooo×g), 9 9 ~ I 3 % and l O O ~ I 6 % of the phosphatase activity was present in the extract, respectively. In order to determine if the "diabetic" liver contained a soluble inhibitor of phosphatase, an extract, made after homogenizing together equal weights of "diabetic and normal glucose-fed liver, was assayed. This mixed extract was found to have about the phosphatase activity expected if normal liver extract was diluted by an equal volume of inactive extract having a greater transferase D concentration (Fig. IB). In order to minimize the variations in phosphatase activity resulting solely from differences in transferase D concentration in the extract, see Fig. IA, phosphatase was subsequently assayed with a standard substrate concentration of about I unit of transferase D per ml. This was accomplished by supplementing the extracts with purified transferase D, prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle, which was found to be a substrate for transferase D phosphatase of dog liver. Fig. 2 shows, in a typical assay, that phosphatase from a normal dog infused with insulin was 4 times as active

as that from a pancreatectomized dog allowed to become "diabetic" by withholding insulin administration for 3 days. A linear increase in transferase I/ml of assay mixture occurred in early time periods (4-8 min), and a smaller increase in total transferase also occurred. When the phosphatase was very active and more than one-half the added transferase D was converted to I, the assay became non-linear, presumably

because substrate became limiting. Complete inhibition of the phosphatase occurred with 0.200 M KF. Table I shows that dilution of the 1:3 liver extract an additional 3and Io-fold resulted in no change in the specific activity of phosphatase. Furthermore, a preliminary study of the dependence of phosphatase activity (+Mg*+)upon the concentration of added substrate suggested a similar Km for supplemental transferase D (3.4~3-I and 6.2~2.5 units/ml) in contrast to a 4-fold difference in the Vmax (o.o93~o.o 9 and o.4oo:~o.I5O units/miD per ml) in the "diabetic" and in the normal glucose-fed dogs, respectively. These studies would seem to suggest that neither the presence of an activator nor of an inhibitor would explain the observed differences in phosphatase activity extracted from "diabetic" and "non-diabetic" liver.

Preliminary observations in separate" diabetic" and normal dogs indicated that a more pronounced change in phosphatase activity occurred with insulin infusion in the normal than in the "diabetic" animal. In order to eliminate the possibility that this valiation resulted from a chance difference in dogs selected or in the variable trauma of opening the abdomen for the liver biopsy, it was decided to perform both tests of insulin responsiveness in the same animal, collecting the liver samples by percutaneous needle biopsy under short-acting general anesthesia (sodium thiamylal N.F. (Sulital, Parke-Davis)). Pancreatectomized dogs, more than 3 weeks postoperative, were used : (I) as "controlled", while their insulin deficiency was controlled (usually a-glycosuric) with twice daily insulin injections, and (2) as "diabetic", after this maintenance insulin was withheld for I-4 days, and the dogs exhibited 1-3 days of glucosuria of more than 60 g /day.

Table II shows data obtained from three pancreatectomized dogs allowed to become "diabetic" by withholding of daily maintenance insulin for I, 2, or 4 days. The activity of liver transferase D phosphatase was 3.4~o.8 units transferase D converted to I per miD per g protein. In five experiments insulin was infused combined with glucose for 3o-15o miD. In these experiments no change in phosphatase activity was observed. Whole blood glucose concentration was elevated (44o mg/Ioo ml) and remained so during the infusions of insulin-with-glucose (640 mg/Ioo ml).

In two dogs (No. 7, 8) a 3o-min infusion of glucose alone (1.5-2.5 g/kg per h) produced no change in the phosphatase activity. In these dogs, when insulin (3.2 units/kg per h)was added to this glucose infusion phosphatase activity increased about 2-fold within 5-15 min. In two dogs (No. 6, i i ) a progressive 2-fold increase in phosphatase activity occurred during the 3o-min glucose infusion such that addition of insulin to the subsequent 3o-min glucose infusion resulted in no further increase.

Interconversion of two activities of transferase D phosphatase
Crystalline glucagon (20 mg/kg) injected intravenously during the infusion of insulin-with-glucose, resulted in a decrease in phosphatase activity to below control levels, within 6 min*. This 2-fold difference in phosphatase activity before and after glucagon administration was amplified to a 6-9-fold difference if the assay was made in the presence of 3 mM EDTA, without added Mg*+ (Table IV). When the data of Tables IV and III are compared, it is seen, in Expts. 8 and II, that glucagon administration resulted in a change in the ratio of phosphatase activities (--Mg2+/+Mg2+) from 0.90 to 0.30.

conversion of phosphatase from a Mg~+-independent activity to a relatively Mg 2+dependent activity, as recognized by the conditions of the assay. Since glucagon is known to promote the accummulation of 3',5'-AMP and the consequent stimulation of an ATP-Mg~+-requiring kinase, it was reasoned that glucagon might stimulate a here-to-fore unknown kinase acting on transferase D phosphatase. If so, then the Mg2+-dependent phosphatase activity might be a phosphoprotein which is susceptible to a here-to-fore unknown phosphatase which promotes the conversion to the Mg2+-independent activity (as with insulin-with-glucose, in vivo).

thesis it was reasoned that such a conversion, or activation, might occur with incubation of a crude homogenate under conditions when ATP and 3',5'-AMP would be expected to become increasingly low in concentration. Fig. 3 shows phosphatase activity (--Mg ~+ and + M g 2+) measured at 3o-min intervals during an incubation, at 20 °, of an 8o00 × g extract of liver from each of two normal dogs homogenized in 3 vol. of glycylglycine (pH 7.4) (ref. 19). It is seen, during the first 30 min of incubation, that phosphatase activity became increasingly Mg ~+dependent. In the subsequent 30 min phosphatase became largely Mg2+-independent and remained so for another 30 min.

Changes ill phosphatase activity ( + M g 2+ and --Mg ~+) during incubation (20 °) of extract (8o00 × g) of fresh liver homogenized in 3 vol. of o.Ioo M glycylglycine (pH 7.4). Aliquots of incubate were removed at indicated intervals and diluted with 1.25 vol. of 1.8 times concentrated homogenization medium before phosphatase assay (see METHODS). The glucose-fed normal dog was injected intravenously with glucagon (Io/~g/ kg), 6 min before removal of the liver, in order to reduce the activity of phosphatase. DISCUSSION

It was thought that a decrease in the activity of transferase D phosphatase might provide an explanation of a type of insulin resistance seen in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Such insulin resistance is indicated experimentally by the observation s that an insulin infusion is less effective in activating transferase in the liver of pancreatectomized dogs allowed to become "diabetic " for 2 or 4 days than in the same dogs whose diabetes is "controlled" by daily insulin injections. However, the experimental situation in which transferase D phosphatase was less active in the "diabetic" than in the normal or "controlled" dog was observed after an insulin infusion and not before it. This fact suggests the existence of an activating factor for the phosphatase, which factor is stimulated by insulin-with-glucose, in vivo. Therefore, it is not the activity of the phosphatase which decreases with insulin deficiency but rather the ability of the phosphatase to be activated. The inability to activate phosphatase with insulin infusion in the "diabetic" dog indicates that it probably is not insulin itself which activates the phosphatase but rather that the activating factor for the phosphatase is lacking (or ineffective) in the "diabetic" dog. The activation of phosphatase was also found to occur during an incubation of

a liver extract, in vitro. The experimental conditions were those of GOLD AND SEGAL19. These authors found that a 3o-min lag period occurred before rat liver transferase activity increased during incubation at 20 ° when the homogenate was made in glycylglycine (pH 7.4) without added Mg 2+. When homogenization was done in io mM Mg ~+ and io mM glutathione, this lag period was less apparent 15. In our studies of the dog liver system separate assays of phosphatase activity were made (+Mg2+/--Mg 2+) at intervals during the incubation, using supplements of transferase D, before estimating transferase activity. It was found that phosphatase increased in activity after about 3 ° rain of incubation. Since phosphatase is essentially inactive when assayed minus Mg 2+ during this lag period, the observations of MERSMANN AND SEGAL15 and GOLD AND SEGAL 19, would seem to be explained in terms of the time-course of phosphatase activation in this crude system. The cause of the lag period, before phosphatase activation, seen in vitro but not in vivo, remains to be elucidated. The increase in phosphatase activity produced during the insulin infusion in the "controlled" dog is apparently not the result of an activator (nor is an inhibitor of phosphatase activity present in the diabetic), according to the mixing and the diluting experiments (viz. Fig. I B and Table I). Instead, the rapid activation-inactivation of phosphatase by insulin-with-glucose and by glucagon suggests that there is an interconversion between two activities of phosphatase. I t is possible that liver resembles the adrenal in which it has been shown that phosphorylase phosphatase is inactivated by glucagon and by the addition of 3'5'-AMP, in vitro ~°. However, by inverse analogy with liver phosphorylase kinase 19 the hypothetical enzyme which might inactivate active transferase D phosphatase m a y be a 3',5'-AMP-sensitive kinase since glucagon administration brings about this change, at the same time as it promotes an increase in liver 3',5'-AMP concentration 5. The change in the ratio (--Mg~+/~-Mg ~+) of phosphatase activity from 0. 9 with glucose-insulin to 0.3 with glucagon in vivo, and the reverse change b y incubation, in vitro, suggests that the two activities of phosphatase differ in the dependence of their assayed activity upon the concentration of Mg ~+ in the assay mixture. Further studies are in progress to identify these differences. It is suggested that insulin alone appears to be responsible both for stimulating and for maintaining the activating system for phosphatase. Not only does insulinwith-glucose rapidly activate phosphatase in the normal and "controlled" state, but if insulin is withheld for 24 h or more this ability to activate phosphatase by the same agent(s) is lost. On the other hand, a glucose infusion alone promotes a slow activation of phosphatase in some "controlled" animals. In order to preserve a unitary concept of the insulin regulation of phosphatase activity, it is suggested that a high cellular glucose concentration m a y in some way slow the rate of phosphatase inactivation. Thus, a glucose infusion alone would result in a net increase in phosphatase activity if the activating effect of insulin was already established. This kind of speculation m a y provide a plausible explanation for the apparent effect of glucose alone to activate transferase in the isolated perfused liver from normal fed rats, referred to by GLINSMANN"et a l Y . However, others consider that glucose alone, and not insulin regulates the rate of liver glycogen synthesis 2a. Two reports of hormonal influences on the transferase D phosphatase seem to implicate insulin in the maintainance of phosphatase activity.

ase D phosphatase is very low but is restored with insulin administration **. In the adrenalectomized rat a 48-h fast diminishes liver phosphatase activity and hydrocortisone restores this activity to that found before the fast 15. Although these authors ascribe the effect to the administration of hydrocortisone, it seems possible that, as in the study of KREUTNER AND GOLDBERG 4, it is the insulin evoked from the pancreas by the return of the plasma glucose to normal with hydrocortisone administration which is responsible for the reactivation of the phosphatase. In each of these studies effects of hormone were not observed sooner than 60 min in contrast to the effect in 15 rain or less in the present work. An insulin effect also to decrease the activity of transferase I kinase, as has been suggested 1~ is not excluded by these experiments. Therefore, it is probable that the effect of insulin to activate liver glycogen synthetase is the summation of several influences acting in concert, and further study will be needed to elucidate the primary site(s) of insulin action.
