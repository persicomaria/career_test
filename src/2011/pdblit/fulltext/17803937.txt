SUMMARY

Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) cause cancer and skeletal disorders. Comparison of the crystal structures of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated wild-type FGFR2 kinase domains with those of seven unphosphorylated pathogenic mutants reveals an autoinhibitory ``molecular brake'' mediated by a triad of residues in the kinase hinge region of all FGFRs. Structural analysis shows that many other RTKs, including PDGFRs, VEGFRs, KIT, CSF1R, FLT3, TEK, and TIE, are also subject to regulation by this brake. Pathogenic mutations activate FGFRs and other RTKs by disengaging the brake either directly or indirectly.
INTRODUCTION Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of RTKs are responsible for many forms of human cancers, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors (KIT and PDGFRa) (Corless et al., 2004, 2005; Medeiros et al., 2004), acute myeloid leukemia and acute promyelocytic leukemia (FLT3) (Gilliland, 2003; Liang et al., 2003; Schittenhelm et al., 2006; Yamamoto et al., 2001), juvenile hemangioma (VEGFR2/3) (Walter et al., 2002), glioblastoma (FGFR1) (Rand et al., 2005), endometrial cancer (FGFR2) (Pollock et al., 2007), multiple myeloma (FGFR3) (Chesi et al., 1997; Richelda et al., 1997), and bladder and cervical cancers (FGFR3) (Cappellen et al., 1999; van Rhijn et al., 2002). Gain-of-function mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 kinase domains (FGFR2K and FGFR3K) also give rise to some of the most devastating forms of human craniosynostosis (premature fusion of skeletal sutures) and dwarfism syndromes such as Crouzon syndrome (CS),

Pfeiffer syndrome (PS), achondroplasia (ACH), hypochondroplasia (HCH), thanatophoric dysplasia type I (TDI), thanatophoric dysplasia type II (TDII), and severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans (SADDAN) (Passos-Bueno et al., 1999; Webster and Donoghue, 1997; Wilkie, 2005; Wilkin et al., 2001). Other human diseases are also linked to activating mutations in kinase domain of RTKs such as inherited venous malformations (TEK) (Calvert et al., 1999; Vikkula et al., 1996) and lymphoedema (VEGFR3) (Karkkainen et al., 2000). Screening of patients with craniosynostosis has led to the identification of a total of nine distinct mutations in FGFR2K, accounting for $10% of patients with craniosynostosis (de Ravel et al., 2005; Kan et al., 2002; McGillivray et al., 2005; Zankl et al., 2004). These mutations are K526E, N549H, N549T, E565A, E565G, K641R, K659N, G663E, and R678G. The N549H, N549T, E565G, E565A, and K641R mutations map onto the kinase hinge (the linker between b5 strand and aD helix) or its vicinity, whereas K659N and R678G map onto the activation loop (A loop) or its vicinity (Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). The K526E mutation maps onto the aC helix in the kinase N lobe. In addition, screening of patients with endometrial cancer also identified two activating mutations, N549K and K659E, in FGFR2K (Pollock et al., 2007). Mutations at asparagine residues, corresponding to N549 of FGFR2, in FGFR1, FGFR3, and PDGFRa are also implicated in human diseases. Specifically, mutations of N540 to T, S, or K in FGFR3 lead to HCH, a mild form of dwarfism (Bellus et al., 1995; DeutzTerlouw et al., 1998; Grigelioniene et al., 2000; Mortier et al., 2000), the N546K mutation in FGFR1 is found in glioblastomas (Rand et al., 2005), and the N659K mutation in PDGFRa results in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Corless et al., 2005; Medeiros et al., 2004). Mutations of K650 in FGFR3, corresponding to K659 of FGFR2, give rise to different clinical entities of varying severity, ranging from HCH (K650Q/N) to SADDAN (K650M) to neonatal lethal

TDII (K650E) (Bellus et al., 2000). The TDII and SADDAN mutations in FGFR3 are also implicated in multiple myeloma (Chesi et al., 1997; Richelda et al., 1997) and bladder and cervical cancers (Cappellen et al., 1999). Mutation of K650 to threonine has also been reported in some bladder cancers (van Rhijn et al., 2002). In this report, we compared the crystal structures of unphosphorylated and A loop tyrosine phosphorylated wild-type FGFR2Ks with those of seven unphosphorylated mutant FGFR2Ks, each harboring a distinct pathogenic mutation (Table 1). We found that these mutations cause constitutive activation of FGFR2 kinase by disengaging a ``molecular brake'' that is conserved in a wide range of RTKs.

promote more readily ligand-independent A loop tyrosine phosphorylation.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The FGFR2K Pathogenic Mutations Activate the Kinase Domain Constitutively We compared the intrinsic kinase activity of the unphosphorylated and A loop tyrosine phosphorylated wild-type FGFR2Ks with that of the nine unphosphorylated mutant kinases by measuring the rates of tyrosine autophosphorylation (Figure 1A) and peptide substrate phosphorylation (Figure 1B). All nine FGFR2K mutants demonstrated elevated autophosphorylation activity relative to the unphosphorylated wild-type kinase, ranging from 7-fold to as high as 32-fold. Compared to unphosphorylated wild-type kinase, all mutant kinases also exhibited increased capacity to phosphorylate peptide substrate. We then selected E565A and K659N mutants as the representatives of kinase hinge and A loop hotspot region mutants, respectively, to determine the steady-state kinetic parameters with two different peptide substrates. The data showed that these two mutations activate FGFR2 kinase primarily by increasing the Vmax (over 45-fold in the case of E565A) (Table S1). Our autophosphorylation and peptide substrate phosphorylation data clearly demonstrate that all nine pathogenic FGFR2K mutations activate the kinases constitutively. We also investigated the role of A loop tyrosine phosphorylation in the mechanism of kinase activation by the pathogenic mutations. For this study, we selected K526E, E565A, and K659N mutants because each mutation maps to a distinct location in kinase domain, i.e., the kinase hinge region, the aC helix, and the A loop, respectively. To this end, we purified an A loop phosphorylated version of K526E, E565A, and K659N mutants and compared the kinase activity of the A loop phosphorylated version of these mutants with that of these mutant kinases in unphosphorylated state. Unphosphorylated and phosphorylated wild-type kinase served as controls. As shown in Figure 1C, A loop phosphorylation further elevated the kinase activity of all three mutant kinases. However, the degree of kinase activation by phosphorylation for mutant kinases is lower ($2- to 7-fold) than that for wild-type kinase ($9-fold). Taken together, these data show that the pathogenic mutations

Structural Basis by which Tyrosine Phosphorylation on the A Loop Enhances FGFR2 Kinase Activity We first solved the crystal structures of unphosphorylated wild-type FGFR2K as well as A loop tyrosine phosphorylated wild-type FGFR2K in complex with a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog and peptide substrate. The peptide substrate used for cocrystallization is derived from the C-terminal tail of FGFR2 (residues 764­778) and contains Y769, one of the major autophosphorylation sites of FGFR2. Both wild-type FGFR2Ks adopt the canonical bilobate structure of protein serine/tyrosine kinases (Hubbard and Till, 2000) (Figures 2A and 2B). Comparison of the two structures reveals two critical changes that occur in the kinase domain upon A loop tyrosine phosphorylation. At the global level, the N lobe of the kinase undergoes an inward rotation (6.7 degrees) toward the C lobe (Figures S2A, S3A, and S6 and Table S2), which coincides with a major rearrangement of the phosphorylated A loop at the local level (Figure 2C). These coupled structural changes align the catalytic residues from different regions, including the A loop, the catalytic loop, and the aC helix, to promote peptide substrate and ATP binding and to increase catalytic efficiency. In the structure, peptide substrate binds into the active site in a similar fashion as in the two published structures of A loop phosphorylated IRK (Hubbard, 1997) and IGF1R kinase (Favelyukis et al., 2001) in complex with substrate peptide. There is clear density for only a tetrapeptide region (767EEYL770) of the substrate, and the remaining nine residues of the peptide have uninterpretable density. Similarly, only six residues of the 18 residue-long substrate peptide in the IRK structure and only eight residues of the 14 residue-long substrate peptide in the IGF1RK structure have been modeled. The A loop conformation in the A loop tyrosine phosphorylated wild-type FGFR2K structure is stabilized primarily by hydrogen bonds between the phosphate group of pY657 and the side chains of R649 and K659, and between the side chain of K659 and the backbone and side-chain atoms of T661 in the A loop (Figure 2C). Moreover, pY657 and K658 form a short b strand, which pairs with b12 strand formed by residues V679 and Y680 in the linker between aEF and aF helices (Figures 2B and 2C). This extra b strand pairing provides additional stabilization of the active A loop conformation. In contrast to pY657, phosphorylated Y656 is solvent exposed and does not contribute to the activated A loop conformation (Figures 2B and 2C). The structural data are consistent with the mutagenesis data on the highly homologous FGFR1 kinase (Mohammadi et al., 1996). Mutation of Y654 (equivalent to Y657 of FGFR2) to phenylalanine abrogates the kinase activity of FGFR1 kinase, whereas mutation of Y653 (equivalent to Y656 of FGFR2) to

phenylalanine has no impact on kinase activity (Mohammadi et al., 1996). The N549H, N549T, E565G, E565A, and K641R Mutations Lead to Gain of Function by Directly Targeting a Molecular Brake at the FGFR Kinase Hinge Region In the unphosphorylated wild-type FGFR2K structure, the triad of residues E565 (in the kinase hinge), N549 (in the loop between the aC helix and the b4 strand), and K641

(in the b8 strand) interact with each other through a network of hydrogen bonds (Figure 3A and Figure S5). In the A loop tyrosine phosphorylated wild-type FGFR2K structure, concomitant with the rearrangement of the A loop and lobe closure, this network dissociates (Figure 3B and Figure S5). Therefore, we propose that this network of hydrogen bonds mediated by the triad of residues acts as a molecular brake that inhibits movement of the N lobe toward the C lobe, thereby keeping the kinase in an autoinhibited state. Based on our model, mutation of any

residue of the triad mediating the molecular brake, as found in human skeletal disorders and cancer, should disengage the brake, thereby relaxing the kinase toward its active state. To test our hypothesis, we solved the crystal structures of unphosphorylated N549H, N549T, E565G, E565A, and K641R mutant FGFR2Ks. As anticipated, analysis of the hinge region of the N549H and N549T mutant kinases reveals the loss of the hydrogen bonds between mutated residue 549 and the backbone atoms of the loop between the aC helix and the b4 strand (Figures 3C and 3D and Figure S5). This relaxes the N lobe to rotate toward the C lobe at the same pivot point, as observed in the A loop tyrosine phosphorylated wild-type FGFR2K (Figures S3A and S6 and Table S2). In the E565G, E565A, and K641R mutant structures, N549 also disengages from the backbone atoms of the aC-b4 loop and instead turns toward E565 in the kinase hinge (Figures 3E­3G and Figure S5), allowing a similar inward (toward the C lobe) motion of the N lobe in these three mutant structures (Figures S3A and S6 and Table S2). This disengagement occurs because the mutated residues in these three structures are unable to assist N549 to hydrogen bond with the backbone atoms of the aC-b4 loop. Based on these data, the hydrogen bonds between N549 and the backbone atoms of the aC-b4 loop are the most critical constituents of the molecular brake. Taken together, our data show that these five pathogenic FGFR2K mutations lead to ligand-independent kinase activation by directly disengaging the molecular brake in the hinge region. K526E Mutation Indirectly Disengages the Molecular Brake by Creating New Hydrogen Bonds between the aC Helix and the A Loop In the unphosphorylated wild-type FGFR2K structure, the side chain of K526 (located in the aC helix) engages in a hydrogen bond with D530 (data no shown). In the A loop tyrosine phosphorylated structure, the side chain of K526 disengages from D530 and becomes completely solvent exposed (data not shown). Thus, neither wildtype FGFR2K structure provides clues about the mode of action of this mutation. Analysis of our crystal structure of the unphosphorylated FGFR2 mutant kinase reveals that the aC helix mutation leads to ligand-independent kinase activation by indirectly disengaging the molecular brake at the kinase hinge region. The replacement of K526 by glutamate creates new hydrogen bonds between the mutant residue E526 and R664 in the A loop (Figure 4A). Superimposition of the C lobe of the mutant kinase onto that of the unphosphorylated wild-type kinase shows that the N lobe has rotated toward the C lobe (Figures S3A and S6 and Table S2). Analysis of the hinge region of the K526E mutant kinase shows that the side chain of N549 has disengaged from the backbone atoms of the aC-b4 loop and instead has rotated toward E565 in the hinge, indicating that the molecular brake has been loosened in this structure (Figure 4B and Figure S5). The disengagement of the molecular brake

and the inward rotation of N lobe, two hallmarks of the activated kinase, are induced indirectly by the hydrogen bonding between the mutant residue E526 and R664 in the A loop. The K659N Mutation Indirectly Disengages the Molecular Brake by Forcing the A Loop to Adopt the Active Conformation In the unphosphorylated wild-type structure, the A loop residue K659 is completely solvent exposed and does not participate in any intramolecular interactions (Figure 2C). In the A loop tyrosine phosphorylated wild-type structure, however, this residue stabilizes the active conformation of the A loop as discussed above (Figure 2C). These observations suggest that a K659N mutation might negatively impact kinase activity of FGFR2 by hampering the A loop's ability to assume an active conformation. Analysis of our unphosphorylated K659N mutant kinase structure reveals that the A loop of the mutant kinase adopts an active conformation in spite of the fact that the A loop Y657 is not phosphorylated (Figure 5A). Moreover, the superimposition of the C lobe of the K569N mutant kinase onto that of the unphosphorylated wild-type kinase also reveals that the N lobe of the mutant kinase has moved toward the C lobe (Figures S3A and S6 and Table S2). Analysis of the hinge region shows the disengagement of N549 from backbone atoms of the aC-b4 loop, indicating the loss of the molecular brake (Figure 5B and Figure S5). These local and global structural changes observed in the mutant structure are hallmarks of an activated kinase and are induced solely by the K659N mutation. The active conformation of the A loop in the K659N mutant kinase is induced by the formation of two hydrogen bonds between the side chain of the mutated residue N659 and the side chain of R625 in the catalytic loop (Figure 5A). The side chain of A loop Y657 occupies a very similar position as pY657 in the A loop tyrosine phosphorylated wild-type FGFR2K (Figure 5C). Unlike pY657 (Figure 2C), however, the hydroxyl group of Y657 forms a direct hydrogen bond with the side chain of R649, further contributing to the active conformation of the A loop (Figure 5A). In addition to a disengaged molecular brake at the hinge region, all unphosphorylated mutant kinases share yet another common feature, which is the formation of a salt bridge between D530 in the aC helix and R664 in the A loop (Figures 4A and 5A and Figure S3B). These salt bridges further contribute to the inward motion of the N lobe in all mutant kinases. Hence, our structural data reveal that the three key regulatory regions of the kinase domain (the kinase hinge, the aC helix, and the A loop) communicate with each other and act in concert to regulate tyrosine kinase activity of FGFR.

Note that this hydrogen bonding does not occur in the unphosphorylated wild-type FGFR2K structure (in wheat).

For c-Kit, an ``active'' structure of kinase domain (Mol et al., 2003) has been reported. Comparison of hinge region of the active c-Kit (Figure 6F) with that of inactive c-Kit (Figure 6E) shows that in the active c-Kit structure the three key hydrogen bonds of the molecular brake between N655 (residue equivalent to N549 of the triad in FGFR2K) and backbone atoms of the aC-b4 loop are lost. This observation is consistent with the molecular brake hypothesis and suggests that c-Kit kinase activity is also regulated by the molecular brake at the kinase hinge region. It is noteworthy that in the active c-Kit structure the A loop tyrosine (Y823) is not phosphorylated (Mol et al., 2003). Instead, the active A loop conformation of c-Kit in the structure is stabilized by a unique enzyme-substrate relationship between the two c-Kit enzymes in the asymmetric unit (Mol et al., 2003). Specifically, a phosphotyrosine residue from juxtamembrane region of the substrate-acting enzyme inserts into the active site of enzyme-acting c-Kit, stabilizing the active A loop conformation of the former enzyme. Interestingly, in the active c-Kit structure the unphosphorylated Y823 directly hydrogen bonds with R815 (Mol et al., 2003). This hydrogen bonding is equivalent to that between Y657 and R649 observed in our K659N mutant structure and may also contribute to the active A loop conformation in the active c-Kit structure. Our molecular brake hypothesis is further supported by the fact that pathogenic mutations at the N540 codon of FGFR3, N546 codon of FGFR1, and N659 codon of PDGFRa, which are homologous to the N549 codon of FGFR2, result in gain of function in human skeletal disorders (Webster and Donoghue, 1997) and cancer (Corless et al., 2005; Rand et al., 2005). Based on our structural

data, the N549K mutations in FGFR2, the N540K/T/S mutations in FGFR3, N546K mutation in FGFR1, and N659K mutation in PDGFRa should disengage these residues from the backbone atoms of the aC-b4 loop, loosen the molecular brake, and cause gain of function in FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR1, and PDGFRa in endometrial cancer, HCH, glioblastoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, respectively. Moreover, the pathogenic mutation of K659E of FGFR2 and the pathogenic mutations of K650Q/N/M/E of FGFR3, corresponding to K659 of FGFR2, also should lead to receptor hyperactivation in human skeletal disorders (Bellus et al., 2000) and cancer (Cappellen et al., 1999; Chesi et al., 1997; Pollock et al., 2007; Richelda et al., 1997) by driving the A loop to an active conformation and indirectly disengaging the brake at the kinase hinge region. Intriguingly, analysis of the kinase hinge region in the inhibited PAK1 (Lei et al., 2000), a serine/threonine kinase, also reveals the presence of a similar molecular brake as in FGFRs (data not shown). This molecular brake is disengaged in the activated PAK1 structure (Lei et al., 2005) (data not shown). These observations suggest that autoinhibition by molecular brake may also be applicable to PAKs and possibly other serine/threonine kinases.

Conclusion In this study, we provided the structural basis for FGFR2 kinase activation by phosphorylation of the A loop tyrosine and the molecular basis by which seven different mutations in the kinase domain lead to pathogenic ligand-independent activation of FGFR2 in human skeletal disorders. The ensemble of nine crystal structures disclosed an autoinhibitory mechanism in the regulation of FGFR kinases and many other RTKs. This autoinhibition is regulated by a molecular brake mediated by a triad of residues in the kinase hinge region. Pathogenic mutations disengage this molecular brake either directly or indirectly to promote

To assist the readers, the whole unphosphorylated K659E mutant FGFR2K structure is also shown in cartoon and solid semitransparent surface, and the kinase hinge region is boxed. Coloring scheme is as in Figure 3. (C) The K659N mutation drives the A loop to adopt its active conformation in the absence of A loop tyrosine phosphorylation.

more readily ligand-independent autophosphorylation and activation. To our knowledge, the structure of A loop tyrosine phosphorylated FGFR2K presented here is the first example of an A loop phosphorylated activated RTK structure outside of the insulin receptor subfamily. Superimposition of the C lobe of the A loop tyrosine phosphorylated FGFR2K onto those of the A loop tyrosine phosphorylated IRK (Hubbard, 1997) and IGF1RK (Favelyukis et al., 2001) reveals that the A loops of all these activated kinases adopt a very similar conformation (Figure 2D). Therefore, our data demonstrate that although the A loops of different RTKs adopt different conformations in the unphosphorylated state, they all assume a common conformation in the phosphorylated activated state. Superimposition of the b strands of N lobe between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated FGFR2K shows that the aC helix in FGFR2 kinase does not shift independently of the other secondary structure elements of N lobe (Figure S2B). This is evidenced by that fact that the key salt bridge between K517 in the b3 strand and E534 in the aC helix is already present in the

unphosphorylated wild-type FGFR2K structure (Figure S2C). Hence, FGFR2K contrasts with the Cdks, Src family kinases, and insulin/IGF receptor kinases whose ° aC helix can shift by as much as 10 A relative to other N lobe secondary structures upon activation. The ensemble of our structural data provide much sought after snapshots of dynamics of RTK regulation by the three key regulatory regions of the kinase domain (the kinase hinge, the aC helix, and the A loop). The FGFR2K pathogenic mutations in the kinase hinge region disengage the molecular brake directly, whereas mutations in the aC helix and the A loop disengage it indirectly through long-range allosteric communication as depicted by the K659N mutant structure. The activating effect of the K659N mutation is relayed to the hinge region through a series of coupled intramolecular events consisting of reconfiguration of the A loop to its active state, introduction of new set of interaction between the aC helix and the A loop, and dissociation of the molecular brake. Taken together, these pathogenic mutations highlight the trajectory of a communication pathway between the A loop, the

aC helix, and the kinase hinge and underscore that the three key regulatory regions of the kinase domain act in concert to regulate tyrosine kinase activity of RTKs (Figure 7). We suggest that the unphosphorylated tyrosine kinase samples dynamically a spectrum of conformations. One end of the spectrum is populated by fully inhibited kinases with tightened molecular brake and the A loop in the inactive conformation (represented by the unphosphorylated wild-type FGFR2K structure). The other end of the spectrum is populated by kinases with a completely released molecular brake and the A loop in the active conformation (depicted by the unphosphorylated K659N mutant structure). The latter state is ``quasi-stable'' in the absence of A loop tyrosine phosphorylation, and the

molecular brake at the kinase hinge region dominates, ``swinging back'' the kinase to its inhibited state. This idea is supported by the fact that RTKs exhibit a low level of basal tyrosine kinase activity in the absence of their ligands. Ligand binding and subsequent receptor dimerization increase the local concentration of the receptors at different autoinhibitory states, providing the few receptors in quasi-stable state with sufficient opportunity to transphosphorylate each other on the A loop, holding them in the fully activated state (depicted by the A loop tyrosine phosphorylated wild-type structure). The pathogenic mutations in the kinase hinge, the aC helix, and the A loop activate the kinases by loosening the molecular brake, thereby shifting the equilibrium toward the activated state.

The locations of mutated residues (labeled in black) are mapped onto the crystal structures of unphosphorylated (A) and phosphorylated (B) wild-type FGFR2 kinase. D650V and M670T mutations (residue location labeled in purple) also activate FGFR2K (H.C. and M.M., unpublished data). D650V corresponds to the recurrent activating mutations D842V in PDGFRa, D816V in KIT, and D835V in FLT3. M670T corresponds to the activating mutation of M918T in RET. The double-headed arrows denote the reciprocal direction of communication between the A loop, the aC helix, and the kinase hinge.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization Wild-type and nine mutant FGFR2 kinase domains each harboring a distinct pathogenic mutation (K526E, N549H, N549T, E565G, E565A, K641R, K659N, G663E, and R678G) were expressed with an N-terminal 63His tag to aid in protein purification. The N- and C-terminal boundaries of the expressed FGFR2 kinase domain are P458 and E768, respectively. These boundaries were chosen based on the crystal structure of the unphosphorylated wild-type FGFR1 kinase domain (Mohammadi et al., 1996). The wild-type and mutant kinases were purified by sequential Ni2+-chelating, anion-exchange, and sizeexclusion chromatography. The purity of the proteins was estimated to be over 98% based on SDS-PAGE analysis. Traces of phosphorylation on wild-type and mutant kinases were removed by treating the proteins with alkaline phosphatase, and MALDI Q-TOF mass spectrometry was used to confirm that all purified kinases were not phosphorylated on the A loop tyrosines. As examples, data for unphosphorylated wild-type and N549H and R678G mutant FGFR2Ks are shown in Figures S4A­S4C. To generate A loop tyrosine phosphorylated wild-type kinase, the purified wild-type FGFR2 kinase was mixed with 10 mM ATP and 5 mM MgCl2, and the completion of tyrosine autophosphorylation was monitored by native PAGE analysis. Phosphorylated wild-type kinase was then separated from excess of ATP on a size-exclusion column, followed by anion-exchange chromatography to yield wild-type kinase that was homogenously phosphorylated on both Y656 and Y657 in the A loop. The phosphorylation was confirmed by positive and negative mode MALDI Q-TOF mass spectrometry (Figures S4D and S4E) after methyl esterification of tryptic peptides to improve detection of phosphopeptides (Xu et al., 2005). Wild-type (either unphosphorylated and A loop tyrosine phosphory-

lated) and unphosphorylated mutant FGFR2K proteins were concentrated to about 10­100 mg/ml with Centricon-10. Prior to crystallization, the phosphorylated wild-type kinase was mixed with peptide substrate, ATP-analog (AMP-PCP), and MgCl2 at a molar ratio of 1:1:3:15. The peptide substrate (15 amino acids long) is derived from the C-terminal tail of FGFR2 (residues 764­778) (Figure S1) and contains Y769, one of the major autophosphorylation sites of FGFR2. Crystals of wild-type (either unphosphorylated and A loop tyrosine phosphorylated) and unphosphorylated mutant kinases were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 20 C using crystallization buffer composed of 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), PEG4000 (15%­20%), and NH4SO3 (0.2­0.3 M). MALDI Q-TOF MS/MS analysis of the dissolved crystals showed stoichiometrical phosphorylation on Y657 and heterogeneous phosphorylation on Y656 (Figures S4F and S4G). Mass spectrometry analysis also showed heterogeneous phosphorylation on Y586 in the kinase insert (data not shown). Importantly, the mass spectrometry data are consistent with the structure, which shows that phosphorylation on Y657 is indispensable in stabilizing the active conformation of the A loop. Phosphorylated Y656 is solvent exposed and does not contribute to the activated A loop conformation. Data Collection and Structure Determination Diffraction data were collected on single cryo-cooled crystals at beamlines X-4A and X-4C at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Crystals were stabilized in mother liquor by stepwise increasing glycerol concentration to 20% and then flash-frozen in dry nitrogen stream. All diffraction data were processed with HKL2000 Suite (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Molecular replacement solutions were found for unphosphorylated wild-type FGFR2K with unphosphorylated wild-type FGFR1K as the search model using the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). Subsequently, the

unphosphorylated wild-type FGFR2K structure was used as the search model for A loop tyrosine phosphorylated wild-type and unphosphorylated mutant FGFR2 kinases. Rigid-body refinements of wild-type (either unphosphorylated or A loop tyrosine phosphorylated) and unphosphorylated mutant kinases were performed with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) by treating the N lobe and C lobe of the kinases as two separate entities. Model building was carried out with O (Jones et al., 1991), and iterative positional and B factor refinements were done with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). All refined structures display good geometry and Ramachandran statistics. Data collection and structure refinement statistic with PDB IDs of reported structures are listed in Table 1. Atomic superimpositions and calculations of lobe rotations were performed with the program lsqkab (Kabsch, 1976) in CCP4 Suite (CCP4, 1994), and structural representations were prepared with PyMOL (DeLano, 2002). The Difference Distance Matrix Plot (DDMP) was used to compare conformational changes between wild-type and mutant kinases (P.J. Fleming, http://roselab.jhu.edu/ ddmp/).

Kinase Assays A continuous spectrophotometric assay (Barker et al., 1995) was used to measure the kinase activity of FGFR2K. The assays were carried out at 30 C in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.28 mM NADH, 89 U/ml pyruvate kinase, and 124 U/ml lactate dehydrogenase, in a total volume of 50 ml. Assays of FGFR2K autophosphorylation were carried out with 1 mM enzyme and 1 mM ATP. For FGFR2 peptide substrate phosphorylation assays, 1 mM enzyme, 100 mM ATP, and 50 mM peptide substrate (KKEEE EYMMMM) were used. To test the effect of A loop phosphorylation on kinase activity of wild-type and mutant kinases, assays of FGFR2K peptide substrate phosphorylation were carried out with 1 mM enzyme, 500 mM ATP, and 500 mM peptide substrate (KKEEEEYMMMM). For determinations of Km, ATP, reactions contained a peptide concentration of 2 mM and ATP at varying concentrations of 10­4000 mM. For determinations of Km, peptide, reactions contained an ATP concentration of 1 mM and peptide substrate at varying concentrations of 10­2500 mM. Data were recorded every 6 s. The kinetic parameters were determined by fitting initial rate data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Phosphorylation of the STAT1 peptide was measured by the phosphocellulose binding assay (Casnellie, 1991) under similar conditions.
