metric equivalents of ATP are added. This shows the cooperativity of ATP binding. This is evidence that ligand binding can be observed within the complex, without dissociation, even when the transmembrane subunits are stripped. We have shown that we can maintain the seemingly unfavorable hydrophobic interactions within a heteromeric membrane protein complex by encapsulating it in a solution-phase detergent micelle and transferring this protected complex into the gas phase. Although the formation of micelles in solution has been shown to be facilitated by evaporation (9, 33) and could be considered akin to the early stages of electrospray (7), the overall structure of gas-phase detergent assemblies is difficult to establish. Previous studies have shown preservation of micellar structure and protein encapsulation within reverse micelles (12). However, the fact that we have been able to employ mass spectrometry acceleration conditions far in excess of those used previously to preserve noncovalent complexes (23) implicates the stabilizing effects of the gas-phase detergent assembly regardless of its structure. Consequently, this enables us to release the complex intact and with ligand binding maintained. The observation that BtuD subunits are released preferentially, when large numbers of detergent molecules are present, while dissociated BtuC subunits predominate in their absence, is further evidence of the protection of the transmembrane subunits within gas-phase detergent assemblies. The low dielectric interior of lipid bilayers, which closely mimics the vacuum conditions of a mass spectrometer, may also contribute to the stability of the membrane complex once it is released from the gas-phase detergent assembly (34). It is established that solution-phase micelles exert pressure (35) sufficient to maintain the packing of the BtuC helices and subunit interfaces. We speculate that a similar effect may also be operative here, enabling us to preserve the deleterious effects of the phase transfer and to retain hydrophobic interactions between the transmembrane subunit interfaces. Irrespective of the origin of this unexpected gas-phase stability, and given the long-standing difficulties encountered in studying membrane protein complexes by mass spectrometry, as well as the ambiguities experienced in determining the stoichiometry of subunits within micelles using classical approaches, this represents a substantial advance, not only in methodology but also for assessing the effects of small-molecule drug candidates. More generally, the ability to release membrane protein complexes from detergent aggregates in the gas phase, devoid of detergent and with ligand binding intact, has great potential, not only for structural genomics but also for the many imaging techniques that are rapidly coming to the fore (36).

Structural Basis of Trans-Inhibition in a Molybdate/Tungstate ABC Transporter
Sabina Gerber,* Mireia Comellas-Bigler,* Birke A. Goetz, Kaspar P. Locher Transport across cellular membranes is an essential process that is catalyzed by diverse membrane transport proteins. The turnover rates of certain transporters are inhibited by their substrates in a process termed trans-inhibition, whose structural basis is poorly understood. We present the crystal structure of a molybdate/tungstate ABC transporter (ModBC) from Methanosarcina acetivorans in a trans-inhibited state. The regulatory domains of the nucleotide-binding subunits are in close contact and provide two oxyanion binding pockets at the shared interface. By specifically binding to these pockets, molybdate or tungstate prevent adenosine triphosphatase activity and lock the transporter in an inward-facing conformation, with the catalytic motifs of the nucleotide-binding domains separated. This allosteric effect prevents the transporter from switching between the inward-facing and the outward-facing states, thus interfering with the alternating access and release mechanism.

ctive transport proteins consume cellular energy to move substrates across biological membranes against their (electro)chemical gradients. Transport processes are regulated at various stages; this includes genetic regulation of the expression levels or control of the transporters by inhibitory cellular signals. Another mechanism is trans-inhibition, which occurs when substrates exert a concentrationdependent, inhibitory effect on the transporter after the translocation has occurred, that is, on the VOL 321 SCIENCE

target side (trans side) of the membrane (1). This type of inhibition results in the decrease of the transport rates as the concentration of substrate increases (2). It is therefore a functional equivalent to product inhibition of soluble enzymes. Trans-inhibition has been reported for ion transporters (3) and various amino acid transporters (4­8), including glutamate transporters in astrocytes (9). It has also been described for binding protein­dependent ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as those specific for

methionine [met system in Escherichia coli (10)], glycine/betaine [OpuA from Lactobacillus plantarum or Listeria monocytogenes (11, 12)], or spermidine/putrescine [ pot system in E. coli (13)]. Even though the functional effect of transinhibition has been known for a long time, its structural basis is not well understood. We have studied Methanosarcina acetivorans ModBC (MaModBC), a binding protein­dependent ABC transporter specific for molybdate/tungstate. It consists of two transmembrane domains (TMDs, ModB subunits) that form a translocation pathway for the substrate, and two cytoplasmic nucleotidebinding domains (NBDs, ModC subunits) that bind and hydrolyze adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and power the transport reaction. What distinguishes MaModBC from other ABC importers such as the B12 transporter BtuCD (14, 15) or the molybdate/tungstate transporter ModBC from Archaeoglobus fulgidus [AfModBC (16)] is the presence of a regulatory domain appended to the C terminus of the NBDs. This domain has some 120 amino acid residues, and similar extensions have been found in other ABC importers such as the methionine importer. Even though these domains had been suspected to be involved in regulation, their exact function has been somewhat of a mystery in most cases (17). While investigating its adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, we found that binding of molybdate or tungstate had an inhibitory effect on the ATP hydrolysis rate of the intact transporter MaModBC (Fig. 1A). The ATPase rate of MaModBC was already inhibited at low micromolar concentrations of molybdate (or tungstate), with an apparent inhibitory constant of ~5 mM. By contrast, the ATPase activity of AfModBC, which does not contain regulatory domains appended to the NBDs, was insensitive even to high concentrations of molybdate or tungstate (Table 1). Because ATP hydrolysis is a strict requirement for transport in ABC transporters, these results suggested that the regulatory domains present in MaModBC, but absent in AfModBC, mediate trans-inhibition. We then proceeded to determine the crystal structure of the complete MaModBC transporter in a trans-inhibited conformation after cocrystallization with bound tungstate. We found that the regulatory domains form two oxyanion binding pockets that bind the substrate and lock the transporter in an inward-facing conformation, with the catalytic motifs of the NBDs separated. The structure of tungstate-bound MaModBC was determined with experimental phases from a three-wavelength MAD (multiwavelength anomalous dispersion) data set collected around the tungsten edge (18). The diffraction data (fig. S1 and table S1) were anisotropic and were truncated to 3.0, 3.3, and 3.5 Å

resolution in the three diffraction directions (19). Because of the high accuracy of the MAD phases, which were further improved by solvent flattening and noncrystallographic symmetry averaging, the experimental electron density was of excellent quality (fig. S2) and allowed unambiguous building of the entire protein structure. The TMDs and NBDs of MaModBC have folds similar to those of the previously determined AfModBC (16). However, the conformations of MaModBC and AfModBC are quite different. Whereas the NBDs of AfModBC have a shared interface, those of MaModBC contact each other exclusively through their regulatory domains. The catalytic (RecA-like and helical) subdomains of MaModBC have no direct contacts (fig. S3). Although separated, these domains nonetheless exhibit a "head-to-tail" arrangement, with the conserved P-loops juxtaposed to the LSGGQ motifs of the opposite subunit. Yet the distance between these conserved motifs increases from ~10 Å in AfModBC to ~23 Å in MaModBC, leaving a large gap between the NBDs in the latter. The separation is even more pronounced than that previously observed in the "open" conformation of the nucleotide-free NBD of the maltose transporter MalK (20). The regulatory domains of MaModBC bind two tungstate ions at their shared interface, with both subunits contributing to both tungstate binding pockets. This is reminiscent of how ATP is bound between the NBDs of ABC transporters, where two ATP binding sites exist at the shared interface of opposite NBDs, with each domain contributing to both binding sites. Each regulatory domain contains two similar and consecutive subdomains that feature "Greek key" motifs. Similar folds have been observed for other molybdate-binding proteins, among them the Cterminal domain of the molybdate-dependent

transcription regulator ModE (21). In the presence of molybdate, homodimeric ModE changes its conformation to form a tight, molybdate-bound interface (22), whereupon its N-terminal DNA binding domain acts as a repressor of the molybdate transporter and as an enhancer of molybdenumdependent enzymes (23). The regulatory domains of MaModC (residues 231 to 348) and E. coli ModE (residues 124 to 262) are structurally similar (Fig. 2, A and B), with an overall root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 2.1 Å. However, a circular permutation places the two Greek key motifs in an opposite order, with the N and C termini of the ModE domain located at the linker between the Greek key motifs of MaModC (fig. S4). Two oxyanions are bound at the shared interface in both proteins (Fig. 2B), and the location of the binding sites, as well as the specific amino acid side chains mediating contacts (mostly hydrogen bonds) to the oxyanions, are conserved (Fig. 2C). The similarity in sequence and structure extends to proteins involved in molybdate storage and homeostasis, including the Mop protein from Sporomusa ovata [RMSD = 2.3 Å (24)] and ModG from Azotobacter vinelandii [RMSD = 1.3 Å (25)]. The architectural similarity of the regulatory domains of ModE and MaModC creates an unexpected structural link between genetic regulation and trans-inhibition in ABC transporters. In both processes, tight dimers of regulatory domains with two oxyanions (molybdate or tungstate) sandwiched at the shared interface affect the function of the fused partner domains. ModE exploits this to promote the binding of its Nterminal domains to DNA (23), whereas in the ABC transporter MaModBC, binding of molybdate keeps the catalytic motifs of the NBDs separated, thus disrupting the ATP hydrolysis cycle. Elevated concentrations of free cytoplasmic mo-

lybdate will thus lead to an inhibition of the transport activity (and hence to a decrease in molybdate uptake) through both processes. However, not all bacteria contain ModE, and in particular, there does not seem to be a homolog in the genome of M. acetivorans. This may indicate that transinhibition can substitute for the genetic regulation of the molybdate transporter. Many other organisms such as E. coli, Photorhabdus luminescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae do contain genes coding for ModE and at the same time feature regulatory domains attached to their ModC subunits (fig. S5), which suggests that molybdate import in these organisms may be regulated both by transinhibition and by genetic control of the expression levels. Another ABC transporter, the maltose importer MalFGK from E. coli (26), also contains a regulatory domain with a similar fold. However, maltose has not been reported to bind to MalK, nor does it seem to affect the ATPase activity of Table 1.

the isolated NBDs or the full maltose transporter. Instead, the regulatory domains of MalK have been reported to interact with the transcriptional activator MalT (27) and with the enzyme IIA component of the glucose phosphotransferase system (28). The arrangement of the two regulatory domains of MalK in the crystal structures is distinct from what we observe in MaModBC, and an arrangement similar to that in MaModBC is precluded by a C-terminal extension of 15 amino acid residues in MalK that would cause a steric clash (fig. S4). This difference in arrangement may explain why the activity of MalK is not trans-inhibited by elevated levels of maltose. Because ATPase activity is a strict requirement for transport in ABC transporters, the inhibition of the ATPase activity of MaModBC by molybdate or tungstate will result in inhibited transport activity. To demonstrate that the inhibitory effect was specific, we identified four conserved residues in MaModBC (Ser286, Thr320, Ser323, and Lys340; Fig. 2C) that serve as hydrogen bond donors in the oxyanion binding pockets. We individually mutated these residues to alanines (except for Thr320, which was mutated to the isoelectronic valine) and tested the sensitivity of the ATPase activity of the resulting mutants to molybdate (Fig. 3). The mutants revealed ATPase activities similar to that of the wild type, but the sensitivity of the hydrolysis rates to molybdate was strongly reduced in two mutants (Ser323  Ala and Thr320  Val) and abolished in the

others (Ser286  Ala and Lys340  Ala). A control mutation (Ser342  Ala) of a nonconserved serine residue that is in the vicinity of, but does not provide a hydrogen bond to, the oxyanion, did not have any effect on the inhibitory concentration (Fig. 3). Combined, our functional data demonstrate that molybdate or tungstate binding to the oxyanion pocket at the interface of the regulatory domains allosterically inhibit the ATPase activity, and hence the reaction cycle, of MaModBC. The transmembrane domains of AfModBC, MaModBC, and MalFGK have similar folds and TM topologies but reveal differences in conformation (Fig. 4A). Whereas MaModBC and AfModBC reveal nucleotide-free, inward-facing conformations, MalFGK is ATP-bound and outward-facing. The two ModBC structures differ in that the trans-inhibited MaModBC reveals increased angles of the two TMDs in a more pronounced inward-facing conformation, which is reflected in a larger distance of the coupling helices relative to AfModBC (Fig. 4A). On the basis of the crystal structures of full ABC transporters, we have previously proposed a conserved coupling mechanism for ABC transporters (16, 29), which is an adaptation of Jardetzky's alternating access and release mechanism (30) and also agrees with other mechanistic models (31). The basic two-state schematic suggests that the TMD-formed translocation pathways of ABC transporters adopt an inward-facing conformation when the NBDs are nucleotide-free, and an

REPORTS

outward-facing conformation when the NBDs form a head-to-tail sandwich with tightly bound ATP. If correct, this scheme predicts that the different conformations of the TMDs may be converted into one another, and then trapped using chemical cross-linking, depending on whether ATP is bound to the NBDs. We have thus engineered cysteines into AfModB (the TMD) at the cytoplasmic end of TM 4 at positions that are very close in the structure of MalFGK, but far apart in both ModBC structures (Fig. 4A). The engineered cysteines had no effect on the stability and ATPase activity of AfModBC, which suggests that the mutation had not induced any conformational change in the protein. The cysteines were subsequently reacted with copper, which can promote disulfide formation; this technique was introduced for membrane proteins during studies of the conformational changes in the aspartate receptor (32). In contrast to longer chemical cross-linkers, the use of Cu as a catalyst requires the cysteine side chains to be in the immediate vicinity and in an optimal geometrical arrangement for successful disulfide formation. One of our AfModBC mutants (Ser153  Cys) revealed pronounced crosslinking that was dependent on the addition of ATP (Fig. 4B), as evidenced by the increase of a dimeric ModB band and the simultaneous decrease of the monomeric ModB band. The efficiency of the cross-linking was estimated to be above 50%, as assessed from the band intensities of several SDS gels. Such an efficiency is remarkable given the stringent requirements on geometry and the competition of the cross-linking reaction with air oxidation of the cysteines. The results suggest that the TMDs of AfModBC can adopt a conformation similar to that of MalFGK only when ATP is bound to the NBDs. This demonstrates that binding of ATP to the NBDs is

Cross-linking was performed by CuCl2 in detergent solution, with or without ATP and o-vanadate (VO4). No Cu was added to the control reaction. Protein markers are shown in the left lane, with molecular masses indicated. coupled to a conformational change in the TMDs, forcing the cytoplasmic TM helices together and likely converting the entire translocation pathway into an outward-facing conformation. Similar experiments with MaModBC were not successful, possibly because the relative arrangement of the introduced cysteines is not as favorable for efficient disulfide formation or because air oxidation of the cysteines was faster than the cross-linking reaction. Our results nonetheless demonstrate that in the ATP-bound state, the cytoplasmic ends of the transmembrane helices of molybdate ABC transporters approach each other and adopt a conformation similar to the outward-facing state of the maltose transporter. Our cross-linking data lend further biochemical support to the above-mentioned two-state model of the mechanism of ABC transporters (29), which is in agreement with several ABC transporter structures that have been determined in recent years (33, 34). The structure of MaModBC we describe here fits this two-state scenario but adds an important new element. Even though we do not know how the absence of bound molybdate or tungstate will affect the conformation of MaModBC, it will likely remain inwardfacing in the absence of nucleotide and will only adopt an outward-facing conformation, similar to that observed in the maltose transporter intermediate, upon binding of ATP. The trans-inhibited MaModBC structure demonstrates that regulatory domains can keep the catalytic domains of SCIENCE VOL 321 the NBDs apart, thereby preventing efficient ATP hydrolysis. Because the NBDs are connected to the TMDs via the coupling helices, the cytoplasmic parts of the TMDs are spread apart as well, which locks the transporter in an inwardfacing conformation and prevents the ATPtriggered switch to the outward-facing state. Thus, high cytoplasmic concentrations of free substrate can prevent the transporter from cycling through the alternating access and release mechanism. Even though the details of substrate binding may differ in other families of transporters, it is likely that trans-inhibition in such proteins is based on similar effects.

The High-Affinity E. coli Methionine ABC Transporter: Structure and Allosteric Regulation
Neena S. Kadaba, Jens T. Kaiser, Eric Johnson, Allen Lee, Douglas C. Rees* The crystal structure of the high-affinity Escherichia coli MetNI methionine uptake transporter, a member of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)­binding cassette (ABC) family, has been solved to 3.7 angstrom resolution. The overall architecture of MetNI reveals two copies of the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) MetN in complex with two copies of the transmembrane domain MetI, with the transporter adopting an inward-facing conformation exhibiting widely separated nucleotide binding domains. Each MetI subunit is organized around a core of five transmembrane helices that correspond to a subset of the helices observed in the larger membrane-spanning subunits of the molybdate (ModBC) and maltose (MalFGK) ABC transporters. In addition to the conserved nucleotide binding domain of the ABC family, MetN contains a carboxyl-terminal extension with a ferredoxin-like fold previously assigned to a conserved family of regulatory ligand-binding domains. These domains separate the nucleotide binding domains and would interfere with their association required for ATP binding and hydrolysis. Methionine binds to the dimerized carboxyl-terminal domain and is shown to inhibit ATPase activity. These observations are consistent with an allosteric regulatory mechanism operating at the level of transport activity, where increased intracellular levels of the transported ligand stabilize an inward-facing, ATPase-inactive state of MetNI to inhibit further ligand translocation into the cell.

T

he high-affinity uptake of methionine by Escherichia coli is mediated by the MetD system (1, 2), a member of the methionine uptake transporter family (3) of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)­binding cassette (ABC) transporters (4­8). ABC transporters such as MetD translocate substrates across the membrane, a process that is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP by a cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domain (NBD). Architecturally, an ABC transporter contains four domains: two NBDs responsible for the interactions with ATP and two transmembrane domains (TMDs) that form the translocation pathway; the NBD and TMD components of the

E. coli MetD system have been identified as MetN and MetI, respectively (9, 10). Substrate translocation by ABC transporters may be described in terms of an alternating access model that involves the interconversion of outward- and inward-facing conformations driven by the binding and hydrolysis of ATP by the NBDs. Additional domains of diverse structure may be fused to the TMDs or NBDs to regulate transport activity (11); examples include ionic strength sensing by OpuA (12), the inducer exclusion phenomenon mediated by MalK (13), and posttranslational modifications of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (14). Structural studies of the intact ABC importers for vitamin B12 (BtuCD) (15, 16) and the homologous HI1470/71 (17), molybdate (ModBC) (18) and maltose (MalFGK) (19), and the exporters Sav1866 (20) and MsbA (21) have established the basic molecular architecture of ABC transVOL 321 SCIENCE

porters and provided structural models for some of the states of the transport cycle. The MetD system was originally identified as an importer of both L- and D-methionine, either of which may be used as a source of methionine by E. coli (2, 22). MetD is additionally capable of transporting L-selenomethionine and other methionine derivatives. Early studies by Kadner (23) established the phenomenon of trans-inhibition in this system, whereby uptake of external methionine is inhibited by intracellular methionine levels in a fashion consistent with the direct action of methionine on the transporter. To further investigate this system, we have determined the crystal structure at 3.7 Å resolution of the E. coli methionine ABC transporter MetNI solubilized in the detergent dodecylmaltoside (24). Together with kinetic studies, the crystallographic analyses indicate that the binding of methionine to the C-terminal domain of the ABC subunits stabilizes an inward-facing, adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)­inactive conformation of the transporter. Furthermore, these analyses provide a structural basis for the regulatory properties discovered by Kadner. The overall architecture of MetNI consists of two copies of the ATPase MetN in complex with two copies of the TMD MetI, with the transporter adopting an inward-facing conformation having the TMDs open to the cytoplasm and the NBDs widely separated (Fig. 1). The folds of MetN and MetI resemble those previously observed in the ModBC (18) and MalFGK (19) transporters, with three principal differences: (i) The TMD of the methionine transporter is smaller, as each MetI subunit contains only five transmembrane helices per monomer. (ii) The structures of the methionine, molybdate, and maltose transporters represent a progression of inward-facing conformations of the translocation pathway that vary from wide open to closed, respectively. (iii) The MetN ABC subunits contain a C-terminal extension that is distinct from those present in the maltose and molybdate transporters and that separates the NBDs in this inward-facing conformation.
