Abstract-The complex formulated as [Cu(bpc)(H,O),] (bpc = 2,2-bipyridyl-3,3'-dicarboxylate) has been prepared. A single crystal structure revealed that it consists of polymeric chains of [Cu(bpc)(H,O),] units, Each copper(I1) ion pair is bridged by a bpc dianion in a tridentate fashion through its two pyridine nitrogen atoms and one carboxylate oxygen atom. Each copper(I1) ion has a distorted square-pyramidal environment : the equatorial positions are occupied by two nitrogen atoms of a bpc ligand and an oxygen atom of another bpc ligand and an oxygen atom of a water molecule, and the apical position by an oxygen atom of another water molecule. The three non-coordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms of the bpc ligand are all hydrogen-bonded with a coordinated water molecule. The IR spectra are discussed with the structure. The magnetic susceptibility has been measured in the range 7-300 K and obeys the Curie-Weiss law l/xm = C(T- 0) with 0 = - 1.24 K, suggesting a very weak antiferromagnetic interaction between the copper(I1) ions.

The study of multi-atom bridged polynuclear metal complexes has been an important subject for understanding the mechanism of spin coupling between the paramagnetic metal ions,`*2 providing insight into the pathways of electron transfer in biological electron-transport chains3 and mimicking polynuclear biologically active centres.4 Recent active research for molecular ferromagnets gives this field a strong impu1se.5~6 our knowledge, no bpc (2,2'To bipyridyl-3,3'-dicarboxylate) bridged metal polynuclear complex has been reported so far, although the bpc ion is a possible bridging ligand in view of its chemical structure. We are interested in the bridging mode and the ability to propagate magnetic exchange coupling. In this study, a bpc

bridged copper(I1) polymeric chain complex formulated as [Cu(bpc)(H,O),] has been synthesized and the X-ray structure, IR spectra and magnetic properties have been investigated. EXPERIMENTAL

Elemental analyses were obtained at the Analysis and Measurement Centre of Nanjing University. The IR spectra were recorded in the 4000-400 cm-' region using KBr pellets on a Nicolet 170 SX FTIR spectrometer. Magnetic susceptibilities were measured in the temperature range 7-90 K by the use of a vibrating sample magnetometer Model CFI and in the range 8&300 K by the use of a Faraday balance. The apparatus was calibrated with [Ni(en),[S,O,]] (en = ethylenediamine)' and correction for diamagnetism of the component atoms was made by the use of Pascal's constants.g
X-ray structure determination

The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques with anisotropic thermal factors for all non-hydrogen atoms. The positions of the hydrogen atoms were calculated with the riding model. Atomic scattering factors were taken from ref. 10. All the calculations were carried out using the Siemens SHELXTLPlaus-Plus system of computer programs. The final values of R = 0.0435 and Rw = 0.0529 were obtained. Tables of atomic coordinates, thermal parameters, bond lengths and angles and F,F, data have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Description of the structure

Single crystal data were collected on a Siemens R3m/V diffractometer with graphite monochromated MO-K, (1 = 0.71073 A) radiation at room temperature. A green plate-like crystal was used with the dimensions 0.30 x0.25 x0.10 mm. The scan mode was 0-20.2724 independent reflections were collected in the range 3 < 28 < 55, 2198 of which with F > 5 o(F) were used for further computation. Crystal data.

The geometry of an individual copper atom is shown in Fig. 1. Selected bond distances and angles are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2, the crystal consists of polymeric chains of structure [Cu(bpc)(H,O),] units. Copper(I1) ions are connected together by a single bpc bridge in a tridentate fashion through its two pyridine nitrogen atoms on one side and a carboxylate oxygen atom on another side. That is, the bpc dianion is in a syn conformation. The nearest intrachain coppercopper distance is 4.437 A. Based on the bond angles and lengths, the structure around copper could be regarded as a distorted square-based pyramid. The equatorial plane includes the two nitrogens N(1) and N(2) of one bpc ligand, the 0( 1) atom of another bpc ligand in the same chain and the Ow(2) atom of a water molecule. The apical position is occupied by the

Ow( 1) atom of another water molecule. The largest deviation of N(l), N(2), Ow(2), O(1) with regard to their mean plane is 0.15 A. Each copper atom is displaced towards the apical side by 0.21 A. The Cu-N bond distances 2.040 and 2.015 8, are in good agreement with those found in copper(I1) bipyridine complexes." The Cu-O( 1) length 1.945 8, is also comparable with other carboxylate copper(I1) complexes.`2 Only one carboxylato group of bpc joins in the coordination in a unidentate fashion. The three non-coordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms [0(2),0(3),0(4)] are all hydrogen-bonded with

coordinated water molecules (see Table 1 and Fig. 3). The HUH. . . 0 contacts are about 2.7 A, indicating the hydrogen bonds are of medium strength.13 The dihedral angle between the two pyridine ring planes I [N(l),C(l),C(2),C(3),C(4),C(5)] and II [N(2),C(6),C(7),C(QC(9),C(lO)] is 28.7". C(2) and C(7) are coplanar with their connecting carboxylato groups, respectively. The dihedral angle between the two mean planes III [C(2), C(12), O(4), O(3)] and IV [C(7), C(lla), O(la), 0(2a)] containing carboxylato groups is 8.8". The dihedral angles of I-III and II-IV are 48.4 and 48.7" respec-

tively. It is clear that bpc acts as a non-planar chelating ligand in this complex.
IR spectra and magnetic properties

In the IR spectra, there are at least four bands in the 2900-3500 cm-' region. The sharp band at 3083 cm-' may be assigned to the C-H stretching vibration of the pyridine ring. The other bands (3401, 3209, 2934 cm-`) particularly the lowest wave number band, are broad and they must be attributed to the H-O-H stretching vibrations of the water molecule. Such a result indicates the existence of a hydrogen-bonding interaction.14 This is in accordance with the result of the X-ray structure. Four characteristic strong bands (1645, 1574,1378, 1347 cm-`) suggest the existence of different types of carboxylato groups. It is recognized that unidentate coordination of the carboxylate ion should increase the v,,,,(COO) and decrease the v,,,(COO) so that the separation between the v(CO0) frequencies is larger than that for the free carboxylate ion." Therefore, the 1645 and 1347 cm-' vibrations may be assigned to the v,,,,(COO) and v,,,(COO) of the coordinated carboxylato group, respectively. The 1574 and 1378 cm-' vibrations may be due to the v,,,,(COO) and v,,,(COO) of non-coordinated carboxylato groups, respectively.

The effective magnetic moment per copper atom at room temperature is 2.1 B.M., near to the spinonly value of the copper(I1) ion. When the temperature is lowered the moment decreases very gradually and reaches a value of 1.67 B.M. at 7.2 K. The magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 4 in terms of I/x,,, vs T, where xrn is the molar magnetic susceptibility per copper atom and T the temperature. The complex obeys the Curie-Weiss law l/xm = C(T-O), with C = 2.44 emu-' K-' mol and 8 = - 1.24 K. This

Crystal structure and properties of a copper(H) complex behaviour suggests that a very weak antiferromagnetic interaction operates between the copper(I1) ions. It seems that the bridging bpc ligand is non-planar so that no effective antiferromagnetic exchange coupling can be transmitted.
