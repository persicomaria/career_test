The Structure of Nitric Oxide Synthase Oxygenase Domain and Inhibitor Complexes
Brian R. Crane,* Andrew S. Arvai, Ratan Gachhui, Chaoqun Wu, Dipak K. Ghosh, Elizabeth D. Getzoff, Dennis J. Stuehr, John A. Tainer
The nitric oxide synthase oxygenase domain (NOSox) oxidizes arginine to synthesize the cellular signal and defensive cytotoxin nitric oxide (NO). Crystal structures determined for cytokine-inducible NOSox reveal an unusual fold and heme environment for stabilization of activated oxygen intermediates key for catalysis. A winged sheet engenders a curved - domain resembling a baseball catcher's mitt with heme clasped in the palm. The location of exposed hydrophobic residues and the results of mutational analysis place the dimer interface adjacent to the heme-binding pocket. Juxtaposed hydrophobic O2- and polar L-arginine­binding sites occupied by imidazole and aminoguanidine, respectively, provide a template for designing dual-function inhibitors and imply substrate-assisted catalysis.

Nitric

oxide is a reactive, gaseous, lipophilic molecule that functions at high concentrations as a defensive cytotoxin against tumor cells and pathogens, and at low concentrations as a signal in many diverse physiological processes including blood flow regulation, neurotransmission, learning, and memory (1, 2). Nitric oxide is notable among signals for its rapid diffusion, ability to permeate cell membranes, and intrinsic instability, properties that eliminate the need for extracellular NO receptors or targeted NO degradation. Nitric oxide synthases (NOSs), expressed as cytokine-inducible (iNOS), endothelial (eNOS), and neuronal (nNOS) isozymes, oxidize L-arginine (L-Arg) to NO and citrulline, thereby controlling NO distribution and concentrations in higher eukaryotes (1, 2). The iNOS isozyme is critical for the immune response, but it is also implicated in most diseases involving NO overproduction. Constitutive eNOS and nNOS generate NO that is imperative for blood circulation and signal transmission in the nervous system (1). Pathologies linked to excessive NO production include immunetype diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, carcinogenesis, septic

shock, multiple sclerosis, transplant rejection, and stroke, and pathologies linked to insufficient NO production include hypertension, impotence, arteriosclerosis, and susceptibility to infection (1­3). Isozymespecific inhibitors of NOS, particularly of iNOS, are desirable both for medicinal purposes and to advance our understanding of basic physiology (3). NOS generates NO from a two-step, heme-based oxidation of L-Arg that forms N -hydroxy-L-arginine (NOH-L-Arg) as a stable intermediate (2, 4, 5). The first step likely involves a mixed-function oxidation similar to those catalyzed by the cytochrome P-450s: L-Arg O2 NADPH H 7 NOH-L-Arg H2O NADP (6, 7). Further oxidation of NOH-L-Arg may proceed by an unusual mechanism where one electron from NADPH [the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP )], one electron from NOH-L-Arg, and O2 form a dioxygen-iron species that attacks the guanidino carbon of the resulting NOH-L-Arg radical, leading to oxygen incorporation and C-N bond scission: NOH-L-Arg O2 1/2 (NADPH H ) 7 L-citrulline NO H2O 1/2 NADP (2, 8). NOS isozymes differ in size (130 to 160 kD), amino acid sequence (50 to 60% identity between any two isozymes), tissue distribution, transcriptional regulation, and activation by intracellular calcium (1), but they share an overall three-component construction (1, 2, 4, 5): (i) an NH2-terminal catalytic oxygenase domain (NOSox, residues 1 to 498 for iNOS) that binds heme (iron protoporphyrin IX), tetrahydroSCIENCE VOL. 278

biopterin (H4B), and the substrate L-Arg; (ii) a COOH-terminal reductase domain (NOSred, residues 531 to 1144 for iNOS) that binds flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and NADPH; and (iii) an intervening calmodulin-binding region (residues 499 to 530 for iNOS) that regulates electronic communication between NOSox and NOSred (5, 9). Dimerization of NOSox, promoted by L-Arg and H4B, is necessary for catalytic activity in vitro (2, 4, 5, 9) and may regulate activity in vivo (9). Although NH2-terminal truncation of iNOSox after residue 114 attenuates dimerization (10), some catalytic activity is retained (11). Analogously truncated eNOS that includes NOSred binds L-Arg and H4B and retains up to 12% of native activity (12). Structure determination and domain fold of iNOSox. Structures from orthorhombic crystals (13) containing one molecule per asymmetric unit of iNOSox 114 (residues 115 through 498 plus a COOH-terminal tag of six histidines for affinity purification) in complex with imidazole (Table 1, P212121IM) and with aminoguanidine and imidazole (Table 1, P212121-AG) were determined to 2.1 and 2.3 Å resolution, respectively, by multiple isomorphous replacement (Table 1) (14, 15). We resolved discontinuities in the polypeptide chain arising from weak electron density for projecting loop regions in the orthorhombic crystal form (residues 328 to 335, 383 to 401, and 446 to 477) by also determining a 2.6 Å resolution iNOSox 114 structure from a P213 cubic crystal form obtained by cocrystallization with Escherichia coli type I chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) (Table 1, P213-IM) (16). The cubic lattice packing enforced by the CAT trimer stabilized the projecting loop regions, leaving only one disordered surface loop (residues 449 to 457) in an otherwise nearly identical iNOSox structure. The iNOSox 114 structure reveals an elongated, curved molecule (80 Å by 57 Å by 30 Å) with an unusual nonmodular, single-domain - fold that resembles a baseball catcher's mitt for the left hand (Figs. 1 to 3). Heme is clasped in the mitt's webbed sheet palm with its distal face directed toward a large exposed cavity ( 20 Å across and 11 Å deep) where two imidazole molecules are found in both crystal forms (Fig. 1A). The fold's dominant feature is a winged sheet, with projecting hairpins and flanking helices (Fig. 1A). Three long, antiparallel strands ( 4, 8, and 9), each composed of three segments (labeled a, b, and c), zigzag across the length of the structure (Fig. 1B). The middle segments and two preceding parallel strands form the main five-stranded mixed

sheet, whereas the end segments participate in four- and six-stranded wings, each roughly perpendicular to the main sheet and coplanar with each other (Fig. 1). Two - rolls mount 3 and 4, respectively, under each wing and alongside the main sheet, whereas a third - roll wraps 5 with 4c and 6a from the six-stranded wing. The conformational uniqueness of conserved Pro and Gly residues (Fig. 2) and specific side-chain to main-chain hydrogen bonds allow for the extensive hydrogen bond switching between zigzagged strand pairs that is needed for wing formation. Long helical hairpins cap both ends of the winged sheet, and a fifth long helix runs lengthwise between these hairpins (Fig. 1). The iNOSox polypeptide topology was not detected among other known protein structures by the similarity search program Dali (17); however, the high sequence conservation of many key structural and active-site residues among the three NOS isoforms (Fig. 2) indicates that eNOS and nNOS share the unusual iNOSox fold. The NOS heme environment. The NOS distal heme pocket, primarily constructed from structure, differs consider-

ably from the distal pockets of heme-based oxygenases, oxidases, peroxidases, and catalases, which are largely -helical [survey of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18)]. In these iNOSox structures, the low-spin ferric heme iron is axially coordinated to proximal Cys194 (2.3 Å bond), consistent with mutagenesis and spectroscopic data (19­ 22), and to exogenous imidazole (2.0 Å bond) (Figs. 1A and 4). Most proximal interactions with the heme involve the 32 loop containing Cys194, whereas the hydrophobic distal pocket is formed by residues from the main sheet ( 8b and 9b), 9c, and the four-stranded wing ( 8c) (Fig. 1). An arc of conserved hydrophobic residues (Phe363, Val346, Pro344, Tyr367, Ile372, and Met368) curves around the heme coordination site (Figs. 2 and 4). Proximal Trp188 and distal Phe363 sandwich the porphyrin ring, whereas additional conserved hydrophobic residues (Leu203, Ile238, Trp366, Met368, Met428, Tyr483, and Tyr485) along with Ser236 encircle the heme's edge, leaving only the heme carboxylates to extend into solvent (Fig. 4). Differences between the ring D propionate orientations found in the cubic and orthorhombic crystal forms

affect heme ruffling and suggest that conformational switching of this pyrrole propionate can occur and may affect heme planarity, dimer formation, or catalysis. Although the immediate distal heme pocket in NOS is largely hydrophobic and devoid of hydrogen-donating groups (Fig. 2, blue boxed), polar residues at the pocket edge (Fig. 2, cyan boxed; Fig. 4) may influence L-Arg or H4B binding and dimerization. The closest hydrophilic residue to the heme iron, Glu371, hydrogen bonds to the second imidazole and is required for L-Arg binding (23, 24), thereby localizing the substrate binding site over heme pyrrole rings A and B (Fig. 4). The high residue identity among the three NOS isozymes within the observed heme environment (Fig. 2; blue and cyan boxed) suggests that differences in activity among isozymes are manifested by sequence variability in the NH2-terminal region and the dimer and reductase domain interfaces. The dramatic differences in fold, heme location, and heme environment between iNOSox and the known cytochrome P-450 structures emphasize that these two enzyme families have achieved similar catalytic ac-

tivity through convergent evolution (Fig. 5). Despite similarities among NOSs and P-450s in the Arg-Cys-Ile-Gly-Arg sequence flanking the proximal Cys ligand (25) (Fig. 5), the charge density on the iNOS proximal Cys194 thiolate should be reduced by additional hydrogen bonds to the thiolate from the peptide nitrogen at position 3, and the indole nitrogen of Trp188, along with a Gln-to-Arg replacement at position 3 for hydrogen bonding to the Cys carbonyl. Lower electron density on the cysteine thiolate of iNOS is consistent with increased stretching frequencies of heme-bound CO in NOSs as compared with P-450s (22). Chloroperoxidase, an enzyme with both peroxidase and monooxygenation activities (26), also has additional hydrogen bonds to its proximal cysteine (PDB code 1cpo) that correlate with a decreased heme-thiolate interaction indicated by vibrational spectroscopy (22). Inhibitor binding and domain interfaces. Two juxtaposed molecules of the NOS inhibitor imidazole occupy the distal pocket in both crystal forms of iNOSox (Figs. 1A, 4, and 6A), explaining the effects of imidazole on heme spectra, substrate binding, and dimerization. One imidazole (IM1) binds directly to the heme iron as a sixth ligand and resides deep in the distal pocket, making no hydrogen bonds to any protein residues, whereas the second (IM2) resides above the edge of heme pyrrole ring A and hydrogen bonds with Glu371 (Figs. 4 and 6A). IM1 coordination of the heme iron accounts for the low-spin shift in the heme electronic state caused by imidazole (27, 28), whereas IM2 interaction with Glu371 likely explains competitive inhibition of LArg and H4B binding by imidazole and its ability to promote dimerization (11, 28). Van der Waals interactions of Val346 and Phe363 with IM1 tilt the ligand 10° from the heme normal toward Glu371 and IM2 (Fig. 6A). Similar contacts would direct dioxygen species angularly bound to the heme toward Glu371 and thereby facilitate oxygen-substrate interactions. This unexpected discovery of two distinct, adjacent imidazole binding sites has important implications for drug design. Dual-function inhibitors that simultaneously bind both Glu371 and the heme would expand the binding region to increase affinity and would block L-Arg and dioxygen binding, preventing formation of toxic, reactive oxygen species at the heme iron. Because the characteristics of NOS inhibition by imidazole vary among isozymes and species (28), dualfunction inhibitors may also afford isozymeselective inhibition. When soaked into the iNOSox 114 crystals at 10 mM, the L-Arg analog and mechanism-based inactivator aminoguanidine (29) binds in the distal pocket adjacent to the heme by interacting directly with Glu371, replacing IM2 (Fig. 6B). Aminoguanidine stacks over a heme meso carbon (CHB) and the edge of pyrrole ring A at an angle 45° to the heme plane.

This configuration places both guanidino terminal nitrogens of aminoguanidine within hydrogen-bonding distance of the Trp366 peptide carbonyl at the pocket's base and directs one terminal guanidino nitrogen toward where heme-bound activated oxygen, implicated in the conversion of L-Arg to NOH-L-Arg, would reside. Such close proximity between the heme iron and a gua-

The large, central, winged sheet (orange arrows) includes four-stranded (left, including 9a) and six-stranded (right, including 6b) wings (shown in the foreground, roughly planar with the page) that diverge from the main fivestranded (including 2) sheet (on edge, center). The winged sheet forms the palm (facing left) and fingers (pointing up) of a baseball catcher's mitt for the left hand padded with peripheral helices (blue). The heme (white bonds with red oxygen and blue nitrogen atoms) is held in the pocket of the glove by the thumb (at left), formed by 3, 2, and the loop between them (green tube). Two imidazoles (white bonds with blue nitrogen atoms) bind in the active site distal pocket (right of heme): one coordinates the heme iron (magenta sphere), and the other hydrogen bonds to Glu371 (labeled E371).

The schematic is roughly a flattened representation of (A). In the winged sheet, many strands (arrows) switch hydrogen-bonding partners to participate in more than one of the component structures: main five-stranded sheet (blue), four-stranded wing (magenta), six-stranded wing (green), and projecting strand pairs (black). The heme (open square with central Fe) packs against the main sheet. The flanking helices (white boxes) lie predominantly along one side (left) of this single-domain fold.

nidino nitrogen is consistent with models for NOS catalysis (2, 4, 8) and may explain how various L-Arg analogs can differentially affect the electronic properties of the heme iron (20) as well as the vibrational frequencies and stability of heme ligands such as NO, CO, and O2 bound in the NOS active center (22, 30, 31). Superimposing the guanidinum group of L-Arg on that of NOSbound aminoguanidine (so as to avoid unrealistically close contacts with the protein) orients the L-Arg aliphatic side chain toward the proposed dimer interface at the edge of the distal pocket (see below), placing the amino acid group near Gln257, Arg260, Tyr367 (Figs. 4 and 6B), and Tyr 341 (32). A similar location of L-Arg in the active site of dimeric iNOS would position a terminal guanidino nitrogen close enough to the heme iron to interact directly with iron-bound oxygen species and would also spatially permit hydroxylation of this terminal nitrogen. These structural results, coupled with the observation that the reduction of one heme is sufficient to drive NO synthesis in an intact iNOSox dimer (9), indicate that the two active centers in dimeric NOS likely function independently of one another. The location of the second imidazole at the edge of the open distal heme pocket in the cupped palm of iNOSox 114, together with the distribution of exposed conserved hydrophobic residues, highly mobile regions, and dimer-destabilizing mutations on the exposed surface, all suggest the same mode for NOS dimer assembly. The isozyme-conserved, exposed, hydrophobic surface area of iNOSox 114 (Figs. 2 and 3) is unusually large-- over twice that found in cytochrome P-450cam (PDB code 2cpp), a soluble mono-

oxygenase of similar size but different structure (32). More than 90% of this conserved hydrophobic surface area maps adjacent to the concave face of iNOSox that includes the distal heme pocket (Fig. 3). Regions of iNOSox 114 with the highest crystallographic thermal factors ( 9 and the 7b6, 7- 8, 9- 11, and 11- 12 loops) and mutation sites that inhibit dimer for-

mation, H4B binding, and substrate binding (Figs. 2 and 3A) cluster on this same face. Subunit dimerization in conjunction with H4B or L-Arg binding likely stabilizes and possibly conformationally alters these mobile regions and the flexible, missing NH2-terminus. The open distal pocket in the NOSox subunit contrasts with the buried distal heme pockets of the cyto-

RESEARCH ARTICLE
chromes P-450, which are sequestered within the protein core to exclude bulk solvent and thereby control the heme redox potential, production of heme-bound activated oxygen, and catalysis (6, 7, 33). A primary function of NOS dimerization, manifested by a twofold symmetric association that buries and orders these exposed, hydrophobic, and mobile regions, is to confer stability and reduce solvent exposure of the distal heme pocket, thereby allowing the oxygen activation needed for catalysis. Assuming that dimerization sequesters the heme environment as described above, the remaining exposed, conserved hydrophobic residues (including Phe148, Ile198, Leu321, and Met368) (Fig. 2) located on the opposing convex iNOSox surface formed by 2, 4, 9, and 10 may interface with the FMN-binding region of iNOSred, which is likely to be suitably concave by structural analogy to cytochrome P-450 reductase (34). This would allow electron transfer from iNOSred to the heme edge that is adjacent to Trp366 and 6 Å from the surface (Figs. 4 and 6B). Implications for catalysis and regulation. Comparing iNOSox structures with other hemoprotein monooxygenase and peroxidase structures identifies special features that may enable function as an NO synthase. As in the cytochrome P-450s, oxygen activation by NOS probably generates discrete intermediates: P-Fe(III) e O2 3 P-Fe(III)-O2

Fig. 4. The heme environment. Stereoview shows distal pocket (above) and proximal heme environment (below) in the cubic crystal form, with the C trace colored magenta and side chains in yellow with red oxygen, blue nitrogen, and green sulfur atoms. Two imidazole molecules (white) bind in the distal pocket: IM1 coordinates directly to the heme (gold, with magenta iron), whereas IM2 hydrogen bonds to Glu371 (E371), and both hydrogen bond to a water molecule (red sphere) at the edge of the pocket. On the proximal heme side, hydrogen bonds (white dots) from the indole nitrogen of Trp188 ( W188), which stacks with the heme plane, and the peptide nitrogens of Gly196 and Arg197 (R197) stabilize the charge and conformation of the proximal cysteine thiolate heme ligand Cys194 (C194). To the left Arg193 (R193) hydrogen bonds with the heme ring C carboxylate and shields the heme edge from solvent.

Fig. 5. Comparison of the proximal heme-binding regions of iNOSox and cytochrome P450s. Structural elements contributing to the proximal hemebinding regions of iNOSox 114 and P450cam (cyan C traces) are substantially different. Only the proximal Cys ligands (magenta bonds with yellow sulfur atoms, bound to gold hemes) and immediately COOH-terminal three residues (magenta C traces) have similar conformations. In iNOSox, Cys194 lies at the COOH-terminal end of a helix and precedes an extended strand, whereas in P450cam, Cys357 lies at the NH2-terminal end of a helix and follows an extended strand. Also, these two cysteine thiolates bind opposite faces of iron protoporphyrin IX. C positions for iNOSox 114 residues 194 to 197 were superimposed with P450cam residues 357 to 360 and then separated for clarity. 429

In analogy to P-450 monooxygenations (6, 7), NOS also likely uses hypervalent oxoiron (P -Fe(IV) O, where P is a porphyrin -cation radical) to hydroxylate L-Arg to NOH-L-Arg in the first step of NO synthesis. However, in the second step, peroxoiron [P-Fe(III)-O22­], formed from the oneelectron reduction of superoxide-iron [PFe(III)-O2-] by NOH-L-Arg, may act to convert the NOH-L-Arg radical to NO and citrulline (2, 4, 8). In P-450s, the coordination of an electronegative thiolate to the heme iron and the presence of water- or protein-based proton donors are thought to promote generation of oxo-iron from peroxo-iron (6, 7). In contrast, the NOSox structure may stabilize peroxo-iron relative to oxo-iron by extensive hydrogen bonding to diminish the electronegativity of the heme thiolate ligand, and by the absence in the distal heme pocket of structured water molecules or protein residues that could

otherwise donate protons to facilitate scission of the peroxo-iron O­O bond. Indeed, mutations that remove proton-donating residues from the distal pocket of some P450s increase the proportion of oxidation reactions that proceed through peroxorather than oxo-iron (35). Because attenuated O­O bond cleaving activity is required for the second step of NO synthesis, NOS may need additional structural features, absent in the P-450s, to facilitate oxo-iron formation in the first step of the reaction. For example, Trp188 and Phe363 stack with the heme in iNOSox, a feature important for influencing the electronic and catalytic properties of peroxidases, including formation of oxo-iron porphyrin -cation radical species [P -Fe O(IV)] (36). This aromatic stacking may provide quadrupole interactions or resonance delocalization to stabilize the porphyrin -cation radical of a NOS oxo-iron species. The aminoguanidine geometry in the iNOSox active center suggests that substrate-assisted oxygen activation acts in NO synthesis. Heme peroxidases contain a catalytically key, conserved, distal Arg (Arg44 in cytochrome c peroxidase) that stacks over the heme's edge and directs its N toward the heme iron with a configuration similar to the terminal aminoguanidine nitrogen in the iNOSox-aminoguanidine

Two adjacent imidazoles (IM1 and IM2) bind in the distal pocket. The heme-bound imidazole (IM1) is inclined from the heme normal by 10° because of van der Waals contacts (upper left) with Val346 ( V346) and Phe363 (F363). (B) The 2.3 Å resolution refined model (yellow carbon, red oxygen, blue nitrogen, and Fcalc omit electron density map (purple, 3.5 and red, 7.5 basketgreen sulfur bonds) and Fobs weave contours) for aminoguanidine complexed with iNOSox 114. Aminoguanidine (AG) binds alongside the heme-bound imidazole (IM1) above pyrrole ring A and hydrogen bonds (dashed white lines) with both guanidino terminal nitrogens to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Trp366 ( W366), and with terminal amino and guanidino nitrogens to the Glu371 (E371) carboxylate. The other terminal guanidino nitrogen is directed toward the heme distal axial coordination position, where activated oxygen is created for L-Arg hydroxylation.

complex (Fig. 6B). The importance of this Arg for forming oxo-iron in peroxidases (37) suggests that L-Arg in NOS supplies hydrogen-bonding interactions to help generate the oxo-iron intermediate needed for its own conversion to NOH-L-Arg. The unusual fold, structure, and assembly of NOSox are well adapted for the catalytic and regulatory requirements of NO. The NOSox winged sheet and elongated structure place the heme and L-Arg binding site near the protein surface and proposed dimer interface, orient the L-Arg charged amino acid group for interaction with the other subunit or pterin at the pocket's exposed hydrophilic rim, and project the LArg guanidinium group toward the heme iron for interaction with activated oxygen in a hydrophobic environment. An active center created by an interface allows substrate and effector molecules such as H4B and calmodulin to modulate catalysis by

affecting associations between domains and subunits. Although NO synthesis by the one-electron reduction of nitrite, as catalyzed by many prokaryotic dissimilatory nitrite reductases (38), is far simpler than by the complicated oxidation of L-Arg catalyzed by multimeric NOSs, it is less conducive to regulation. Thus, NO may have evolved to be an effective signal in higher organisms not only because of its unique chemical properties, but also because of the regulatory opportunities provided by its synthesis from L-Arg by NOS.

Crystallization trials with dimeric, full-length murine iNOSox identified a favored truncation product, with the NH2-terminal 114 residues removed, conducive to crystal growth under select conditions. Inducible NOSox 114 (including a fused COOH-terminal His6 tag) was overexpressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-chelate chromatography as described previously (10, 39). Orthorhombic iNOSox 114 crystals of space group P212121 (cell dimensions 63.0 Å by 73.8 Å by 92.8 Å, one molecule per asymmetric unit, 2.3 Å3/dalton, solvent Matthews coefficient VM content 48%) were grown at 32°C from drops containing iNOSox 114 (10 mg/ml), 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 50 mM imidazole/malate (IM/M), pH 5.0, 2.5% saturated Na2SO3, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DT T), and 8% PEG MW 4000 (polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 4000) (final pH of 6.5) by vapor diffusion against reservoir containing 100 mM IM/M, pH 5.0, 5% saturated Na2SO3, and 16% PEG MW 4000. Cubic crystals (space group P213, cell dimension of 147.5 Å, VM 3.8 Å3/dalton, solvent content 68%) of an iNOSox 114 ­E. coli K-12 type I CAT 1:1 complex, obtained by bimolecular crystallization, were grown at 22°C from drops containing iNOSox 114 (10 mg/ml), CAT ( 5 mg/ ml), 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM DT T, 50 mM IM/M, pH 5.0, 27.5% saturated Na2SO4 (final pH of 6.5) by vapor diffusion against reservoir containing 100 mM IM/M, pH 5.0 and 55% saturated Na2SO4. The aminoguanidine complex was formed by soaking an orthorhombic iNOSox 114 crystal in 10 mM aminoguanidine carbonate, 40 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, and 12% PEG MW 6000 for 30 hours. 14. All native and derivative diffraction data ( Table 1) were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) on beam lines 7­1 and 9 ­1 at ­170°C, because weak diffraction of iNOSox 114 precluded data collection from rotating anode x-ray sources. Efficient derivative screening at SSRL allowed extensive exploration of heavy atom concentration, buffer conditions, pH, and soaking times for optimizing orthorhombic iNOSox 114 heavy atom derivatives ( Table 1). After data reduction with DENZO [ Z. Otwinowski and W. Minor, Methods Enzymol. 276, 307 (1997)], heavy atom positions were found with Patterson techniques, confirmed by cross-Fourier maps calculated in XtalView (40), and then optimized by origin-removed Patterson refinement in HEAVY [ T. C. Terwilliger and D. Eisenberg, Acta Crystallogr. A39, 813 (1983)]. Structure factor phases to 2.8 Å resolution, calculated from isomorphous and anomalous differences with PHASES [ W. Furey and S. Swaminathan, Am. Cryst. Assoc. Mtg. Abstr. PA33, 18, 73 (1990)] [overall figure of merit (FOM) 0.63], produced an initial experimental electron density map with an average amplitude-weighted phase error versus the final refined structure factors ( ) of 59.6° and a correlation coefficient between the experimental and final 2Fobs Fcalc maps (Rc ) of 0.44. Density modification in DM [K. Cowtan, Joint Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 (CCP4) and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography 31, 34 (1994)] under the restraints of solvent flatness, density histogram matching, and Sayre's equation increased the overall FOM to 0.84 to 50.9°. Model and Rc to 0.55 and decreased building into the DM-modified map with XFIT (40) produced a model containing 57% of total final scat-

Murshudov et al., Proceedings of The Daresbury Study Weekend, p. 157 (1996); CCP4, Acta Crystallogr. D50, 760 (1994)] (Rcryst 46%) and used for partial-model, 45%, Rfree phase-combination with SIGMAA [R. J. Read, Acta Crystallogr.

After cycles of refinement and model building in XFIT and O [ T. A. Jones et al., ibid. A47, 110 (1991)] the resolution was extended to 2.5 Å against a model containing 85% of the final 38.2%, Rfree 43.0%), which scatterers (Rcryst was improved by adding water molecules with ARP [ V. S. Lamzin and K. S. Wilson, ibid. D49, 127 (1993)] applied in restrained mode among 50 cycles of recursive REFMAC refinement (on the final cycle Rcryst 36.0%). We completed refinement 28.6%, Rfree and resolution extension to 2.1 Å in X-PLOR [A. T. Brunger et al., Science 235, 458 (1987)] using the ¨ bulk solvent correction, over cycles of rebuilding to A-weighted 2Fobs ­ Fcalc and Fobs ­ Fcalc omit electron density maps ( Table 1). The mobile loop regions of iNOSox 114 (Fig. 3A) contribute to the refined model but give a high average individual atom isotropic thermal (B) value of 45.2 Å2 (43.5 Å2 for mainchain atoms, 45.4 Å2 for side-chain atoms, and 33.7 Å2 for the imidazole ligands), which agrees with overall B estimates from Wilson statistics. Discernible omit electron density and a decrease in Rfree determined if regions with high B values were included in the model. 15. For determining the structure of P212121-AG, the P212121-IM model with imidazole and water molecules removed was refined against diffraction data for the isomorphous P212121-AG crystal by positional refinement in X-PLOR to 2.3 Å resolution. After the entire molecule was rebuilt to omit maps, aminoguanidine was oriented in the active center, refined, and verified by examining Fobs ­ Fcalc electron density maps. A lower overall B value of 37.0 Å2 (35.8 Å2 for main-chain atoms, 37.8 Å2 for side-chain atoms, for aminoguani32.7 Å for imidazole, and 49.2 dine) reflects more overall order in the orthorhombic aminoguanidine complex compared with the imidazole complex. A 2.4 Å resolution iNOSox 114 model, refined in the orthorhombic space group (Rcryst 26.0%, Rfree 34.0%), was orientated and fitted in the cubic crystal form by AMoRe [J. Navaza, Acta Crystallogr. A50, 157 (1994)], giving a correlation coefficient of 0.36 45.5% against 3.5 Å resolution P213 and Rcryst diffraction data. Positional refinement to 2.9 Å resolution in REFMAC reduced Rcryst to 41.3% and Rfree to 43.7%. A model of type III E. coli CAT refined to 1.75 Å resolution {3cla.pdb [M. R. Gibbs et al., J. Mol. Biol. 213, 167 (1990)]}, 46% identical in sequence to type I CAT, was placed into the type I CAT electron density revealed by A-weighted 2Fobs ­ Fcalc and Fobs ­ Fcalc electron density maps phased with the iNOSox refined molecular replacement solution. Simulated annealing in X-PLOR to 2.8 Å resolution decreased Rcryst to 26.5% and Rfree to 32.9%. Cycles of positional refinement, rebuilding to omit electron density maps, and resolution extension to 2.6 Å completed the model ( Table 1). Disorder in the CAT molecule resulted in a higher overall B value (65.6 Å2 for main-chain atoms, 69.7 Å2 for sidechain atoms, 45.1 Å2 for the imidazole ligands, and 66.6 Å2 overall) for the refined cubic model than for the orthorhombic models, even though the overall B value for iNOSox is similar in both crystal forms.
