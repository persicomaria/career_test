Architecture of a Fungal Fatty Acid ° Synthase at 5 A Resolution
Simon Jenni,* Marc Leibundgut,* Timm Maier, Nenad Ban All steps of fatty acid synthesis in fungi are catalyzed by the fatty acid synthase, which forms a 2.6-megadalton a6b6 complex. We have determined the molecular architecture of this multienzyme by fitting the structures of homologous enzymes that catalyze the individual steps of the reaction pathway into a 5 angstrom x-ray crystallographic electron density map. The huge assembly contains two separated reaction chambers, each equipped with three sets of active sites separated by distances up to È130 angstroms, across which acyl carrier protein shuttles substrates during the reaction cycle. Regions of the electron density arising from well-defined structural features outside the catalytic domains separate the two reaction chambers and serve as a matrix in which domains carrying the various active sites are embedded. The structure rationalizes the compartmentalization of fatty acid synthesis, and the spatial arrangement of the active sites has specific implications for our understanding of the reaction cycle mechanism and of the architecture of multienzymes in general. atty acid synthesis in fungi is compartmentalized in large multifunctional enzymes: the fatty acid synthases (FASs). They function as molecular assembly lines and increase the rate of synthesis by channeling substrates between active sites and achieving high local concentrations of intermediates (1­3). De novo fatty acid synthesis involves the transfer of activated acetyl and malonyl substrates from coenzyme A (CoA) to the prosthetic phosphopantetheine group of acyl carrier protein (ACP) by acetyl transferase (AT) and malonyl/ palmitoyl transferase (MPT) (Fig. 1). Ketoacyl synthase (KS) condenses them by malonyl decarboxylation to acetoacetyl-ACP, which is further modified at the b-carbon position by ketoacyl reductase (KR), dehydratase (DH), and enoyl reductase (ER) to yield butyryl-ACP. These reactions are repeated six times, resulting in the sequential incorporation of seven two-carbon units. In fungi, the palmitoyl end product is transferred back from ACP to CoA by MPT, whereas in the mammalian system, the fatty acid is released from ACP by a thioesterase (4). Despite the conserved reaction pathway, the molecular architectures of FAS systems differ considerably: Most bacteria and plants possess a FAS type-II system with dissociated enzymes encoded by separate genes (5). Highly integrated FAS type-I multienzyme systems are present in mammals, with all catalytic activities taking place on an a2 homodimer of 270-kD polypeptides (4), and in fungi, where the individual enzymatic functions are distributed on a 210-kD a chain and a 230-kD b chain (Fig. 1) (3). In addition, the C terminus of the fungal a chain encodes the phosphopantetheine transferase (PT) required for ACP activation by phosphopantetheine transfer (6). Fungal FAS is an a6b6 heterododecameric com-

plex with a molecular weight of 2.6 MD. According to electron microscopic results, FAS assembles into a hollow rotational ellipsoid with 32-point group symmetry (7­12). Several Aspergillus strains use a closely homologous FAS (HexA/B) to produce hexanoic acid, a precursor substrate for the synthesis of aflatoxin and related mycotoxins (13­15). A related FAS type-I system is also present in Mycobacteria and Corynebacteria, encoded by a single large gene with fused b and a chains. It is proposed to synthesize precursors for mycolic acids, which are deposited in the bacterial cell wall and form an effective protective layer (16, 17). Several x-ray crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance structures of homologous FAS type-II proteins in complex with cofactors, substrates, or inhibitors illustrate the molecular basis of individual chemical reactions at the atomic level. However, it is not understood how multiple catalytic domains assemble into large multifunctional complexes and form a reaction environment suitable for the coordinated biosynthesis of fatty acids. To understand the archi° tecture of fungal FAS, we calculated a 5 A­ resolution x-ray crystallographic electron density map, into which we positioned homologous crystal structures for the enzymes KS, KR, DH, MPT, and AT, together with a triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel that constitutes the flavin mononucleotide (FMN)­binding domain of the ER. The accurate positions and orientations of the catalytic domains and their active sites define the architecture of the assembly with implications for the understanding of its function. Structure determination. FAS was isolated from the filamentous fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus and crystallized. Initial phases were ° obtained at 8 A resolution from crystals derivatized with heavy atom clusters (18). Phases were then extended by density modification to approximate° ly 5 A resolution, as judged from the appearance of a helices and b sheets in the resulting experimental electron density map. Although, at this resolution, the protein backbone cannot be unambiguously traced, distinct protein folds SCIENCE VOL 311

formed by combinations of various secondary structure elements are readily recognizable. This allowed us to interpret the map by placing homologous high-resolution structures of individual domains into the electron density map. Identification of functional domains. Bacterial KS adopts a thiolase fold and forms homodimers in solution and in several x-ray structures (19). Consequently, we inspected the FAS electron density map along the twofoldsymmetry axes and could identify the thiolase fold. The structure of the bacterial KS homolog fits almost perfectly into the density (Fig. 2A), particularly in the proximity of the catalytic center. Within the FAS complex, KS forms three dimers and preserves the dimer interface of its bacterial counterpart. In the vicinity of the twofold axis on the other side of the complex, a characteristic four-helix bundle was recognized as one of the dimerization interfaces in the type-II tetrameric KR homolog of Brassica napus (20). KR is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)­dependent enzyme containing a dinucleotide-binding Rossmann fold. The KR domains fit remarkably well into our electron density map (Fig. 2B) and form dimers that correspond to one of the dimers observed in the dissociative type-II FAS system. The closest sequence homolog with known structure to fungal DH is the human peroxisomal 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 involved in b oxidation of fatty acids (21). It is a pseudo-dimer, with two subsequent ``hot dog'' folds, which together form a large characteristic b sheet. This feature and the surrounding electron

AT and MPT catalyze chemically similar acyl transfer reactions. Type-II acyl transferase sequences align to both the AT and MPT regions of the fungal FAS b chain, suggesting that the two enzymes share the same fold. Consequently, we could position the homologous malonyl transferase from Streptomyces coelicolor (27) (Fig. 3A) into two different regions of the FAS electron density map (Fig. 3B and fig. S3). The sequence alignment of bacterial type-II enzymes with the fungal FAS b chain positions the MPT immediately downstream of the DH domain, whereas the AT is separated from the DH by È1150 residues (Fig. 1 and fig. S4). Fitting of the transacylase twice into the electron density map, without any prior assumptions, perfectly aligned the N terminus of one of the domains with the C terminus of the DH and identified it as MPT, and we assigned the other position to AT (Fig. 3C). The terminal ACP and PT domains are connected to the body of the a chain via long, probably flexible, linkers. The ACP-flanking Pro/Ala/Gly-rich sequences are comparable to the linkers between moving domains of pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes (28, 29). As one might expect, at least for ACP, we could not identify electron density that would corre° spond to the ACP and PT structures in the 5 A­ resolution map. However, maps calculated at lower resolution reveal additional features in the interior and at the top of the particle (fig. S5A). The threefold related density at the apices might account for the PT, which forms homotrimers in the bacterial counterpart (fig. S5C) (30). The density observed in the interior may represent an attachment point to which ACP is flexibly tethered or a structural feature that facilitates substrate channeling (fig. S5B). Overall architecture of the fungal FAS. The overall barrel shape of the FAS structure has a ° ° height of 260 A and a width of 230 A (Fig. 4A). Based on the placement of homologous structures, we present the three-dimensional domain organization within the multifunctional FAS assembly (Fig. 4C). The KS and KR dimers are located on the twofold axes and form the equatorial region of the barrel. In the connection emerging from the KR, we find the MPT. The second main portion of the density departing from the central region leads to the ER. Finally, AT and DH, together with parts of the ER, form the apical ring of the complex (Fig. 4, A and C). This domain distribution is consistent with studies of antibody cross-linking between FAS particles (7) and with chemical distance mapping of the subunits within one complex (31), and it corroborates the idea that the central part is built from a chains and that the b chains form the arches of the domes on either side of the particle (Fig. 4D). The catalytic domains are embedded in a network of ``structural'' density. The central slice of the assembly forms a wheel-like structure (Fig. 4B). The hub of the wheel is built from six tightly packed a helices that emanate

(D) Side and top views of the TIM-barrel fold, which represents the FMN-binding part of the fungal ER. The closest fit to the electron density map was obtained using a FMN-containing oxidoreductase (PDB accession code 1GOX). density allowed the fit of both the C-terminal half, which shows highest sequence homology to fungal FAS and harbors the catalytic site of the hydratase, and the N-terminal half, which is involved in the binding of bulky substrates (Fig. 2C). DH structures of the bacterial FAS homologs (22, 23) resemble the peroxisomal hydratase fold but are true homodimers and fit less well into our electron density map. The overall architecture of the fungal DH is thus substantially more complex than in type-II FAS systems and resembles the hydratase fold known from fatty acid b oxidation. The fungal NADPH-dependent ER is, in contrast to the other FAS systems, a FMNcontaining oxidoreductase (24). ERs from different fungal and mycobacterial type-I FAS systems share high sequence conservation, but no homology to any structurally characterized protein has been observed, including to ER type-II enzymes. We therefore inspected currently unassigned electron density regions and discovered a TIM-barrel fold (Fig. 2D). Among 21 known TIM-barrel superfamilies, one is a class of FMN-dependent oxidoreductases (25). A good fit to the electron density map was obtained with the coordinates of spinach glycolate oxidase (26), which contains FMN as a cofactor in the catalytic center. Based on these observations, we propose that the FMN-binding part of fungal ER consists of a TIM-barrel fold. Adjacent to the FMN-binding pocket of the TIM barrel we observed an additional, predominantly a-helical domain, clearly different from a Rossmann fold, which may constitute the NADPH-binding part of the ER (fig. S2). VOL 311 SCIENCE

toward the upper and lower chamber on each side of the wheel. Spokes radiate from the hub and join the domains arranged on the outer circular frame. The KR domains are connected ° to the center via single È40 A­long a helices, whereas the second type of spoke originating from the KS dimer is larger and of a more complex fold. We observed additional density at the periphery of the wheel, including two bundles of a helices: one bundle joining the KS with the KR and the other probably involved in KS dimerization. An even longer a helix of ° È50 A originates from the KR, runs in the longitudinal direction along the shell of the particle, and terminates in the middle of one of the two large openings of the barrel, where it contacts a currently unassigned domain (Fig. 4A). The architecture of fungal FAS exemplifies how individual catalytic domains are assembled into a multifunctional enzyme. Gene fusion of individual proteins from a biosynthetic pathway into multidomain-coding sequences facilitates stoichiometric protein expression. The catalytic core domains of dissociative enzymes preserved their dimeric interactions in the multienzyme complex, as observed for KS and KR. We presume that the whole assembly gradually evolved by acquiring insertions and mutations in the linker regions at the periphery of the core domains. This created new protein interaction surfaces, resulting in higher order assemblies with improved catalytic properties. The reaction chamber. Within fungal FAS, there are two identical large reaction chambers separated by the central wheel. Each of the two

reaction chambers is equipped with three copies of a full set of catalytic domains required for fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 5A and fig. S6). The KS and KR dimers embedded in the base of the chambers expose one of their active sites to either the upper or the lower compartment. Similarly, the entrances to the active sites of the b-chain enzymes are accessible from the interior. Consequently, the reaction substrates and products enter and leave the reaction chambers by passive diffusion through the openings in the particle wall. ° With a diameter of up to È25 A, the holes are large enough to allow the passage of small molecules but provide a barrier to macromolecules. Considering the internal arrangement of the catalytic sites and the cagelike structure of FAS, we propose that the ACPs are confined in the reaction chambers, because this would be the only mechanism by which ACP could accomplish substrate transfer. Large conformational changes within the FAS assembly that would alter the arrangement of catalytic sites during synthesis are not indicated by the structure; first, because of the fact that the particle maintains ° noncrystallographic symmetry to at least 5 A resolution; and second, because most catalytic centers are embedded in a matrix of structural density. The observed distances between the ° active sites directly indicate that the 18 A­long phosphopantetheine arm of ACP is much too short to reach all the catalytic centers by itself. Thus, ACP must move from one catalytic domain to the next during the reaction cycle, as postulated by Lynen (1) but not reflected in many textbooks. A mechanistically comparable process involving a swinging domain has also been proposed for pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes (28, 29). Therefore, the long phosphopantetheine arm of ACP does not function as a swinging arm to pass substrates from domain to domain, but is rather required to deliver the acyl chain intermediates into the deep hydrophobic clefts of the active sites. A comprehensive set of active sites is approximately equidistant from the internal structural feature (a possible attachment point for ACP) observed at lower resolution (Fig. 5B). The entrances to their catalytic centers are easily accessible from the interior of the reaction chamber (Fig. 5A). Without having the complete trace of the polypeptide chains, we cannot determine whether this combination of active sites originates from single or multiple a and b chains. Furthermore, the observed architecture suggests that ACP might also be able to reach alternative combinations of catalytic centers, which is in agreement with experiments showing in vitro complementation between mutant FAS complexes (32). The sequential transfer of ACP from one catalytic domain to the next is schematically illustrated in Fig. 5C. The acetyl primer substrate would be delivered to the KS from the AT located at the top. In this initial step, which is carried out only once during the reaction cycle, ACP must traverse

(C) Schematic path of ACP, shown as a gray sphere, during substrate shuttling between the active sites. the entire height of the reaction chamber. The MPT, on the other hand, is located directly above the KS, which may facilitate repetitive translocation of the elongation substrate. The condensed substrate from the KS would then be handed over to the KR, DH, and ER, following the figure-eight path depicted in Fig. 5C, until ACP brings the fully reduced intermediate back to the KS for the next elongation cycle. Compartmentalization of fatty acid synthesis. Compartmentalization of fatty acid synthesis has the biological advantage of substrate channeling (33). In this process, the reaction intermediates covalently attached to ACP are prevented from diffusing into the bulk cytoplasm during transfer between the active sites. In addition, the concentration of ACP, and consequently also of all other active sites, within the chamber is approximately 1 mM, which ensures that none of the bimolecular reaction steps are rate limiting. This architectural solution has clear advantages over the FAS type-II system, with dissociated enzymes. Escherichia coli, for example, has to maintain very high concentrations of individual macroVOL 311 SCIENCE molecules that participate in these reactions, and ACP itself is the most abundant enzyme in the bacterial cytosol present at approximately 100 mM concentration (34, 35). Therefore, compartmentalization in the fungal FAS increases the apparent concentration of ACP by an order of magnitude without the need to maintain high concentrations of FAS. In addition, the regulation of the reaction cycle can be more easily controlled: Only the FAS a and b chains, instead of eight individual proteins, have to be expressed in a concerted manner, and the basic capacity for the production of fatty acids can be controlled by the expression level of the FAS complex (3). However, FAS-dependent synthesis of full-length fatty acids depends on sufficient amounts of malonyl-CoA, the production of which is regulated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (36, 37). The structure of the fungal FAS complex presented here provides first glimpses of the remarkable architectural principles that are used in megasynthases. Investigations of various aspects of FAS function through structure-based biochemical and genetic experiments can now

REPORTS Grain Size­Sensitive Creep in Ice II
Tomoaki Kubo,1* William B. Durham,2 Laura A. Stern,3 Stephen H. Kirby3 Rheological experiments on fine-grained water ice II at low strain rates reveal a creep mechanism that dominates at conditions of low stress. Using cryogenic scanning electron microscopy, we observed that a change in stress exponent from 5 to 2.5 correlates strongly with a decrease in grain size from about 40 to 6 micrometers. The grain size­sensitive creep of ice II demonstrated here plausibly dominates plastic strain at the low-stress conditions in the interior of medium- to large-sized icy moons of the outer solar system. igh-pressure phases of water ice are major constituents of the interiors of low-density icy moons with radii of 9700 km, namely Ganymede and Callisto (Jupiter); Titan, Rhea, and Iapetus (Saturn); Titania and Oberon (Uranus); and Triton (Neptune) (1). These moons were warmed by accretional heating and are often internally heated, either by tidal stresses of a nearby giant planet or by radioactive decay of a rocky component. The rheology of ice, as described by the rela  tionship e º f ðsÞ between a strain rate e and differential stress s, can control the thermal evolution and internal dynamics of icy moons (2­6). Typically, in crystalline solids the stress  sensitivity is described by a power law, e º sn , where the stress exponent n is a constant. Creep experiments have been carried out at creep and superplasticity (13, 16)^ contribute proportionally more to the total strain rate than do mechanisms of higher n. For planetary applications, it is essential to identify and characterize creep mechanisms that may dominate at low stresses. We report results of creep experiments with the use of fine-grained ice II at low­strain rate conditions to 10j8 sj1. We synthesized finegrained ice II by rapid cycling of the transformation from ice II to ice I (II-I transformation), followed by repressurization, and observed and measured ice II grain size with the use of a cryogenic scanning electron microscope (SEM). Using these techniques, we found a low-n creep mechanism that is weaker than GSI creep in ice II and dominant at lower stresses and finer grain sizes. Synthesis of the ice II samples and subsequent creep experiments were carried out in a cryogenic gas-medium deformation apparatus (10, 17). The starting ice I (18) samples with a grain size of about 250 mm were transformed to ice II by pressurizing to È300 MPa at a constant pumping rate,

pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions relevant to the interiors of icy moons to determine the flow law of several high-pressure phases (7­12). In those studies, differential stresses were relatively high and the grain size of samples was not controlled or examined. In all measurements to date on the high-pressure phases of ice, the stress exponent is relatively large (n 9 4), which implies dominance of a grain size­insensitive (GSI) deformation mechanism such as dislocation creep (13). Dislocation creep may not be the dominant mechanism of deformation at the low levels of stress (s G 0.1 MPa) expected in the convecting interiors of icy moons (14, 15).

Gutmann for their outstanding support at the SLS; our colleagues M. Steiner, B. Mikolasek, and C. Frick for their help in FAS preparation; members of the Ban laboratory for suggestions and discussions; H. Gross and W. Baumeister for their help in interpreting electron microscopic images; G. Kaim, T. Meier, U. Bauer, and A. Lehmann for assisting in cell fermentation; C. Vonrhein for a prerelease version of the program SHARP; and D. Sargent for technical assistance. T. lanuginosus expressed sequence tag sequence data were produced by the Fungal Genomics Project (fungalgenomics.concordia.ca). We thank A. Tsang for providing the raw sequencing data and P. Pencek for providing the cryoelectron microscopic map of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae FAS. S.J. was supported by the Swiss Study Foundation and thanks the instructors of the 2003 x-ray course at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and the National Center of Competence in Research Structural Biology program of the SNSF. Coordinates of the rigid-body fitted homologous domains have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 2CDH.
